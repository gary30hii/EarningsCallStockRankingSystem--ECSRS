At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to hand the conference over to Richard Galanti. Please go ahead.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you, Laurie, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020, the 16 and 52 weeks ended August 30. Reported net income for the fourth quarter came in at $1.389 billion or $3.13 per diluted share as compared to $1.097 billion or $2.47 a share - per diluted share last year in the fourth quarter. This year\u2019s fourth quarter was negatively impacted by incremental expense related to COVID-19 premium wages and sanitation costs, totaling $281 million pretax or $0.47 a share, as well as a $36 million pre-tax charge or $0.06 per share related to early payment of $1.5 billion of debt.  These items were partially offset by an $84 million pre-tax benefit or $0.15 a share for the partial reversal of reserve of $123 million pretax, $0.22 per diluted share related to our product tax assessment taken in the fourth quarter of last year.  Net sales for the quarter increased 12.5% to $52.28 billion, up from $46.45 billion in the fourth quarter a year earlier. For the fiscal year in its entirety, fiscal 2020 came in at $163.22 billion, a 9.3% increase over the $149.35 billion in fiscal 2019.  Comparable sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 were as follows: On a reported basis for the 16 weeks the U.S. was 11%, excluding gas deflation and FX the U.S. was 13.6%. Canada reported 9.1% up, again ex-gas deflation FX 12.6% up. Other international reported 16.1%, ex-gas deflation in FX, 18.8%, bringing the total company to a reported number of 11.4% comp and again ex-gas deflation and FX up 14.1%. For the company, e-commerce reported was 90.6% up, and ex-gas and FX \u2013FX, 91.3% up.  In terms of the fourth quarter comp sales metrics, foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by about 50 basis points, and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 220 basis points.  Traffic or shopping frequency on a worldwide basis was down 1.2% during the fourth quarter and showed an increase of 1.2% in the U.S. Our average transaction or average basket size was up 12.7% during the fourth quarter, notwithstanding the negative impacts from gas deflation and FX which were included in that number.  We\u2019ve kept you up-to-date in our monthly sales calls on the impacts from the pandemic as we've been able to identify those. Overall merchandise sales in the core, core being food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh, as well as pharmacy have all been strong, while sales in our ancillary, other ancillary, and travel businesses though now open have been soft.  Next, moving down the income statement, membership fee income. We reported a fourth quarter membership fee income of $1.106 billion, up $56 million from $1.05 billion in the fourth quarter of \u201919. The $56 million increase ex-FX would have been $60 million up.  During the quarter we opened eight net new units and 13 for the entire fiscal year. In terms of renewal rates, at fourth quarter end our U.S. and Canada renewal rate remained at 91.0% and worldwide rate also remained at its similar number from a quarter ago at 88.4%.  In terms of the number of members at Q4 end, both member households and card holders, total paid households at fourth quarter end was up \u2013 came in at 58.1 million and card holders 105.5 million.  In the fourth quarter, we standardized the membership count methodology globally, which we had apparently done differently in different markets, North America versus others, and so that increase includes that slight adjustment. The change resulted in adding approximately 1.3 million paid members and 2.0 million card holders to our member base.  So as an example, from Q3 to Q4 when we showed going from 55.8 million to 58.1 million or up 2.3 million, that 2.3 million increase includes the 1.3 million adjustment upwards. Similarly, the $3.7 million increase from the end of third quarter to fourth quarter, that 3.7 million increase includes 2.0 million of an adjustment. I'd like to note however that neither the membership fee income dollars nor the renewal rate calculations were affected by this adjustment. At fourth quarter end, paid executive memberships totaled 22.6 million, an increase of 765,000 during the 16 weeks since third quarter end.  Going down the gross margin line -- going down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin came in at 11.24%, up 18 basis points from last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 11.06%. That 18 basis point increase, excluding gas deflation came in \u2013 would have been minus 4 basis points and excluding a portion of the direct COVID expenses would have been up 8 and I\u2019ll show you that in the numbers that I ask you to jot down here.  If you jot down the following numbers, two columns: First column will be fourth quarter as reported, second column will be fourth quarter ex-gas deflation. The first line item would be core merchandise. Year-over-year on a reported basis, core merchandise was up 101 basis points, ex-gas deflation up 82 basis points, so plus 101 and plus 82 in the first line item.  Ancillary businesses being the second line item reported minus 66 basis points and without gas deflation minus 71. A 2% reward, minus-4 basis points and minus-2 basis points, other minus-13 basis points and minus-13 basis points and that would give you totals on a reported basis of plus-18 basis points which I mentioned and ex-gas deflation of minus-4 basis points. Now the core merchandise component of gross margin again was higher by 101 basis points year-over-year and 82 basis points higher ex-gas deflation, similar to last quarter and even more dramatic of an impact during this quarter, we had a significant sales shift from ancillary and other businesses to the core. This resulted in a higher contribution of our total gross margin dollars coming from the core operations versus last year.  Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation to only their own sales, so core-on-core if you will, margins year-over-year were up by 70 basis points. Fresh foods was the biggest driver up here with a strong sales in fresh we benefited from efficiency gains in both labor productivity and significantly lower what we call D-and-D or damage and destroyed or product spoilage. Food and sundries, softlines, hardlines as well as fresh - as a mentor fresh foods already, but in addition food and sundries, softlines and hardlines all had higher margins year-over-year in the quarter as well.  Ancillary and other businesses gross margin again was lower by 66 basis points and 71 basis points ex-gas deflation. Most of our ancillary businesses were lower year-over-year with a most significant negative impact coming from gasoline and travel, which accounted for about three quarters of the decline.  Costco logistics, which was primarily our acquisition this past March of The big-and-bulky last-mile carrier called Innovel.\u201d That was our newly acquired businesses. That impacted ancillary margins by minus-8 basis points. Again, we acquired this, this past March and we anticipated losses in this business as it ramps up. Note that these losses are not taking into account any added sales or expanded product offerings, lower delivered prices and improve member satisfaction.  Next, 2% reward, nothing really to say there, minus-2 basis points ex-gas deflation. In other, the minus-13 basis points, nearly all of this is attributable to the costs from COVID, $64 million of the $281 million previously mentioned. These are direct costs for incremental wages and sanitation allocated to our cost departments and to our merchandize fulfillment operations, so it impacts cost of sales.  Moving to SG&A. our reported SG&A percentage year-over-year was lower or better by 47 basis points coming in at 9.62% of sales this year in the fourth quarter versus 10.09% last year in the fourth quarter. Ex-gas deflation SG&A was lower or better by 66 basis points. Again, if we jot down the following two columns of numbers, first column is reported year-over-year SG&A change, and the second column would be ex-gas deflation.  Core operations as reported were better or lower by 42 basis points and ex-gas deflation lower or better by 57 basis points, so plus-42 and plus-57. Central plus-1 and plus-3; stock compensation plus-3 and plus-4, other plus-1 and plus-2 and that gives you the total on a reported basis SG&A being better by 47 basis points and ex-gas inflation being better by 66.  SG&A in the core excluding COVID related expenses which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment was significantly leveraged of course with a strong core of merchandise sales increases. As I mentioned, central, stock compensation showing small improvements year-over-year as a percent of sales and now the other plus-1 and plus-1 basis point and reported in a plus-2 ex-gas deflation. As I discussed earlier in the call the quarter was positively impacted by an $84 million reversal of last year's fourth quarter, a $123 million pre-tax reserve related to a product tax assessment taking a year ago in the fourth quarter.  The net impact from this item was plus-43 basis points. That plus-43 basis points is in this plus-1 and plus-2 basis point number. Also included in other are the incremental COVID costs or $217 million of the $281 million total amount. That equates to 42 basis or 41 basis points without gas deflation offsetting it the other way, so that's why you have that very small number in that line. Again, these are the costs for incremental wages and safety and sanitation.  Next on the income statement, pre-opening expense. That pre-opening expense last year in the fourth quarter was $41 million, this year in the fourth quarter was $15 million less coming in at $26 million. Last year in the fourth quarter we had 12 gross openings, 10 net and two relos, and that compares to 10 openings gross or 8 net in the fourth quarter this year. The big difference in those two numbers, this year's fourth quarter relates primarily to warehouses opened during the quarter, as well as warehouses scheduled to open in the first quarter. Last year's pre-opening included $12 million in pre-opening expenses related to our new \u2013 our then new poultry complex.  All total reported operating income in Q4 increased 32%, coming in at $1.929 billion this year compared to $1.463 billion last year and it would be a slightly higher percent increase if you excluded the items that I had mentioned earlier.  Below the operating income line, interest expense was higher year-over-year by $6 million coming in at $51 million this year compared to $45 million last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was lower by $83 million year-over-year. As discussed earlier, following the completion of the debt offering we pre-paid $1.5 billion of debt during the quarter. There was a pretext expense of \u2013 or what's known as a make-all payment of $36 million related to the early retirement of that debt, that's in this interest income and other line.  Actual interest income was lower by $28 million. It was actually lower by $28 million year-over-year in the quarter due principally to lower interest rates being realized. And lastly FX and other was lower by $19 million.  Overall reported pre-tax income in the fourth quarter was up. It came in higher by 25%, coming in at $1.869 billion this year compared to $1.492 billion last year. Again, these exclude those items I point \u2013 that's including those items I pointed out earlier. In terms of the income tax rate, our tax rate in Q4 of \u201820 was 24.9%, a little lower than a year ago when it was at 25.7% in the fourth quarter a year ago, so a little benefit there.  A few other items \u2013 a few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, with COVID we had some delays in some of the planned openings for the fiscal year that just ended this past August 30 and a few of those have been pushed into this year, that we are in now. For the year we opened 16 total units including three relos. So last year we opened a net increase of 13 locations. Our plans for this year is to open about 20 net, 23 including the 3 relos, that's our best guess and plan at this point, and as of Q4 end our total warehouse square footage stood at 116 million square feet.  In terms of capital expenditures, for the 16 week fourth quarter we spent approximately $852 million and the full year we spent $2.8 billion. Our estimated CapEx for all of fiscal \u201921 is in the $3 billion to $3.2 billion range.  E-commerce: overall our e-commerce sales as you\u2019ve seen each month have increased nicely. For the fourth quarter on a reported basis up 90.6% and ex-FX 91.3% increase during the fourth quarter. A few of the stronger deployments and there's several, health and beauty aids, food and sundries, appliances, TV's, computers and tablets, housewares and small electrics.  Total online grocery grew at a very strong rate in Q4, several 100%. This e-commerce comp if you will, the e-commerce numbers I just mentioned above follow our usual convention which we exclude the third party same day grocery program. If we included that third party same day our e-commerce comps result would have been approximately 120% up during the quarter.  Overall our e-com sites were relatively smoothly during the quarter despite the dramatic volume increases and we were able to improve our delivery times throughout - delivery times throughout the quarter as we adjusted to the ramped-up order volumes.  Now, quickly turning to COVID and the coronavirus and some of the issues and impacts surrounding it. From a sales perspective as indicated by our past three monthly sales releases, we've enjoyed strong sales results during the June, July and August time frame. Certainly these \u2013 the sale strength starts with our being deemed essential, resulting in strong sales of fresh foods and foods and sundries and health and beauty aids and the like. We've also benefited from the much improved sales and products and items for the home, outside of the food area.  As people are spending less on travel, air and hotel and dining out, they seem to have redirected some of those dollars to categories like lawn and garden, furniture and mattresses, exercise equipment, bicycles, housewares, cookware, plastics [ph] and the like. And lastly, a few of our ancillary businesses, notably our optical and hearing aid operations were closed for 12 to 16 weeks and reopened during the mid-summer.  From a supply chain perspective, kind of 40,000 foot view, in terms of China, at least judging by the shipments to us, most of the factories are up and running. There are still some production challenges due to certain components downstream in the supply chain, in areas like electronics, computer and certain white goods. It is getting better and improving each week, and like us so we feel that our suppliers\u2019 factories have gotten better over the last several months of instituting safety protocols, that's our best guess. India in terms of getting back to normal, each week is showing improvement and catching up, still a little behind. Food and sundries, some limits on paper goods are getting better. Toughest area overall is still sanitizing wipes, as well as latex gloves. In terms of other PP&E, we are in pretty good shape selling quite a bit of masks and the like. Milk and butter, things like that are generally okay.  In terms of fresh foods, proteins are currently all pretty good. There had been some slowdowns over the past few months and some allocations and some limits that we had to put on some of the sales in those items, but that's gotten back to normal at this point. Seafood and produce, all good as it has generally been throughout.  In terms of holiday merchandise planning; Halloween, a few \u2013 a small reduction in the amount of costumes. Some more basic candy items, as well as for Christmas going a little more basic in some areas and as well as looking at things, the needs and uses for the house. But viewing and given our strength of late, relatively optimistically.  And Costco Travel has shown some very modest improvement, but still significantly impacted during the quarter due to reduce demand. We do see our remember starting to book travel again, although generally further out than we have historically seen.  Our warehouses overall have remained open and are back to regular hours with additional hour on certain weekday mornings and many markets for seniors and persons with disabilities. The warehouses are still of course following the social distancing and sanitization guidelines and since May 4 as you know we've required all members and employees in the warehouse to wear masks.  Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results which is for the five weeks ending Sunday, October 4, on that following Wednesday, October 7th after market close.  With that, I will open it up to Q&A and give it back to Laurie. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And your first question is from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimeon Gutman : Hi everyone. Hey Richard, my first question is how should we think about or how you are planning COVID costs for Q1 of the next fiscal year? And if I'm not mistaken, I thought that for this fourth quarter there was a range \u2013 I don't know if there was a range, but we were expecting them to be lower sequentially and I think they were pretty similar. So you mentioned the basics what it constituted, but can you talk about why? \nRichard Galanti: Sure, as you may recall, on our first quarter conference call we indicated that such types of costs in the Q4 would be at least $100 million or over $100 million and of course $281 million is over $100 million, but quite a bit larger. But the reality is, the biggest factor is we chose to continue at least for the time being the $2 an hour premium. That represents about $14 million a week.  To-date, we are doing that and we've committed to doing that at least through, I believe the first eight weeks of fiscal \u2013 of this fiscal quarter, and again, we'll take that time and again. Our numbers have been very good, our employees are on the frontline, and so that \u2013 mind you, the fourth quarter was a 16-week quarter versus Q3, which is a 12-week quarter. So on a per week basis, it\u2019s come down. There\u2019s other things that have been, that won\u2019t be repeated in the first quarter at least. If you go back to the very beginning of time, for the first four to five weeks when we stopped doing food samples, we employed those third party employees ourselves. We paid our third party to have them help us in the warehouse, that was during those three to four weeks of craziness in late February through mid to late March when people were coming in and hoarding and what have you and that helped quite a bit.  So there's some costs that I don't expect to be continued. The biggest component of course would be the $2 premium and we'll see. At this juncture, we\u2019ve committed to our employees for the first 8 weeks of this quarter. \nSimeon Gutman : Okay, thanks for that. My follow-up, as you mentioned the holiday and I think you said, you're looking at it optimistically or favorable for now. Can you talk about, maybe a little more detail why? It seems like the results speak for themselves for now, but there could be a lot of change over the next couple of months, and has your customer diversified their basket with you know and you know you think you'll be able to retain them across more categories and keep trips as more retail gets their traffic back? Thanks. \nRichard Galanti: Sure. Well look, I mean the main data points that we look at is how strong things have been in the last 3.5 months, 4 months. You know June, July and August sales results which we've all shared with you guys. The trend in traffic has improved, so it's been positive the last couple of months instead of slightly or even more than slightly negative, going back to April and May, while the average ticket or average basket sizes continue to be relatively strong, so \u2013 and then probably if you ask what are some of the biggest surprises that we've had looking at the last three months of sales results compared to what we had expected a few months before that. I mean the big surprise is we expected you know fresh and food and sundries and paper goods and the like and health and beauty aids to be strong, particularly food because of the weakness, you know people dining out. But I think we're a little surprised by the strength in many of these discretionary, non-food categories, things for the house and big-ticket items.  Again, not only furniture for that inside the house, but patio furniture; live goods were particularly strong. Where in some instances we had tried to cut back a few orders back in March and April for seasonal summer goods like patio furniture. Very quickly we were having to scramble for more of those.  And so, so far so good. We recognized that people who are coming into Costco, we believe they feel safe given the safety protocols and the mask requirements. The sheer size of the building itself and the width of the aisles, so all of those things have helped us in that regard.  We are also back to after a couple months of not having our traditional multi-vendor mailer, you know coupon type of offerings, because several key items were limited or on allocation. We\u2019ve gotten back to that, and so I think our \u2013 at least our most recent three-plus-month history has given us some comfort at this point. Now as soon as I say that, things may change, but you know at this juncture we feel very good about how it\u2019ll be \u2013 what it looks like going forward. Recognizing, looking at some of these things with the more basic in terms of Halloween and Christmas and the like. \nOperator: Your next question is from Chris Horvers from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nChris Horvers: Thanks. Good evening guys. So my first question is, you know what's driving that strong core-on-core margin outside of the fresh category, which you know clearly would benefit from a shrink perspective. Is it sell-through and low clearance? Is it mix within the categories or is it something else? \nRichard Galanti: Well, on fresh, it\u2019s all the above. I mean its strong sales on a relatively higher initial margin business within our small confines of margin range. But then you know two components across the sales and fresh is labor productivity and spoilage. We don't have spoilage, we sell out, not literally but almost literally to the piece on these and things, and so you're not throwing stuff away, there is \u2013 it\u2019s a great business from a gross margin dollar perspective given the sales strength in it. So that\u2019s clearly the biggest thing.  But again, if you look at the other three core areas, core-on-core, food and sundries, hardlines and softlines, they're all up. But up you know a nice amount but nothing like fresh foods, so that\u2019s helped.  Now mind you, other things have offset that and the sum of all those things is still a positive. The things that have offset it would be things like the fact that certain ancillary businesses which are higher margin businesses were closed for 12 to 16 week period. Our food court of course has been limited of what we do there. We took out all the tables, we\u2019ve limited the product offerings. Travel which is, you know while a small business is an extreme an example of high margin, many items in travel is just a brokerage fee, almost sales minus no-cost of sales equal gross margin if you will, is the markup or the commission on some of that stuff, a portion of that. So you know those things have calmed down, but the sum of all those negatives are outweighed by the overall strength and core merchandise sales and pharmacy, pharmacy\u2019s been relatively strong too. Within that, fresh has been the biggest driver of it. \nChris Horvers: Got it. So a final question on that. You were surprised by the negative gas impact and ancillary. I mean you're peers, while not the same quarter saw tailwinds for the periods that crossed over, and so can you talk about how much of that 66 basis points is specifically gas versus the other businesses and as you look forward, you know considering that opticals open and food courts at least with a smaller menu open and starting to see some traction around travel and gas prices being stable. Do you expect that at this point that ancillary headwind could abate? \nRichard Galanti: I think it will be less negative, but I think it\u2019s going to be around for a while. I mean if you look at gas, gas is more profitable per dollar, per gallon of sales than it was a couple of years ago. Because I think the prices have come down, traditional retailer has not been as competitive, which allows us to be more competitive, but still make a little more.  At our trough, at the lowest point, I'm guessing back in April and May, there was a week where our gallons were down close to half. Today they're down closer to maybe down 10%, you know maybe 5% to 15% depending on the day of the week. But you know in normal times for the last few years pre-COVID, when the U.S. gasoline industry had comps in the very low single digits, we'd be in the very, very high single digits or close to 10% or 11% even sometimes.  So things have changed there. It\u2019s still a profitable business, but when your price per gallon goes down 20%, 30% and your and gallons are down even some small amount, and it\u2019s a 10% plus percent of sales of our business, it has that effect on it. At the end of the day, the sum of all this has still been quite good for us. \nChris Horvers: And could you break out that 66, that\u2019s specifically related to gas? \nRichard Galanti: No, when we said three quarters of it, it was gas and travel, that\u2019s as good as we get here. I don\u2019t have the detail in front of me. My guess is gas is more of it than travel, but they're both impactful. \nChris Horvers: Your guess is better than mine. Thanks very much. \nOperator: And your next question is from Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett; your line is open.\nChuck Grom: Hey, good afternoon. I\u2019m curious Richard, how you are thinking about the recovery of your gasoline business, particularly from a gallons perspective. And then I guess how this interplay is holding back the traffic into your stores. It\u2019s clearly getting better, but you know being impacted a little bit by the gas business. \nRichard Galanti: Well, I don't know exactly. I haven't seen numbers in the last week or two, but I believe our call it 10% negative gallon comp is still way better than the U.S. as a whole \u2013 the U.S. gasoline industry as a whole. And so, but you know we\u2019d rather have plus-10 to minus-10.  The fact is that people are coming in less, but they are buying more each time and the sum of those two things as we've shown here, we used to enjoy a 5% to 8% comps pre-COVID on a regular basis and the last three months we've enjoyed 14% if you will. And so overall we'll take that, but it\u2019s got to be a small impact still. \nChuck Grom: Okay and then just, it\u2019s been a while since I asked it, but the crossover between our customers that purchase gas and then and shop in the store at unlike times, hours. Do you have the number handy? \nRichard Galanti: I haven't seen it lately, but historically it has been for - during the hours that the warehouse itself was opened, the gas station is opened a couple hours perhaps on the other side of that, it\u2019s in the low 50s.\nChuck Grom: Low 50s, okay great. And then just switching gears a little bit, on capital allocation, you ended the year with over $30 per share in cash and cash equivalents and you obviously remain significantly under lever. Curious how you and the border are approaching this high class problem? \nRichard Galanti: Well, we have our regular quarterly board meeting in a couple of weeks, we'll see. But at the end of day, we talk about it every board meeting, all the different alternatives. Certainly we \u2013 when we went out to borrow the $4 billion, which was really a net increase of $2.5 billion because we used $1.5 billion to pay off existing debt. The fact was, it\u2019s that we're planning for a worst case scenario where we would be more \u2013 there'd be a seasonal summer merchandise that we might have to hold for a year, as well as there\u2019d be a lower inventory turn particularly on discretionary non-food categories.  Up until June when we\u2019ve seen the numbers really go in the northern way, you know June, July and August, much of that need has not occurred. So yes, we are in a good position right now, we\u2019ll continue to look at it, but you'll know this after we know. \nChuck Grom: Got it. Thanks a lot. \nOperator: Your next question is from Karen Short of Barclays. Your line is open.\nKaren Short: Hi, thanks very much. I guess first question was just on the $2 premium. I guess the real question is, I mean I know you called out the eight weeks, but would it be more prudent as we kind of model this to just kind of think that that's more or less the new norm, meaning $14 million a week is kind of what we should add on, on an ongoing basis. It just seems that, it's hard to take something like that away once you've offered it. But just thought on that? \nRichard Galanti: I don't think it\u2019s completely hard to take away. We communicate via our COO and our Head of HR to our employees. We've done that and we've continued to extended, but saying this will be it, and then we\u2019ve added a little more. Well, I think we\u2019ll see. I think something will \u2013 I think its may be hard but not impossible and we want to make sure we communicate to our employees of why we're doing it and we'll just have to wait and see Karen. \nKaren Short: Okay, and then I wanted to just\u2026 \nRichard Galanti: I certainly budgeted it in for the full fiscal year, but we don't know at this point. \nKaren Short: Okay, and then\u2026 \nRichard Galanti: We know at least eight of the 12 weeks in Q2 and maybe more. \nKaren Short: Okay, and then just back to traffic for a second. So within your reported traffic numbers, is obviously e-com rate. So I wanted to just ask a little about what your physical in-store traffic looks like and then I think on the last call you were asked on color on traffic with you're more loyal executive members versus you know the lower level members. Do you have any \u2013 do you have any color on both of those?\nRichard Galanti: I'm, looking real quick. I really, I don't I don't have color in terms of. Generally, and the executive members do everything, spend more, come in more frequently, buy more each time and renew at a higher rate.  I\u2019m looking real quick here, hold on. I don't have traffic. Comps \u2013 within our comp number, e-commerce benefits it by a little over 3% of the comp, yeah and not the traffic number. \nKaren Short: Okay.\nA - Richard Galanti: And the average ring has more than doubled. I\u2019m sorry, the average rate on e-com versus the warehouse is about twice and that\u2019s because you got a lot, and still even though we\u2019ve expanded on food and sundries and apparel, you still got big ticket items like electronics and furniture, exercise equipment and the like. Bob here is saying, he's guessing that the traffic impact would be one to two, but we don't how that's broken out. \nOperator: And your next question is from Michael Lasser form UBS. Your line is open.\nMichael Lasser: Thanks a lot for taking my question. So Richard now that we\u2019re six months into the pandemic, does cost still come out of this situation in a better position to experience incremental margin expansion over time, and is there any factor that you\u2019ve learnt that will allow the company to generate more margin expansion that would otherwise. \nRichard Galanti: Well, the more margin we can generate, the more likely we're going to give some of that back. In this case arguably given our strength, we've certainly given it back, but we\u2019ve remained very competitive, but we\u2019ve also maintained that $2 premium to our employees, which we appreciate. The first part of your question, when you started asking about, how do we feel we're going to come out of the pandemic and as thing change; I mean look there's factors as people eat out more and go out more or travel more, there's less for the home, you know that's on a macro basis.  We have to believe here and we do believe that we have picked up new members, we've picked up sales from existing members, from categories that they are buying more at Costco now relatively speaking in-part, because certain other venues or traditional venues are either closed or not frequented as often. So again, we\u2019ve been blessed in that regard.  I think the other thing that I\u2019ve witnessed over the last several months is our merchants ability to pivot and to add items for the \u2013 houseware items, additional items and so I think net of all those things, I still think on a macro basis when people start eating out more and start flying more and attending \u2013 you know going on vacations, some of these monies are now being used for purchasing things for the home is going to move that way.  That being said, I think there\u2019s several areas where we\u2019re retaining more of their dollars and some portion of that will continue to retain when it gets back to normal. \nMichael Lasser: Okay, and an on an unrelated note, when you look at commerce growth, what percentage of your membership is currently buying from you online, with the profile of the member who is driving the growth? And presumably a lot of the spend is incremental, because the spend of those members is going up. So does that change how you are thinking about emphasizing or investing behind your e-commerce business? \nRichard Galanti: Yeah, I don't have all those specifics. What I know is, what was happening even before COVID and has been exacerbated in a positive way since COVID is more some members have signed up to utilize those services. More members are utilizing those services and spending more on it.  If you think about the one day fresh, it is up several 100% fold recognizing it was a smaller base, even as its gone down from its peak couple three months ago, it's still a lot higher than it was before, and my guess is even as people get used to wanting to go out, there are some people right now that aren\u2019t going to the supermarket or aren\u2019t going out to shop, or to Costco to shop, they love the service.  There are some people that are going \u2013 there\u2019s going to be some group that is going to like that, and given our quality and value you know we and the supermarket are not mutually exclusive of one another and we think we'll keep some of that. So we are certainly doing more to market to members not only in store promotions, but online promotions as well.  Yeah, we feel \u2013 I feel better about our offerings today certainly than a year ago or two years ago, recognizing there\u2019s a lot of low hanging fruit because of some of the things we had done historically.  We know that on the \u2013 I hate to use the phase again, but on the big-and-bulky side, a lot of those things \u2013 you know for four years we had talked, which is pre-COVID, we had talked about going from $50 million in white goods sales in store in the U.S. with a limited sales penetration if you will, to fiscal \u201819 doing almost $700 million, I think just under $700 million.  That business has increased at a more rapid pace in the last year for two reasons, COVID and many people buying things for the home, as well as in our view the rigid old things we are seeing trends wise in terms of how to utilize, better utilize our big-and-bulky Innovel acquisition what we call now, what we now call Costco Logistics for big-ticket furniture items, lawn and garden items, exercise equipment and a like. \nMichael Lasser: Okay, thank you very much and good luck. \nRichard Galanti: Thanks. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Paul Lejuez of Citi; your line is open.\nPaul Lejuez : Hey guys, Paul Lejuez. Richard, can you maybe talk about what you're seeing in terms of spending by new customers relative to existing customers, but also relative to what you would typically see from a new customer. And then second, I guess I'm curious if you looked at club usage by members at all? You know what percent of your members used the club this quarter versus last quarter anyway to frame that? Thanks. \nRichard Galanti: I don\u2019t know if I can answer all those specifically, but keep in mind, some of our new members signed up simply for same day fresh or two day dry. Same day fresh, you have to be within a market trade area where there's a Costco. Two day dry, you can be anywhere, I think almost anywhere in the United States and with Instacart it\u2019s both United States and a good part of Canada now. And so we have some members, if they weren\u2019t a member, but they are signing up just to get two day dry and they're not near a Costco, need to say they\u2019re just buying those types of basic dry grocery items and that's it.  Generally speaking, what we\u2019ve seen in any given number, whatever type of member, they buy more each year over the first few years of their membership, and then there's the age thing as well. The sweet spot for us is still 40 to 55 year olds as they've grown economically, grown family wise and are not on the downside of that curve in terms of empty nesting and what have you, but I don't have any specifics beyond that to give you. \nPaul Lejuez : How about club usage?\nA - Richard Galanti: Club usage, same thing. Again, I can tell you, I don't have anything specific, like you know the last few months, but club other than traffic has improved greatly from its trough five months ago, not back to where it was you know pre-COVID. But one of the things that we see is is that the typical member over the first three to five years is growing their total purchases, which is a combination of their basket and their frequency. And clearly when we can convert somebody to an executive member, they are buying more and shopping more frequently than that. \nPaul Lejuez : Got it, thank you. Good luck! \nOperator: Your next question is from Oliver Chen of Cowen; your line is open.\nOliver Chen: Hi, think you. Richard, on the e-commerce frontier it's been really impressive what you've done. What is some of the lower hanging fruit that you see had there, and also if you could brief us on the penetration now and how you might see that step change and where that will head in the future?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I mean the main lower penetration things are if you go back three or four years ago, I don't think we had good email addresses for much more than a third of our member base, we didn't focus on that kind of stuff. Today we have well over 60% and growing.  We now require you when you sign up \u2013 and more members are signing up online, than in store in general anyway. When you sign-up, you sign-up with an email address. So we\u2019re doing a lot more to collect and gather those email addresses and then communicating with them more often, so that's probably the single biggest low hanging fruit. The other thing is we feel that we've been able to use you know emails if you will not only to drive e-commerce special promotions, but also in-store special promotions, as well the COVID, you know we were pleasantly surprised by just a sheer increase and people using same day fresh. You know anecdotally I can\u2019t tell you how many people have mentioned to me how they love it and that means they may very well be shopping same day fresh or same day whatever from their local supermarket as well. But we've got a lot of great items on there and it's hitting a cord. \nOliver Chen: And Richard, as we look to this holiday season, which is definitely like no other, what factors would you prioritize as how you're planning it as best you can differently this year versus others, and is the multi-vendor mailer in good shape and are you going to leverage that a lot for holiday as well. Would love your thoughts around dynamics of supply chain and marketing for holiday. \nA - Richard Galanti: Well, the multi-vendor mailer is back and you know there may be a few items that we don't have because of certain supply limitations, but for the most part it\u2019s completely back after I think two or three of those or six or nine weeks of multi-vendor mailers if you will that we didn't do. I think the biggest difference is again for the Christmas holidays, is getting back to the basics, but you're still going to see some hot, exciting items at Costco.  The \u2013 again as I mentioned, even on Halloween we still have costumes. I think we brought in something like 80% of what we would have normally brought in, 80% or 90% and we're actually selling them. So we added some vendors over the last several months given certain shortages.  You know one of the challenge is right now, we've had great numbers in electronics and white goods, not restating the fact that the numbers would be better if there was greater supply. We all read about their service supply issues on laptops and computers and things like that, on some of the gaming things on some of the white goods you know where there might be downstream shortage or at least some allocation of compressors. So we're doing very well on that. We've added some different vendors in some cases and I think the fact that we did so well this summer relative to what we had anticipated has given us the confidence to be still pretty aggressive going into the fall. \nOliver Chen: Our last question, on same day fresh and the momentum there, what are the margins like and what are your thoughts about that margin and the take rate and also taking some of those capabilities in-house versus using the white label?\nA - Richard Galanti: Well, at this juncture we have a very good relationship, who with other competitors I'm sure having a good relationship also with Instacart. There\u2019s a few other smaller ones that we're using. We're not necessarily looking to take that in-house at this juncture, but we are always looking at various third parties and we have good existing relationships and we want to keep growing those as well. \nOliver Chen: Thank you. Best regards. \nA - Richard Galanti: Thanks. \nOperator: Your next question is from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners; your line is open. \nJohn Heinbockel : Hey Richard, so there are a couple of things in gross. Even if you take out fresh food right, it looks like the other three were up quite a bit. Maybe you know dive into a little bit similarities driving those three of the categories versus what might be unique to each and then how sustainable is that right, because this is probably for the better core-on-cores we've seen in a while. \nRichard Galanti: Sure. Well look, first and foremost there's a \u2013 well, I guess two things. There's a little bit less promotional activity going on. If you think about TV's and electronics, those have been such a strong category, not just for Costco, but in general. The manufacturers haven't been doing as many promotional things.  So \u2013 and the other thing is is, given just this year\u2019s sales strength, you know when you're comping \u2013 you know if we comp to the, whatever it was in August 14, I don\u2019t have it in front of me or whatever, but in some of these categories that we\u2019re talking about where we're stronger, you're talking you know comps in the low to high 20\u2019s. When you got those, that kind of sales strength, you have very little \u2013 on a much smaller scale you have less markdowns.  So you got a \u2013 whatever your regular margin is on those categories, less, a little bit less. You know without a little bit of an offset from end of cycle or \u2013 and some of those cycles are 60 and 90 days by the away on some of those skews, so that\u2019s helped here a little bit. \nJohn Heinbockel : And then on ancillary right, you said 75% was gas and travel. Was gas the bulk of that and if so, and is gas more of the compare last year versus any decision you made right to take less margin. I imagine it's not that to take less margin and try to drive traffic. This market\u2019s just not there, right. \nA - Richard Galanti: You know, I think in terms of less margin, that's more of our DNA. You know when things are really good we're going to drive sales even further and do that or when things are good we're going to you know \u2013 we feel a little more comfortable doing that $2 an hour for another month, whatever it might be. But at the end of the day there's probably less price competition out there today than there was a year ago and so we\u2019re able to maintain our fair margins. \nJohn Heinbockel : Alright, and then lastly, what's the current thought process on two things: expanded both as, well what you happen to want to do for cost reasons and a third tier of membership. I don\u2019t know if it would be a higher tier or a middle tier, but you know sort of segmenting that a little more. \nA - Richard Galanti: Yeah, well on Buy Online and Pickup In Store, we continue to look at what others do, we continue to scratch our head a little bit. It's not that we\u2019ll never do it, but it's not on the agenda for this week. And as it relates to an additional tier of membership, again I don't think that's on the top of the priority play at this juncture given everything else that\u2019s going on. \nJohn Heinbockel : Okay, thanks. \nOperator: Your next question is from Scott Mushkin of R5 Capital; your line is open.\nScott Mushkin: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. So I guess I want to get back Richard to the e-commerce, the traffic mix and you know comments that you\u2019ve made prior about really wanting to get people into the club. As the pandemic shifts that, where you\u2019re going to see permanently traffic being an issue there, you know how are we supposed to \u2013 how are you thinking about like impulse purchases and just a classical model once we exit the pandemic if this kind of sticks with omnichannel just being a much bigger piece of the pie overall?\nRichard Galanti: Well, you know first of all keep in mind, if our online business was 5%-ish a year ago and now it's 8%-ish, that's a big delta in one year and it'll continue \u2013 it will probably continue to increase as a percentage from there, and that excludes the third party Instacart type business, yeah the one day grocery.  So you know look, we've been pretty good at pivoting along the way, and we recognize there's lots of attributes to value. The first and foremost is the lowest price on the greatest quality or quantity of goods and services and the trust that we've endeared with our members. I think that we'll figure that out as we go along. We're not \u2013 we maybe occasionally stubborn on something, but we're not completely intransient if we see we need to do something. We figure out how to do things in a little different way than others and we\u2019ll continue to do that. \nScott Mushkin: And as far as the pickup, I think you were quoted in a recent article on this. I mean how are you thinking about pickup over time and you know is there a way to bring that to \u2013 you know bring that arrow into what you guys are doing without \u2013 at better economics. I know you\u2019ve always been cautious about those economics. \nA - Richard Galanti: Well, keep in mind, when third parties do it, their cost for picking, we believe we don't know exactly what they are, but we believe based on our wages and benefits is less and they've created a model that works with their density and everything else. They are not just buying and delivering from Costco; they're buying and delivering to others, so there's some economics in that model that makes sense.  Our view also is there\u2019s some retailers that are doing it because they feel they have to. You know one of things, the article that you're talking about is the article today. The one in my view, the thing I would disagree in the article is we should be concerned because our sales have started slowing, which is the contrary. They're stronger than they've ever been in the last three months. So you know we don't have our head in the sand on it. We look at it. We have people here that study it and maybe we'll surprise you one day, but at this juncture we're not prepared to do that. \nScott Mushkin: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it. \nOperator: Your next question is from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer; your line is open. \nRupesh Parikh : Good evening! Thanks for taking my questions. I guess just two related questions on real estate. So as you look at your store growth for this year, what\u2019s the split between international and domestic? And also just given some of the challenges of brick and mortar, I'm also just curious if you're starting to see more opportunities on the real-estate front? \nA - Richard Galanti: Yeah, I mean I think our general view is that we still feel that \u2013 we want to open looking at this year into next five years, open somewhere between 20 and 25 a year net new units. About half of those, a little more than half will start by coming in the United States and that'll trend over the five years to maybe being slightly over 50/50 in the U.S. to slightly under 50/50 in the U.S. We still think we have plenty of opportunities in the U.S.  It does take longer in certain other countries. I think we're just about ready to do a second unit in France. We just opened our third unit in Spain after having opened our first unit in Spain, Gosh! Five years ago. We have one unit in China with two planned for fiscal \u201922; we're now in fiscal \u201921, and so some of these countries do take longer, but we are also putting a little bit more emphasis on that, where we've been successful or where we think we can be successful and \u2013 but I think you know again, at the 40,000 foot level, if we did 20 to 25, a little more than half in the first couple years is U.S. and by year four, five or six It\u2019ll probably be you know a set of 60/40 or 55/45 U.S. and will turn to be just the opposite. \nRupesh Parikh : Great! Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question is from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital; your line is open. \nScot Ciccarelli : Thank you. Hi guys! Actually another store growth question. What is the limiting factor for you in terms of accelerating your store grow further? Like you\u2019ve got you know a grand total of one in France and grand total of one in Spain right, and you've been there for five years. Like it just seems to me like there could be a lot more store expansion if you really wanted to push it and I guess what I'm wondering is, you know what keeps you from accelerating that further? \nA - Richard Galanti: I think there are a couple of things. First of all, I've always said that we're a very hands-on company and one of the things we\u2019ve learned when we've gone a little too fast, not to suggest one in five years is too fast, it is not, but you know I remember in Japan we got to 10 or 12 locations and then in about an 18 month period we opened eight or nine and we had a little bit of operating indigestion. As it relates to France, it took us close to 10 years to get our first open. The level of people and entities that can appeal that process and fight you to keep you out is unbelievable, and again, in Spain we actually have three, the fourth this year.  Generally speaking, if I were to look at various countries, we\u2019d open five in the first five years and that would be relatively fast for us, and \u2013 but again it gets back to I think getting that hands-on and make sure that we feel comfortable, how that market is doing. We're probably a little slower than we could be, but we feel good about it. It\u2019s worked for us, then we\u2019ll I think continue to do that. \nScot Ciccarelli : So Richard, that\u2019s on the international front and that makes sense. You got to get comfortable with the market and supply chain of course, but what about just in the U.S. Like you're obviously comfortable with all the, you know how to navigate kind of store openings and you know what are the kind of restrictions you might have. You know it just seems to me like if you've got a decent amount of white space. \nA - Richard Galanti: Fair enough. Well, I think some of the white space gets better each year. If I look at even the Seattle market, you know there was a multi-year period where we didn't open any additional units and then we opened on the east side here at Redmond and a couple of others, and part of it is cannibalizing nearby units. But no, we try to be relatively methodical and disciplined of kind of the returns that a new unit can generate, net of cannibalization, and could we open 20 instead of 12 or 13 in the U.S.? Absolutely. But it's how fast the real-estate people or the regional operations people get with our CEO to go through that process and finding the right properties, yeah. \nScot Ciccarelli : Got it. Okay, thanks a lot guys. \nOperator: Your next question is from Mike Baker of D.A. Davidson; your line is open. \nMike Baker : Hi! Thanks guys and it\u2019s getting late, so I'll be quick. But I wanted to ask you about the membership fee income up about five and change I think this quarter, which has been pretty consistent throughout the year. But I guess how much of that you think is from new members that you're picking up because of the pandemic. Some of your competitors are seeing you know big increases in new members from the pandemic. It's hard to tease that out from your numbers. I mean if you compare this \u2013 we can compare it to past MFI numbers, but it's a little lumpy because of the fee increases. So any idea of what you're picking up in terms of new members because of the pandemic?\nRichard Galanti: We don't disclose that. It\u2019s still a smaller percentage of the total, it\u2019s not a majority of the total. \nMike Baker : And does it surprise you that those membership numbers aren't accelerating more as you might see from some of your competitors? \nA - Richard Galanti: You know, our view when we look at some of our competitors numbers is partly because they have a much lower number of members per location than we do, and that's our view. But the fact is when we look at how penetrated we are in so many of our markets, I mean we are even in California where we have 120, 130 units, I forget how many units we got there. I believe we're north of 60, slightly north of 60% member household market share, in states like Oregon and Washington where we\u2019re well in excess of that. So I think that's part of the issue in our view. We've got a lot of people already. \nMike Baker : Right yeah, yeah, makes sense. Alright if I could ask one follow-up on gas gallons sold, you said you were at 10% today, that\u2019s not at 10% for the quarter, down 10% that is, I believe right at that sort of point in time. Did you mention how your gas gallons sold were for the \u2013 as we go through the whole quarter. \nRichard Galanti: We did not, that is definitely a more recent number in the last month let\u2019s say. I mentioned it may have been even in the end of Q3, which ended like May 10 or May whatever around them, where we were like a minus-50. But my guess is we are somewhere in the low to mid-teens for the last month. \nMike Baker : For the last quarter or for the last month. \nRichard Galanti: The last month, low teens. \nMike Baker : Okay, and so the total quarter is somewhere between those numbers presumably. \nRichard Galanti: Yes, yes. \nMike Baker : Got it! Great, got it, understood. Thank you. \nOperator: Yeah your next question is from Peter Benedict of Baird. Your lines open. \nPeter Benedict: Yeah, hey Richard. Just a question on how the product shortages issues that you guys have seen around COVID might be influencing your view on where you might go next in terms of vertical sourcing. I mean I don't assume there's anything electronics or white goods, but has the experience of the last four or five months, maybe set the curve in terms of when certain initiatives might be pulled forward? \nRichard Galanti: Well, yeah in terms of vertical initiatives, we've got \u2013 you know the last two or three years have been quite a bit, not only a bakery commissary that serves U.S. and Canada, just across the Canadian border, not only a second meat plant in Illinois versus the one we've had for many years in California, not only the poultry complex, and not only a couple of smaller produce initiatives we've got going on right now. And last but not even expected, but the acquisition of Innovel or what we now call Costco Logistics.  So we\u2019ve got our hands full with a lot of things right now. I don\u2019t necessarily see \u2013 I think one of the things that we\u2019ve learnt from COVID, we have great relationships with large companies, both consumer product name companies and private label name companies doing literally multi hundreds of millions of dollars of one item.  When there's been some shortage of supply, we've had to expand that vendor network a little bit. There is some instances where given our sheer volume in Asia now can we find a comparable manufacture or existing supplier that wants to do something over there. So I think there's be some ways to continue to reduce costs on key items, but in terms of what's the next big vertical, I don't know if we know at this point. \nPeter Benedict: Okay, no that\u2019s fair and just lastly on the travel bookings you had mentioned. You were starting to see a pick up there, but it's further out the normal. Can you frame maybe what's normal and what you're kind of seeing now? I thought that was interesting. \nRichard Galanti: This is my definition of what I understood previously at normal, is if you go back pre-COVID you know the majority of your booking is each day related to stuff for the next few months, may be a little further out for you know five months before Christmas or five months before the beginning of summer. Today you've got people booking things out five and nine months in some cases.  Now there's two reasons; one there is some great deals out there and two, in many instances there's no cancellation charges. And so we'll have to wait and see and part of that will be dictated by \u2013 you know we\u2019ve actually sold and have had some members go one some cruise of late, still a very small number.  The car rental business has picked up a little bit better than the other, but still down relative to what it had been pre-COVID. \nPeter Benedict: Great! Thanks so much.\nRichard Galanti: Overall \u2013 and mind you, if we book something out nine months, we don't take it into revenue until the trip is taken. So even though business has improved, in terms of what we show in our numbers, there's very little \u2013 it's just starting to \u2013 first of all it\u2019s not negative right now. You know there were a few months there in April, May, June or April, May certainly where cancellation costs were greater than trips being taken. \nPeter Benedict: Alright, makes sense. Alright, thanks Richard. \nOperator: Your next question is from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital. Your line is open.\nKelly Bania: Hi Richard, thanks for taking our question. Just wanted to ask maybe a two part question here. More and more retailers are talking a little bit about advertising, maybe as a way to offset their lower margin e-commerce business and so I was curious; one, if you could talk about where are e-com margins just with all the acceleration and maybe just also remind us what bucket that is in your table. But then also just philosophically how do you think about that, maybe taking on any more ad-revenue to your dot.com business? Thank you. \nRichard Galanti: Well, we're taking on more ad revenue and we keep learning more about that as well as we drive that business. But overall the margins \u2013 as lower gross margins, part of that is category specific, you know electronics which is by far the largest single component of e-commerce is a high single digit margin. If you think about it, in the Costco warehouse you've got fresh that\u2019s in the low double digits, you know sometimes a pre-teen or early-teen and you've got again conversely electronics, which is you know it mid to high.  You also, as we try to drive the business in certain new categories like apparel, where you know buy two items and get $5 off of whatever the marketing or promotional item is, there is a low realized margin on a given category and some of those categories versus in store.  So overall you also have less SG&A and I\u2019d get back to what Costco is always been at top line company. We are looking to grow the top line. Certainly the profitability of e-commerce has improved dramatically in the last year with these strong sales, but its part of the ecosystem.  Where is it in the matrix? It\u2019s an ancillary. \nKelly Bania: It is an ancillary, okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question is from Laura Champine of Loop Capital; your line is open. \nLaura Champine: Just a quick one, Richard. You\u2019ve managed to improve inventory turns or grow inventory slower than sales since the onset of COVID. I know that some of this has been supply chain issues or issues with certain skew sourcing, but that seems to be clearing up. How long can you keep improving inventory turns at this pace?\nRichard Galanti: Well, if we keep doing 14% sales for a while, but I\u2019d say that tongue-in-cheek, because if you go back to April and May, the inventory turns had come down and one of the reasons we are planning for additional capital, working capital needs.  Look, I think we\u2019ve gotten to a point when we\u2019ve enjoyed a turn based on how you calculated in the 12% to 13% range. When you get up to that range, it\u2019s difficult to some extent as well. Gas helps it, because we turn the gas every day; fresh foods helps it, because we turn fresh foods every week or less. I think about every week, maybe a little better than that. And the fact that we didn\u2019t have a big denigration on non-food items, which we had thought would be an offset to that, so it\u2019s helped it a little bit right now. But if you ask me if I could just keep where we are right now, I\u2019d say sure.\nLaura Champine: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Christopher Mandeville of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBlake Anderson: Hi, this is Blake on for Chris. Thanks for squeezing us in here. I was wondering if you comment at all on the extent to \u2013 you know how much of your existing customers you had before the pandemic that historically didn\u2019t buy general merchandise, that are now shopping that category. How much of that example have you seen?\nRichard Galanti: Yeah, I don\u2019t know of the top of my head that, sorry.\nBlake Anderson: Okay. And then just lastly, can you talk about renewal rates and your expectations on those? Should we expect them to maybe creep higher given all the comp strengths you\u2019re seeing now?\nRichard Galanti: Yeah, sorry, you\u2019re 0 for two. No, we don\u2019t guide. There are things that help the comp, that help the renewal rate, getting people to executive, getting people to do our credit card. Some of the things we do now when you sign-up online, auto bill, and so those are things that help push it upward a little bit.  Yeah, the fact to the extent, but conversely, if we ramped up internationally and not that we are going to do that overnight, but if we ramped up internationally, you start in any new market, the first few warehouses in a new country, you work on a much lower renewal rate to start with, but a much higher number of initial sign-ups, because there\u2019s lot of lookie-loo\u2019s. And so all those things weigh in, we feel so far that you know \u2013 I know as soon as we show a minus tenth of a percent in a quarter, which is knock on wood, we haven\u2019t of late, people worry what\u2019s going on. But our view is that we\u2019re hanging onto our members, we\u2019re getting them to \u2013 where in most countries, even in new countries we\u2019ve seen the trend to more often improve than not and so I think we feel pretty good about that.\nBlake Anderson: Got it! Thanks so much.\nRichard Galanti: Why don\u2019t we take two more questions.\nOperator: Yes. Your next question is from Greg Melich of Evercore ISI; your line is open.\nGreg Melich: Alright. Richard, just one clarification and one question. Did you say e-commerce was 8% and then over 10% including Instacart? Was that for the year or the quarter?\nRichard Galanti: Quarter and roughly.\nGreg Melich: 8%-ish and 10%-ish, got it. And then\u2026\nRichard Galanti: Yes-ish.\nGreg Melich: So on traffic, I guess that was my follow-up. You talked a lot about and it\u2019s nice to see the U.S. traffic come back through the quarter. Could you help us understand why international traffic remains negative and if there is any outlier countries driving that or is really the U.S. the outlier with traffic come back, and if you\u2019re concerned that that could influence the renewal rates in those international markets? Thanks.\nRichard Galanti: Well no, Canada is the outlier internationally. Mind you, if U.S. is a little over 70% of our company\u2019s sales, Canada is around 10%, 15%, I\u2019m sorry 15%. And so you\u2019ve got other international being less than...  Yeah, there have been more restrictions in Canada. Australia also there have been more lockdowns of late, but in Canada and we have no direct warehouse competition in Canada. We\u2019ve seen their traffic more negative with a basket even bigger than the U.S. So we are still kind of buying and we\u2019ve seen that improve also. It\u2019s that negative has been reduced, so hopefully that will continue as well. \nGreg Melich: Got it. \nRichard Galanti: Trend-wise, the last four months have been on the up and up.\nGreg Melich: Got it. So the trends are in the right direction, it\u2019s just taking longer for those country-specific reasons?\nRichard Galanti: It went further down to start with too. I mean I think even I\u2019m shooting from the hip here, but even several months ago if the U.S. was a minus-five traffic, Canada was a minus double-digit traffic.\nGreg Melich: Got it! Great, thanks a lot. Good luck.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you.\nOperator: And we have Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please ask your question. Your line is open.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks for having me on the call. I wanted to know if you\u2019re noticing any regional differences in terms of how consumers are behaving during the pandemic? Infection rates are rising in certain states and there is threat more. I don\u2019t know if they will fully go to lockdowns or not. But do you see any differences in terms of how they\u2019re getting ready for Halloween or worried about trigger treating or anything like that and how are you responding to that?\nRichard Galanti: I can\u2019t be specific, tell you specifically about Halloween. The only \u2013 if I look back over the last several months, the only thing that we saw was is when certain states unlocked more quickly, we saw a little pickup there faster, earlier, because people were getting out, getting out faster. Some of those states that did that. Other than that, we haven\u2019t seen anything dramatic. [Inaudible]  I mean Bob makes a good point here. I think and we are all guilty of it is, the pandemic has progressed, we are all hopefully. \nRichard Galanti: Hello? \nRobert Moskow: Yeah, we can hear you. \nRichard Galanti: You can hear me now. I thought I hung up on you, sorry. I think as the pandemic has continued, people have gotten a little more comfortable, hopefully still maintaining the safety protocols, but going out more often and that\u2019s helped us, the numbers pick up a little bit as well. And overall, again anecdotally we feel that people feel more comfortable coming into a place where masks are required, where the places, the physical spaces are larger with more cubic feet of open-air if you will. So I think those things have probably helped us. But the only real difference we saw was during those couple of months where some states opened up a little faster than others.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Does that mean, net-net, past re-openings eventually improved, that\u2019s a net positive for your business in 2021?\nRichard Galanti: Well, it\u2019s a net positive, but we don\u2019t know, does that also mean that if people eat out more frequently, they\u2019re going to buy less food, fresh food or food items at supermarkets and Costco. There\u2019s probably some different offsets there.  Again, we believe that some of the things that we\u2019ve picked up through this pandemic, in part because a lot of these non-food discretionary categories and big ticket categories, some of that\u2019s going to be sticky. And once they\u2019ve shopped and had a good experience at Costco at a great value, they\u2019ll hopefully continue that.\nRobert Moskow: Okay, thanks so much.\nA - Richard Galanti: Okay. Well, thank you everyone. Have a good day and we\u2019re around. Have a good day!\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "A - Richard Galanti",
            "content": "And the average ring has more than doubled. I'm sorry, the average rate on e-com versus the warehouse is about twice and that's because you got a lot, and still even though we've expanded on food and sundries and apparel, you still got big ticket items like electronics and furniture, exercise equipment and the like. Bob here is saying, he's guessing that the traffic impact would be one to two, but we don't how that's broken out. Club usage, same thing. Again, I can tell you, I don't have anything specific, like you know the last few months, but club other than traffic has improved greatly from its trough five months ago, not back to where it was you know pre-COVID. But one of the things that we see is is that the typical member over the first three to five years is growing their total purchases, which is a combination of their basket and their frequency. And clearly when we can convert somebody to an executive member, they are buying more and shopping more frequently than that. Well, the multi-vendor mailer is back and you know there may be a few items that we don't have because of certain supply limitations, but for the most part it's completely back after I think two or three of those or six or nine weeks of multi-vendor mailers if you will that we didn't do. I think the biggest difference is again for the Christmas holidays, is getting back to the basics, but you're still going to see some hot, exciting items at Costco.  The \u2013 again as I mentioned, even on Halloween we still have costumes. I think we brought in something like 80% of what we would have normally brought in, 80% or 90% and we're actually selling them. So we added some vendors over the last several months given certain shortages.  You know one of the challenge is right now, we've had great numbers in electronics and white goods, not restating the fact that the numbers would be better if there was greater supply. We all read about their service supply issues on laptops and computers and things like that, on some of the gaming things on some of the white goods you know where there might be downstream shortage or at least some allocation of compressors. So we're doing very well on that. We've added some different vendors in some cases and I think the fact that we did so well this summer relative to what we had anticipated has given us the confidence to be still pretty aggressive going into the fall. Well, at this juncture we have a very good relationship, who with other competitors I'm sure having a good relationship also with Instacart. There's a few other smaller ones that we're using. We're not necessarily looking to take that in-house at this juncture, but we are always looking at various third parties and we have good existing relationships and we want to keep growing those as well. Thanks. You know, I think in terms of less margin, that's more of our DNA. You know when things are really good we're going to drive sales even further and do that or when things are good we're going to you know \u2013 we feel a little more comfortable doing that $2 an hour for another month, whatever it might be. But at the end of the day there's probably less price competition out there today than there was a year ago and so we're able to maintain our fair margins. Yeah, well on Buy Online and Pickup In Store, we continue to look at what others do, we continue to scratch our head a little bit. It's not that we'll never do it, but it's not on the agenda for this week. And as it relates to an additional tier of membership, again I don't think that's on the top of the priority play at this juncture given everything else that's going on. Well, keep in mind, when third parties do it, their cost for picking, we believe we don't know exactly what they are, but we believe based on our wages and benefits is less and they've created a model that works with their density and everything else. They are not just buying and delivering from Costco; they're buying and delivering to others, so there's some economics in that model that makes sense.  Our view also is there's some retailers that are doing it because they feel they have to. You know one of things, the article that you're talking about is the article today. The one in my view, the thing I would disagree in the article is we should be concerned because our sales have started slowing, which is the contrary. They're stronger than they've ever been in the last three months. So you know we don't have our head in the sand on it. We look at it. We have people here that study it and maybe we'll surprise you one day, but at this juncture we're not prepared to do that. Yeah, I mean I think our general view is that we still feel that \u2013 we want to open looking at this year into next five years, open somewhere between 20 and 25 a year net new units. About half of those, a little more than half will start by coming in the United States and that'll trend over the five years to maybe being slightly over 50/50 in the U.S. to slightly under 50/50 in the U.S. We still think we have plenty of opportunities in the U.S.  It does take longer in certain other countries. I think we're just about ready to do a second unit in France. We just opened our third unit in Spain after having opened our first unit in Spain, Gosh! Five years ago. We have one unit in China with two planned for fiscal '22; we're now in fiscal '21, and so some of these countries do take longer, but we are also putting a little bit more emphasis on that, where we've been successful or where we think we can be successful and \u2013 but I think you know again, at the 40,000 foot level, if we did 20 to 25, a little more than half in the first couple years is U.S. and by year four, five or six It'll probably be you know a set of 60/40 or 55/45 U.S. and will turn to be just the opposite. I think there are a couple of things. First of all, I've always said that we're a very hands-on company and one of the things we've learned when we've gone a little too fast, not to suggest one in five years is too fast, it is not, but you know I remember in Japan we got to 10 or 12 locations and then in about an 18 month period we opened eight or nine and we had a little bit of operating indigestion. As it relates to France, it took us close to 10 years to get our first open. The level of people and entities that can appeal that process and fight you to keep you out is unbelievable, and again, in Spain we actually have three, the fourth this year.  Generally speaking, if I were to look at various countries, we'd open five in the first five years and that would be relatively fast for us, and \u2013 but again it gets back to I think getting that hands-on and make sure that we feel comfortable, how that market is doing. We're probably a little slower than we could be, but we feel good about it. It's worked for us, then we'll I think continue to do that. Fair enough. Well, I think some of the white space gets better each year. If I look at even the Seattle market, you know there was a multi-year period where we didn't open any additional units and then we opened on the east side here at Redmond and a couple of others, and part of it is cannibalizing nearby units. But no, we try to be relatively methodical and disciplined of kind of the returns that a new unit can generate, net of cannibalization, and could we open 20 instead of 12 or 13 in the U.S.? Absolutely. But it's how fast the real-estate people or the regional operations people get with our CEO to go through that process and finding the right properties, yeah. You know, our view when we look at some of our competitors numbers is partly because they have a much lower number of members per location than we do, and that's our view. But the fact is when we look at how penetrated we are in so many of our markets, I mean we are even in California where we have 120, 130 units, I forget how many units we got there. I believe we're north of 60, slightly north of 60% member household market share, in states like Oregon and Washington where we're well in excess of that. So I think that's part of the issue in our view. We've got a lot of people already. Okay. Well, thank you everyone. Have a good day and we're around. Have a good day!"

            "name": "Richard Galanti",
            "content": "Thank you, Laurie, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020, the 16 and 52 weeks ended August 30. Reported net income for the fourth quarter came in at $1.389 billion or $3.13 per diluted share as compared to $1.097 billion or $2.47 a share - per diluted share last year in the fourth quarter. This year's fourth quarter was negatively impacted by incremental expense related to COVID-19 premium wages and sanitation costs, totaling $281 million pretax or $0.47 a share, as well as a $36 million pre-tax charge or $0.06 per share related to early payment of $1.5 billion of debt.  These items were partially offset by an $84 million pre-tax benefit or $0.15 a share for the partial reversal of reserve of $123 million pretax, $0.22 per diluted share related to our product tax assessment taken in the fourth quarter of last year.  Net sales for the quarter increased 12.5% to $52.28 billion, up from $46.45 billion in the fourth quarter a year earlier. For the fiscal year in its entirety, fiscal 2020 came in at $163.22 billion, a 9.3% increase over the $149.35 billion in fiscal 2019.  Comparable sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 were as follows: On a reported basis for the 16 weeks the U.S. was 11%, excluding gas deflation and FX the U.S. was 13.6%. Canada reported 9.1% up, again ex-gas deflation FX 12.6% up. Other international reported 16.1%, ex-gas deflation in FX, 18.8%, bringing the total company to a reported number of 11.4% comp and again ex-gas deflation and FX up 14.1%. For the company, e-commerce reported was 90.6% up, and ex-gas and FX \u2013FX, 91.3% up.  In terms of the fourth quarter comp sales metrics, foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by about 50 basis points, and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 220 basis points.  Traffic or shopping frequency on a worldwide basis was down 1.2% during the fourth quarter and showed an increase of 1.2% in the U.S. Our average transaction or average basket size was up 12.7% during the fourth quarter, notwithstanding the negative impacts from gas deflation and FX which were included in that number.  We've kept you up-to-date in our monthly sales calls on the impacts from the pandemic as we've been able to identify those. Overall merchandise sales in the core, core being food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh, as well as pharmacy have all been strong, while sales in our ancillary, other ancillary, and travel businesses though now open have been soft.  Next, moving down the income statement, membership fee income. We reported a fourth quarter membership fee income of $1.106 billion, up $56 million from $1.05 billion in the fourth quarter of '19. The $56 million increase ex-FX would have been $60 million up.  During the quarter we opened eight net new units and 13 for the entire fiscal year. In terms of renewal rates, at fourth quarter end our U.S. and Canada renewal rate remained at 91.0% and worldwide rate also remained at its similar number from a quarter ago at 88.4%.  In terms of the number of members at Q4 end, both member households and card holders, total paid households at fourth quarter end was up \u2013 came in at 58.1 million and card holders 105.5 million.  In the fourth quarter, we standardized the membership count methodology globally, which we had apparently done differently in different markets, North America versus others, and so that increase includes that slight adjustment. The change resulted in adding approximately 1.3 million paid members and 2.0 million card holders to our member base.  So as an example, from Q3 to Q4 when we showed going from 55.8 million to 58.1 million or up 2.3 million, that 2.3 million increase includes the 1.3 million adjustment upwards. Similarly, the $3.7 million increase from the end of third quarter to fourth quarter, that 3.7 million increase includes 2.0 million of an adjustment. I'd like to note however that neither the membership fee income dollars nor the renewal rate calculations were affected by this adjustment. At fourth quarter end, paid executive memberships totaled 22.6 million, an increase of 765,000 during the 16 weeks since third quarter end.  Going down the gross margin line -- going down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin came in at 11.24%, up 18 basis points from last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 11.06%. That 18 basis point increase, excluding gas deflation came in \u2013 would have been minus 4 basis points and excluding a portion of the direct COVID expenses would have been up 8 and I'll show you that in the numbers that I ask you to jot down here.  If you jot down the following numbers, two columns: First column will be fourth quarter as reported, second column will be fourth quarter ex-gas deflation. The first line item would be core merchandise. Year-over-year on a reported basis, core merchandise was up 101 basis points, ex-gas deflation up 82 basis points, so plus 101 and plus 82 in the first line item.  Ancillary businesses being the second line item reported minus 66 basis points and without gas deflation minus 71. A 2% reward, minus-4 basis points and minus-2 basis points, other minus-13 basis points and minus-13 basis points and that would give you totals on a reported basis of plus-18 basis points which I mentioned and ex-gas deflation of minus-4 basis points. Now the core merchandise component of gross margin again was higher by 101 basis points year-over-year and 82 basis points higher ex-gas deflation, similar to last quarter and even more dramatic of an impact during this quarter, we had a significant sales shift from ancillary and other businesses to the core. This resulted in a higher contribution of our total gross margin dollars coming from the core operations versus last year.  Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation to only their own sales, so core-on-core if you will, margins year-over-year were up by 70 basis points. Fresh foods was the biggest driver up here with a strong sales in fresh we benefited from efficiency gains in both labor productivity and significantly lower what we call D-and-D or damage and destroyed or product spoilage. Food and sundries, softlines, hardlines as well as fresh - as a mentor fresh foods already, but in addition food and sundries, softlines and hardlines all had higher margins year-over-year in the quarter as well.  Ancillary and other businesses gross margin again was lower by 66 basis points and 71 basis points ex-gas deflation. Most of our ancillary businesses were lower year-over-year with a most significant negative impact coming from gasoline and travel, which accounted for about three quarters of the decline.  Costco logistics, which was primarily our acquisition this past March of The big-and-bulky last-mile carrier called Innovel.\u201d That was our newly acquired businesses. That impacted ancillary margins by minus-8 basis points. Again, we acquired this, this past March and we anticipated losses in this business as it ramps up. Note that these losses are not taking into account any added sales or expanded product offerings, lower delivered prices and improve member satisfaction.  Next, 2% reward, nothing really to say there, minus-2 basis points ex-gas deflation. In other, the minus-13 basis points, nearly all of this is attributable to the costs from COVID, $64 million of the $281 million previously mentioned. These are direct costs for incremental wages and sanitation allocated to our cost departments and to our merchandize fulfillment operations, so it impacts cost of sales.  Moving to SG&A. our reported SG&A percentage year-over-year was lower or better by 47 basis points coming in at 9.62% of sales this year in the fourth quarter versus 10.09% last year in the fourth quarter. Ex-gas deflation SG&A was lower or better by 66 basis points. Again, if we jot down the following two columns of numbers, first column is reported year-over-year SG&A change, and the second column would be ex-gas deflation.  Core operations as reported were better or lower by 42 basis points and ex-gas deflation lower or better by 57 basis points, so plus-42 and plus-57. Central plus-1 and plus-3; stock compensation plus-3 and plus-4, other plus-1 and plus-2 and that gives you the total on a reported basis SG&A being better by 47 basis points and ex-gas inflation being better by 66.  SG&A in the core excluding COVID related expenses which I'll discuss in a moment was significantly leveraged of course with a strong core of merchandise sales increases. As I mentioned, central, stock compensation showing small improvements year-over-year as a percent of sales and now the other plus-1 and plus-1 basis point and reported in a plus-2 ex-gas deflation. As I discussed earlier in the call the quarter was positively impacted by an $84 million reversal of last year's fourth quarter, a $123 million pre-tax reserve related to a product tax assessment taking a year ago in the fourth quarter.  The net impact from this item was plus-43 basis points. That plus-43 basis points is in this plus-1 and plus-2 basis point number. Also included in other are the incremental COVID costs or $217 million of the $281 million total amount. That equates to 42 basis or 41 basis points without gas deflation offsetting it the other way, so that's why you have that very small number in that line. Again, these are the costs for incremental wages and safety and sanitation.  Next on the income statement, pre-opening expense. That pre-opening expense last year in the fourth quarter was $41 million, this year in the fourth quarter was $15 million less coming in at $26 million. Last year in the fourth quarter we had 12 gross openings, 10 net and two relos, and that compares to 10 openings gross or 8 net in the fourth quarter this year. The big difference in those two numbers, this year's fourth quarter relates primarily to warehouses opened during the quarter, as well as warehouses scheduled to open in the first quarter. Last year's pre-opening included $12 million in pre-opening expenses related to our new \u2013 our then new poultry complex.  All total reported operating income in Q4 increased 32%, coming in at $1.929 billion this year compared to $1.463 billion last year and it would be a slightly higher percent increase if you excluded the items that I had mentioned earlier.  Below the operating income line, interest expense was higher year-over-year by $6 million coming in at $51 million this year compared to $45 million last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was lower by $83 million year-over-year. As discussed earlier, following the completion of the debt offering we pre-paid $1.5 billion of debt during the quarter. There was a pretext expense of \u2013 or what's known as a make-all payment of $36 million related to the early retirement of that debt, that's in this interest income and other line.  Actual interest income was lower by $28 million. It was actually lower by $28 million year-over-year in the quarter due principally to lower interest rates being realized. And lastly FX and other was lower by $19 million.  Overall reported pre-tax income in the fourth quarter was up. It came in higher by 25%, coming in at $1.869 billion this year compared to $1.492 billion last year. Again, these exclude those items I point \u2013 that's including those items I pointed out earlier. In terms of the income tax rate, our tax rate in Q4 of \u201820 was 24.9%, a little lower than a year ago when it was at 25.7% in the fourth quarter a year ago, so a little benefit there.  A few other items \u2013 a few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, with COVID we had some delays in some of the planned openings for the fiscal year that just ended this past August 30 and a few of those have been pushed into this year, that we are in now. For the year we opened 16 total units including three relos. So last year we opened a net increase of 13 locations. Our plans for this year is to open about 20 net, 23 including the 3 relos, that's our best guess and plan at this point, and as of Q4 end our total warehouse square footage stood at 116 million square feet.  In terms of capital expenditures, for the 16 week fourth quarter we spent approximately $852 million and the full year we spent $2.8 billion. Our estimated CapEx for all of fiscal '21 is in the $3 billion to $3.2 billion range.  E-commerce: overall our e-commerce sales as you've seen each month have increased nicely. For the fourth quarter on a reported basis up 90.6% and ex-FX 91.3% increase during the fourth quarter. A few of the stronger deployments and there's several, health and beauty aids, food and sundries, appliances, TV's, computers and tablets, housewares and small electrics.  Total online grocery grew at a very strong rate in Q4, several 100%. This e-commerce comp if you will, the e-commerce numbers I just mentioned above follow our usual convention which we exclude the third party same day grocery program. If we included that third party same day our e-commerce comps result would have been approximately 120% up during the quarter.  Overall our e-com sites were relatively smoothly during the quarter despite the dramatic volume increases and we were able to improve our delivery times throughout - delivery times throughout the quarter as we adjusted to the ramped-up order volumes.  Now, quickly turning to COVID and the coronavirus and some of the issues and impacts surrounding it. From a sales perspective as indicated by our past three monthly sales releases, we've enjoyed strong sales results during the June, July and August time frame. Certainly these \u2013 the sale strength starts with our being deemed essential, resulting in strong sales of fresh foods and foods and sundries and health and beauty aids and the like. We've also benefited from the much improved sales and products and items for the home, outside of the food area.  As people are spending less on travel, air and hotel and dining out, they seem to have redirected some of those dollars to categories like lawn and garden, furniture and mattresses, exercise equipment, bicycles, housewares, cookware, plastics [ph] and the like. And lastly, a few of our ancillary businesses, notably our optical and hearing aid operations were closed for 12 to 16 weeks and reopened during the mid-summer.  From a supply chain perspective, kind of 40,000 foot view, in terms of China, at least judging by the shipments to us, most of the factories are up and running. There are still some production challenges due to certain components downstream in the supply chain, in areas like electronics, computer and certain white goods. It is getting better and improving each week, and like us so we feel that our suppliers' factories have gotten better over the last several months of instituting safety protocols, that's our best guess. India in terms of getting back to normal, each week is showing improvement and catching up, still a little behind. Food and sundries, some limits on paper goods are getting better. Toughest area overall is still sanitizing wipes, as well as latex gloves. In terms of other PP&E, we are in pretty good shape selling quite a bit of masks and the like. Milk and butter, things like that are generally okay.  In terms of fresh foods, proteins are currently all pretty good. There had been some slowdowns over the past few months and some allocations and some limits that we had to put on some of the sales in those items, but that's gotten back to normal at this point. Seafood and produce, all good as it has generally been throughout.  In terms of holiday merchandise planning; Halloween, a few \u2013 a small reduction in the amount of costumes. Some more basic candy items, as well as for Christmas going a little more basic in some areas and as well as looking at things, the needs and uses for the house. But viewing and given our strength of late, relatively optimistically.  And Costco Travel has shown some very modest improvement, but still significantly impacted during the quarter due to reduce demand. We do see our remember starting to book travel again, although generally further out than we have historically seen.  Our warehouses overall have remained open and are back to regular hours with additional hour on certain weekday mornings and many markets for seniors and persons with disabilities. The warehouses are still of course following the social distancing and sanitization guidelines and since May 4 as you know we've required all members and employees in the warehouse to wear masks.  Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results which is for the five weeks ending Sunday, October 4, on that following Wednesday, October 7th after market close.  With that, I will open it up to Q&A and give it back to Laurie. Thank you. Sure, as you may recall, on our first quarter conference call we indicated that such types of costs in the Q4 would be at least $100 million or over $100 million and of course $281 million is over $100 million, but quite a bit larger. But the reality is, the biggest factor is we chose to continue at least for the time being the $2 an hour premium. That represents about $14 million a week.  To-date, we are doing that and we've committed to doing that at least through, I believe the first eight weeks of fiscal \u2013 of this fiscal quarter, and again, we'll take that time and again. Our numbers have been very good, our employees are on the frontline, and so that \u2013 mind you, the fourth quarter was a 16-week quarter versus Q3, which is a 12-week quarter. So on a per week basis, it's come down. There's other things that have been, that won't be repeated in the first quarter at least. If you go back to the very beginning of time, for the first four to five weeks when we stopped doing food samples, we employed those third party employees ourselves. We paid our third party to have them help us in the warehouse, that was during those three to four weeks of craziness in late February through mid to late March when people were coming in and hoarding and what have you and that helped quite a bit.  So there's some costs that I don't expect to be continued. The biggest component of course would be the $2 premium and we'll see. At this juncture, we've committed to our employees for the first 8 weeks of this quarter. Sure. Well look, I mean the main data points that we look at is how strong things have been in the last 3.5 months, 4 months. You know June, July and August sales results which we've all shared with you guys. The trend in traffic has improved, so it's been positive the last couple of months instead of slightly or even more than slightly negative, going back to April and May, while the average ticket or average basket sizes continue to be relatively strong, so \u2013 and then probably if you ask what are some of the biggest surprises that we've had looking at the last three months of sales results compared to what we had expected a few months before that. I mean the big surprise is we expected you know fresh and food and sundries and paper goods and the like and health and beauty aids to be strong, particularly food because of the weakness, you know people dining out. But I think we're a little surprised by the strength in many of these discretionary, non-food categories, things for the house and big-ticket items.  Again, not only furniture for that inside the house, but patio furniture; live goods were particularly strong. Where in some instances we had tried to cut back a few orders back in March and April for seasonal summer goods like patio furniture. Very quickly we were having to scramble for more of those.  And so, so far so good. We recognized that people who are coming into Costco, we believe they feel safe given the safety protocols and the mask requirements. The sheer size of the building itself and the width of the aisles, so all of those things have helped us in that regard.  We are also back to after a couple months of not having our traditional multi-vendor mailer, you know coupon type of offerings, because several key items were limited or on allocation. We've gotten back to that, and so I think our \u2013 at least our most recent three-plus-month history has given us some comfort at this point. Now as soon as I say that, things may change, but you know at this juncture we feel very good about how it'll be \u2013 what it looks like going forward. Recognizing, looking at some of these things with the more basic in terms of Halloween and Christmas and the like. Well, on fresh, it's all the above. I mean its strong sales on a relatively higher initial margin business within our small confines of margin range. But then you know two components across the sales and fresh is labor productivity and spoilage. We don't have spoilage, we sell out, not literally but almost literally to the piece on these and things, and so you're not throwing stuff away, there is \u2013 it's a great business from a gross margin dollar perspective given the sales strength in it. So that's clearly the biggest thing.  But again, if you look at the other three core areas, core-on-core, food and sundries, hardlines and softlines, they're all up. But up you know a nice amount but nothing like fresh foods, so that's helped.  Now mind you, other things have offset that and the sum of all those things is still a positive. The things that have offset it would be things like the fact that certain ancillary businesses which are higher margin businesses were closed for 12 to 16 week period. Our food court of course has been limited of what we do there. We took out all the tables, we've limited the product offerings. Travel which is, you know while a small business is an extreme an example of high margin, many items in travel is just a brokerage fee, almost sales minus no-cost of sales equal gross margin if you will, is the markup or the commission on some of that stuff, a portion of that. So you know those things have calmed down, but the sum of all those negatives are outweighed by the overall strength and core merchandise sales and pharmacy, pharmacy's been relatively strong too. Within that, fresh has been the biggest driver of it. I think it will be less negative, but I think it's going to be around for a while. I mean if you look at gas, gas is more profitable per dollar, per gallon of sales than it was a couple of years ago. Because I think the prices have come down, traditional retailer has not been as competitive, which allows us to be more competitive, but still make a little more.  At our trough, at the lowest point, I'm guessing back in April and May, there was a week where our gallons were down close to half. Today they're down closer to maybe down 10%, you know maybe 5% to 15% depending on the day of the week. But you know in normal times for the last few years pre-COVID, when the U.S. gasoline industry had comps in the very low single digits, we'd be in the very, very high single digits or close to 10% or 11% even sometimes.  So things have changed there. It's still a profitable business, but when your price per gallon goes down 20%, 30% and your and gallons are down even some small amount, and it's a 10% plus percent of sales of our business, it has that effect on it. At the end of the day, the sum of all this has still been quite good for us. No, when we said three quarters of it, it was gas and travel, that's as good as we get here. I don't have the detail in front of me. My guess is gas is more of it than travel, but they're both impactful. Well, I don't know exactly. I haven't seen numbers in the last week or two, but I believe our call it 10% negative gallon comp is still way better than the U.S. as a whole \u2013 the U.S. gasoline industry as a whole. And so, but you know we'd rather have plus-10 to minus-10.  The fact is that people are coming in less, but they are buying more each time and the sum of those two things as we've shown here, we used to enjoy a 5% to 8% comps pre-COVID on a regular basis and the last three months we've enjoyed 14% if you will. And so overall we'll take that, but it's got to be a small impact still. I haven't seen it lately, but historically it has been for - during the hours that the warehouse itself was opened, the gas station is opened a couple hours perhaps on the other side of that, it's in the low 50s. Well, we have our regular quarterly board meeting in a couple of weeks, we'll see. But at the end of day, we talk about it every board meeting, all the different alternatives. Certainly we \u2013 when we went out to borrow the $4 billion, which was really a net increase of $2.5 billion because we used $1.5 billion to pay off existing debt. The fact was, it's that we're planning for a worst case scenario where we would be more \u2013 there'd be a seasonal summer merchandise that we might have to hold for a year, as well as there'd be a lower inventory turn particularly on discretionary non-food categories.  Up until June when we've seen the numbers really go in the northern way, you know June, July and August, much of that need has not occurred. So yes, we are in a good position right now, we'll continue to look at it, but you'll know this after we know. I don't think it's completely hard to take away. We communicate via our COO and our Head of HR to our employees. We've done that and we've continued to extended, but saying this will be it, and then we've added a little more. Well, I think we'll see. I think something will \u2013 I think its may be hard but not impossible and we want to make sure we communicate to our employees of why we're doing it and we'll just have to wait and see Karen. I certainly budgeted it in for the full fiscal year, but we don't know at this point. We know at least eight of the 12 weeks in Q2 and maybe more. I'm, looking real quick. I really, I don't I don't have color in terms of. Generally, and the executive members do everything, spend more, come in more frequently, buy more each time and renew at a higher rate.  I'm looking real quick here, hold on. I don't have traffic. Comps \u2013 within our comp number, e-commerce benefits it by a little over 3% of the comp, yeah and not the traffic number. Well, the more margin we can generate, the more likely we're going to give some of that back. In this case arguably given our strength, we've certainly given it back, but we've remained very competitive, but we've also maintained that $2 premium to our employees, which we appreciate. The first part of your question, when you started asking about, how do we feel we're going to come out of the pandemic and as thing change; I mean look there's factors as people eat out more and go out more or travel more, there's less for the home, you know that's on a macro basis.  We have to believe here and we do believe that we have picked up new members, we've picked up sales from existing members, from categories that they are buying more at Costco now relatively speaking in-part, because certain other venues or traditional venues are either closed or not frequented as often. So again, we've been blessed in that regard.  I think the other thing that I've witnessed over the last several months is our merchants ability to pivot and to add items for the \u2013 houseware items, additional items and so I think net of all those things, I still think on a macro basis when people start eating out more and start flying more and attending \u2013 you know going on vacations, some of these monies are now being used for purchasing things for the home is going to move that way.  That being said, I think there's several areas where we're retaining more of their dollars and some portion of that will continue to retain when it gets back to normal. Yeah, I don't have all those specifics. What I know is, what was happening even before COVID and has been exacerbated in a positive way since COVID is more some members have signed up to utilize those services. More members are utilizing those services and spending more on it.  If you think about the one day fresh, it is up several 100% fold recognizing it was a smaller base, even as its gone down from its peak couple three months ago, it's still a lot higher than it was before, and my guess is even as people get used to wanting to go out, there are some people right now that aren't going to the supermarket or aren't going out to shop, or to Costco to shop, they love the service.  There are some people that are going \u2013 there's going to be some group that is going to like that, and given our quality and value you know we and the supermarket are not mutually exclusive of one another and we think we'll keep some of that. So we are certainly doing more to market to members not only in store promotions, but online promotions as well.  Yeah, we feel \u2013 I feel better about our offerings today certainly than a year ago or two years ago, recognizing there's a lot of low hanging fruit because of some of the things we had done historically.  We know that on the \u2013 I hate to use the phase again, but on the big-and-bulky side, a lot of those things \u2013 you know for four years we had talked, which is pre-COVID, we had talked about going from $50 million in white goods sales in store in the U.S. with a limited sales penetration if you will, to fiscal \u201819 doing almost $700 million, I think just under $700 million.  That business has increased at a more rapid pace in the last year for two reasons, COVID and many people buying things for the home, as well as in our view the rigid old things we are seeing trends wise in terms of how to utilize, better utilize our big-and-bulky Innovel acquisition what we call now, what we now call Costco Logistics for big-ticket furniture items, lawn and garden items, exercise equipment and a like. Thanks. I don't know if I can answer all those specifically, but keep in mind, some of our new members signed up simply for same day fresh or two day dry. Same day fresh, you have to be within a market trade area where there's a Costco. Two day dry, you can be anywhere, I think almost anywhere in the United States and with Instacart it's both United States and a good part of Canada now. And so we have some members, if they weren't a member, but they are signing up just to get two day dry and they're not near a Costco, need to say they're just buying those types of basic dry grocery items and that's it.  Generally speaking, what we've seen in any given number, whatever type of member, they buy more each year over the first few years of their membership, and then there's the age thing as well. The sweet spot for us is still 40 to 55 year olds as they've grown economically, grown family wise and are not on the downside of that curve in terms of empty nesting and what have you, but I don't have any specifics beyond that to give you. Well, I mean the main lower penetration things are if you go back three or four years ago, I don't think we had good email addresses for much more than a third of our member base, we didn't focus on that kind of stuff. Today we have well over 60% and growing.  We now require you when you sign up \u2013 and more members are signing up online, than in store in general anyway. When you sign-up, you sign-up with an email address. So we're doing a lot more to collect and gather those email addresses and then communicating with them more often, so that's probably the single biggest low hanging fruit. The other thing is we feel that we've been able to use you know emails if you will not only to drive e-commerce special promotions, but also in-store special promotions, as well the COVID, you know we were pleasantly surprised by just a sheer increase and people using same day fresh. You know anecdotally I can't tell you how many people have mentioned to me how they love it and that means they may very well be shopping same day fresh or same day whatever from their local supermarket as well. But we've got a lot of great items on there and it's hitting a cord. Sure. Well look, first and foremost there's a \u2013 well, I guess two things. There's a little bit less promotional activity going on. If you think about TV's and electronics, those have been such a strong category, not just for Costco, but in general. The manufacturers haven't been doing as many promotional things.  So \u2013 and the other thing is is, given just this year's sales strength, you know when you're comping \u2013 you know if we comp to the, whatever it was in August 14, I don't have it in front of me or whatever, but in some of these categories that we're talking about where we're stronger, you're talking you know comps in the low to high 20's. When you got those, that kind of sales strength, you have very little \u2013 on a much smaller scale you have less markdowns.  So you got a \u2013 whatever your regular margin is on those categories, less, a little bit less. You know without a little bit of an offset from end of cycle or \u2013 and some of those cycles are 60 and 90 days by the away on some of those skews, so that's helped here a little bit. Well, you know first of all keep in mind, if our online business was 5%-ish a year ago and now it's 8%-ish, that's a big delta in one year and it'll continue \u2013 it will probably continue to increase as a percentage from there, and that excludes the third party Instacart type business, yeah the one day grocery.  So you know look, we've been pretty good at pivoting along the way, and we recognize there's lots of attributes to value. The first and foremost is the lowest price on the greatest quality or quantity of goods and services and the trust that we've endeared with our members. I think that we'll figure that out as we go along. We're not \u2013 we maybe occasionally stubborn on something, but we're not completely intransient if we see we need to do something. We figure out how to do things in a little different way than others and we'll continue to do that. We don't disclose that. It's still a smaller percentage of the total, it's not a majority of the total. We did not, that is definitely a more recent number in the last month let's say. I mentioned it may have been even in the end of Q3, which ended like May 10 or May whatever around them, where we were like a minus-50. But my guess is we are somewhere in the low to mid-teens for the last month. The last month, low teens. Yes, yes. Well, yeah in terms of vertical initiatives, we've got \u2013 you know the last two or three years have been quite a bit, not only a bakery commissary that serves U.S. and Canada, just across the Canadian border, not only a second meat plant in Illinois versus the one we've had for many years in California, not only the poultry complex, and not only a couple of smaller produce initiatives we've got going on right now. And last but not even expected, but the acquisition of Innovel or what we now call Costco Logistics.  So we've got our hands full with a lot of things right now. I don't necessarily see \u2013 I think one of the things that we've learnt from COVID, we have great relationships with large companies, both consumer product name companies and private label name companies doing literally multi hundreds of millions of dollars of one item.  When there's been some shortage of supply, we've had to expand that vendor network a little bit. There is some instances where given our sheer volume in Asia now can we find a comparable manufacture or existing supplier that wants to do something over there. So I think there's be some ways to continue to reduce costs on key items, but in terms of what's the next big vertical, I don't know if we know at this point. This is my definition of what I understood previously at normal, is if you go back pre-COVID you know the majority of your booking is each day related to stuff for the next few months, may be a little further out for you know five months before Christmas or five months before the beginning of summer. Today you've got people booking things out five and nine months in some cases.  Now there's two reasons; one there is some great deals out there and two, in many instances there's no cancellation charges. And so we'll have to wait and see and part of that will be dictated by \u2013 you know we've actually sold and have had some members go one some cruise of late, still a very small number.  The car rental business has picked up a little bit better than the other, but still down relative to what it had been pre-COVID. Overall \u2013 and mind you, if we book something out nine months, we don't take it into revenue until the trip is taken. So even though business has improved, in terms of what we show in our numbers, there's very little \u2013 it's just starting to \u2013 first of all it's not negative right now. You know there were a few months there in April, May, June or April, May certainly where cancellation costs were greater than trips being taken. Well, we're taking on more ad revenue and we keep learning more about that as well as we drive that business. But overall the margins \u2013 as lower gross margins, part of that is category specific, you know electronics which is by far the largest single component of e-commerce is a high single digit margin. If you think about it, in the Costco warehouse you've got fresh that's in the low double digits, you know sometimes a pre-teen or early-teen and you've got again conversely electronics, which is you know it mid to high.  You also, as we try to drive the business in certain new categories like apparel, where you know buy two items and get $5 off of whatever the marketing or promotional item is, there is a low realized margin on a given category and some of those categories versus in store.  So overall you also have less SG&A and I'd get back to what Costco is always been at top line company. We are looking to grow the top line. Certainly the profitability of e-commerce has improved dramatically in the last year with these strong sales, but its part of the ecosystem.  Where is it in the matrix? It's an ancillary. Well, if we keep doing 14% sales for a while, but I'd say that tongue-in-cheek, because if you go back to April and May, the inventory turns had come down and one of the reasons we are planning for additional capital, working capital needs.  Look, I think we've gotten to a point when we've enjoyed a turn based on how you calculated in the 12% to 13% range. When you get up to that range, it's difficult to some extent as well. Gas helps it, because we turn the gas every day; fresh foods helps it, because we turn fresh foods every week or less. I think about every week, maybe a little better than that. And the fact that we didn't have a big denigration on non-food items, which we had thought would be an offset to that, so it's helped it a little bit right now. But if you ask me if I could just keep where we are right now, I'd say sure. Yeah, I don't know of the top of my head that, sorry. Yeah, sorry, you're 0 for two. No, we don't guide. There are things that help the comp, that help the renewal rate, getting people to executive, getting people to do our credit card. Some of the things we do now when you sign-up online, auto bill, and so those are things that help push it upward a little bit.  Yeah, the fact to the extent, but conversely, if we ramped up internationally and not that we are going to do that overnight, but if we ramped up internationally, you start in any new market, the first few warehouses in a new country, you work on a much lower renewal rate to start with, but a much higher number of initial sign-ups, because there's lot of lookie-loo's. And so all those things weigh in, we feel so far that you know \u2013 I know as soon as we show a minus tenth of a percent in a quarter, which is knock on wood, we haven't of late, people worry what's going on. But our view is that we're hanging onto our members, we're getting them to \u2013 where in most countries, even in new countries we've seen the trend to more often improve than not and so I think we feel pretty good about that. Why don't we take two more questions. Quarter and roughly. Yes-ish. Well no, Canada is the outlier internationally. Mind you, if U.S. is a little over 70% of our company's sales, Canada is around 10%, 15%, I'm sorry 15%. And so you've got other international being less than...  Yeah, there have been more restrictions in Canada. Australia also there have been more lockdowns of late, but in Canada and we have no direct warehouse competition in Canada. We've seen their traffic more negative with a basket even bigger than the U.S. So we are still kind of buying and we've seen that improve also. It's that negative has been reduced, so hopefully that will continue as well. Trend-wise, the last four months have been on the up and up. It went further down to start with too. I mean I think even I'm shooting from the hip here, but even several months ago if the U.S. was a minus-five traffic, Canada was a minus double-digit traffic. Thank you. I can't be specific, tell you specifically about Halloween. The only \u2013 if I look back over the last several months, the only thing that we saw was is when certain states unlocked more quickly, we saw a little pickup there faster, earlier, because people were getting out, getting out faster. Some of those states that did that. Other than that, we haven't seen anything dramatic. [Inaudible]  I mean Bob makes a good point here. I think and we are all guilty of it is, the pandemic has progressed, we are all hopefully. Hello? You can hear me now. I thought I hung up on you, sorry. I think as the pandemic has continued, people have gotten a little more comfortable, hopefully still maintaining the safety protocols, but going out more often and that's helped us, the numbers pick up a little bit as well. And overall, again anecdotally we feel that people feel more comfortable coming into a place where masks are required, where the places, the physical spaces are larger with more cubic feet of open-air if you will. So I think those things have probably helped us. But the only real difference we saw was during those couple of months where some states opened up a little faster than others. Well, it's a net positive, but we don't know, does that also mean that if people eat out more frequently, they're going to buy less food, fresh food or food items at supermarkets and Costco. There's probably some different offsets there.  Again, we believe that some of the things that we've picked up through this pandemic, in part because a lot of these non-food discretionary categories and big ticket categories, some of that's going to be sticky. And once they've shopped and had a good experience at Costco at a great value, they'll hopefully continue that."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And please note that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. And I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO. Please go ahead, sir.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you Joseph and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the 12 weeks ended May 10. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $838 million or $1.89 per diluted share. This compared to $906 million or $2.05 per diluted share last year in the third quarter. Now, this year's third quarter was negatively impacted by direct expenses of $283 million pretax or $0.47 per diluted share from incremental wage, safety and sanitation costs related to COVID-19 and last year's third quarter number of $2.05 included the benefit from a nonrecurring tax item of $73 million or $0.16 per diluted share. Net sales for the quarter increased 7.3% to $36.45 billion, up from $33.96 billion last year in the third quarter. On a same-store comparable sales basis for the third quarter, for the 12 weeks on a reported basis, the U.S. was at 5.9%. Excluding gas deflation and FX impact, the 5.9% would have been for the 12 weeks an 8.0%. Canada on a reported basis was minus 2.5%, ex gas deflation and FX plus 3.0%. Other international came in on a reported basis at 6.2% and again ex gas deflation and FX, plus 12.2%. All told, the total company came in with a reported 4.8% and again ex gas deflation and FX, the 4.8% would have been 7.8%. I might also note that e-commerce on a reported basis was 64.5% comp and ex gas deflation or ex FX, 66.1%. Now foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 110 basis points and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 190 basis points for the total company therefore to 300 basis points. Additionally, gasoline volumes or gallons were down about 20% year-over-year in the quarter as a result of less driving due to the pandemic. The impact of gasoline gallons is not in the adjusted figures that I just described above. In terms of traffic, our shopping frequency decreased in the quarter worldwide by 4.1% and in the U.S. by 2.0%. Our average transaction or ticket was up 9.3% during the third quarter and the 9.3% does include the negative impacts from gas deflation and FX. Now, our third quarter comp sales figures did reflect also that a few of our businesses, notably optical, hearing aids and photo were closed for much of Q3 and a good portion of our food court item offerings were eliminated also for much of Q3 as well we eliminated the food court seating during this time. Reopenings of these began, the ones that were closed, began on April 30, 10 days prior to the third quarter end with about 20% of the locations back to operating by Q3 end. In the past two to three weeks, nearly all will be back in operation by mid-June. In terms of the food courts which have been open but again a much more limited menu, we have added some but not all the items back as of now. In all, an estimated hit to the reported sales numbers that we gave you earlier in Q3 by one to two percentage points by those items being closed or restricted. Next on the income statement. Membership fee income reported came in at $815 million or 2.24%, up 5% or $39 million from $776 million or 2.9% last year in Q3. Ex FX weakness, the $39 million increase and 5% increase would have been up $47 million or 6%. During the quarter, we had two new openings and a total of four year-to-date. In terms of renewal rates, at Q3 end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate came in at 91.0%, a tick up from where we were at Q2 end and the worldwide rate came in at 88.4%, the same as it was a fiscal quarter ago. Keep in mind that any impact on renewal rates from COVID, positive or negative, are reflected over the next several months. In terms the number of members at Q3 end, member households and cardholders. In terms of households, we ended the third quarter with 55.8 million households, up from 55.3 million 12 weeks earlier. And total cardholders came in at 101.8 million, up from 100.9 million 12 weeks earlier. At Q3 end, paid executive memberships came in at 21.8 million, an increase of 135,000 over the last 12 weeks. Going down to the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin was higher year-over-year by 54 basis points on a reported basis, coming in at 11.53%, up from 10.99%. Now, the 54, ex gas deflation would have been plus 33 basis points. As I usually do, I will ask you to write down a few numbers in two columns and then we will go through that explanation. In terms reported, in Q3 2020 year-over-year, the core merchandise was up 51 basis points on a reported basis and without gas deflation up 33. Ancillary businesses was on a reported basis plus 26 basis points, ex gas deflation plus 21. The 2% reward, minus six and minus four basis points. Other, minus 17 and minus 17. And you add up those two columns, total reported again up 54 basis points on a reported basis and up 33 basis points. And gross margin was up 33 basis points, ex-gas deflation. Now, the core merchandise component of gross margin again higher by 51 or 33 ex deflation. Keep in mind that in the quarter, we had a decent sales shift from ancillary and other businesses to core businesses which resulted in a higher contribution of our total gross margin dollars coming from the core. Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation to only their own sales or what we call core-on-core, margins year-over-year were lower by 17 basis points. Five basis points, by the way, which was losses related to our new poultry complex. This is something I have pointed out in the last two quarters and will probably do so next quarter as well. In total, pretty similar in fact to our year-over-year impact in Q2. So while higher penetration of our total sales came from the core this year, it was at a slightly lower gross margin percentage year-over-year. This is mostly attributed to sales mix, both between and within merchandise categories. Our fresh foods gross margin percentage was up, again despite any first-year headwinds from the ramp up process associated with poultry complex. The strength in fresh was a result of high sales, driving down our spoilage as well as labor costs as a percent of sales, being able to leverage those at a normal rate. Softlines, food and sundries and hardlines, all had lower margin percentage year-over-year in the quarter. One example, non-foods which is both hardlines and softlines. Non-foods was impacted by shift in sales towards lower margin departments, particularly things like majors and big-ticket electronics. Ancillary and other business gross margin in the two columns, higher by 26 basis points. And again, 21 higher basis points ex gas deflation. This result was primarily due to strength in gas and e-com gross margin dollars year-over-year, partially offset by lower penetration of ancillary sales due to lower gas prices and volumes and closures of some of those ancillary businesses that I talked about earlier. Several of those businesses have higher gross margins. 2% reward was higher or was a hit to gross margin by six basis points on a reported basis and four ex deflation, implying that slightly higher percentage of our sales were eligible for the executive member reward. The other line item, 17 basis points to the negative. 12 of the 17 basis points is attributable to the COVID costs and the 12 basis points, that's about $44 million of the $283 million number that was mentioned in the press release. These are the costs for incremental wages, safety and sanitation costs allocated to our cost departments and merchandise fulfillment operations. So it hits the margin. The other five basis points or $19.7 million came from accruing reserve for certain third-party gift cards and ticket programs. This latter $19.7 million was not included in the $283 million total amount that we called out as a direct incremental expenses from COVID. Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A percentage year-over-year was higher by 59 basis points, coming in at 10.51% of sales, up from 9.92%. Ex gas deflation, the minus 59 would have been minus 40 or higher by 40. If you would again please jot down the following SG&A components and then we will go through that. Core operations reported was plus nine or lower by nine, a benefit of nine. Ex gas deflation, plus 24 or a benefit of 24 basis points. Central was zero and plus two. Stock compensation, plus three and plus three. Other, minus 71 and minus 69. And you add up those two columns, you get to the reported SG&A increase of 59 basis points and ex gas and FX -- ex gas deflation, rather, minus 40 or by a higher by 40 basis points. Now again, the core operations component lower by nine and ex gas deflation lower by 24. SG&A in the core operations, that's excluding the COVID-related expenses that I will talk about in the minute, they were, needless to say, leveraged with strong core merchandise sales. Central was essentially flat and a slight improvement relative to the including the ex gas deflation. Stock comp, no surprises there. It was a slight benefit to SG&A by three basis points. And again the other component of 71 or 69 ex gas deflation, of the 71, 66 basis points of the 71 is attributable to the incremental costs of COVID-19 or $239 million of that $283 million total amount that was in the press release. Again these are the cost for incremental wages and safety and sanitation related to direct expenses. The balance of the 71 basis point figure was five basis points or $18.5 million, this came from the costs associated with the acquisition and integration-related expenses of our recent acquisition of Innovel, that last mile delivery and installation operation for big and bulky that we acquired a few months ago. Next on the income statement is pre-opening expense. Pre-opening expense was lower by $6 million, coming in at $8 million in the quarter versus $14 million a year ago. Again, we had two openings this year. Last year in the quarter, we had three. Although, chunks of each of these numbers relate to pending openings in Q4 as well. All told, reported operating income in the third quarter of 2020 increased by 5.1%, coming in at $1,179 million this year, compared to $1,122 million a year ago. Now this 5% increase is notwithstanding the incremental cost that I just talked about, the $283 million as well as the $19.7 million and the $18.5 million that I just mentioned as well. Those are all taken in the third quarter. Below the operating income line. Interest expense was higher year-over-year by $2 million coming in at $37 million this year in the quarter versus $35 million a year ago. Recall, that we completed a $4 billion debt offering on April 20 during the third quarter. Following the completion of the debt offering, we called the outstanding debt due May of 2021. That was a $1 billion tranche and an additional $5 million tranche that was due in February 2022. Both of these tranches, we have paid off this morning after a 30-day call notice. There will be a pretax expense of $36 million related to the earlier time and our make-whole of this debt which will hit our Q4 results on the interest income and other line in our P&L. Next on the income statement, interest income and other for the quarter. It was lower by $15 million year-over-year, mostly attributed to lower interest income and mostly attributed to lower interest rates within that. Overall, reported pretax income in Q3 of fiscal 2020 was up 3.6%, coming in at $1,163 million versus $1,123 million last year and again the $1,163 million is after taking the impacts of those charges that I previously mentioned. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q3 this year was 26.7%. Last year, it was 18.5% tax rate. Again, last year, it included a benefit of a nonrecurring tax item of $73 million. A few other items of note in terms of warehouse expansion. As I mentioned, we opened two units in the third quarter. That puts us at five, actually five units total through the first three quarters. We expect in Q4 to open 10 including two relos, so net of eight. So it looks like our net total this year will be somewhere around 13. There's been a few that have been impacted by COVID-19 in terms of construction delays and have been pushed into the first part of fiscal 2021 which starts in early September. As of Q3 end, total warehouse square footage stood at 115 million square feet. In terms of capital expenditures, the third quarter of fiscal 2020 total spend was approximately $626 million and our estimated CapEx for all of fiscal 2020 is currently in the $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion range, a slight decline from what where we had guesstimated and estimated a quarter ago. And again, I think that has to do with some of the delays in construction since this COVID issue. In terms of e-commerce. As I mentioned earlier, overall our e-commerce sales on a reported basis increased 64.5% and 66.1% ex FX. I should note that within that 61%, like many retailers out there, we saw an increasingly level of strength in e-commerce sales over the last few months. If I look through the 12 week, the three four-week periods that comprise our 12 week third quarter, roughly that 64.5% reported number in the first four weeks was in the 25% range, in the next four weeks in the 50% increased range and the most recent in the last four weeks in the 90% range, but totaling that 64.5% on a reported basis. A few of the stronger departments, health and beauty aids, office, majors, housewares and small electrics. Total online grocery grew at an incredible rate during the third quarter, as I am sure did at many places. The comp numbers just mentioned again follow, that's the 64% number, they follow our historical convention where we exclude our third-party or same-day grocery program since that comes into the warehouse to be picked up by the third-party and delivered to our member. If we were to include that third-party in our e-commerce number, that mid 60% comp number would be slightly over 100%. So we have seen big strength in driving the business that way. Overall, our e-com sites have worked pretty smoothly during the quarter despite dramatic volume increases and as well we were able to improve on delivery times throughout the quarter as we adjusted to the ramped up order volumes. Now turning to Coronavirus and all the issues and impacts surrounding it. From a sales perspective, as discussed last quarter and indicated by our monthly sales results that we do, we started Q3 strong. I think it started actually in the fourth week of February and then into the first two-and-half weeks of March with very strong sales as people were stocking up prior to the implementation, the concern about availability of certain key products as well as the implementation of various stay at home orders. The middle of the quarter was weaker as many of geographies in which we operate had issued mandates limiting movement as well we had implemented our own restrictions during these times. Recently our sales have started to recover somewhat as states have begun to relax restrictions. Within the merchandise categories, foods, fresh and other essentials have been very strong despite out of stocks on some items throughout the quarter such as toilet paper, paper towels, cleaning supplies, et cetera, meats and proteins toward the end of the quarter, hand sanitizers and the like. Office and majors were also strong during the quarter driven by work from home initiatives while most other discretionary categories were a little weaker during the quarter such as jewelry, luggage, third-party gift cards, they were generally weak. Other weak categories which include things like sporting goods, lawn and garden, patio and apparel, while they were weak, they have rebounded somewhat towards the end of the quarter. From a supply chain perspective, I am going to give you 40,000 foot view of that. On the nonfood side, as it relates to imports from China, most the factories are now up and running. Other major country suppliers, India for textiles and domestics, Mexico primarily for things like TV assembly, a few weeks behind China in terms of getting back to normal but each week is showing improvement. On the food and sundry sides, paper goods still on allocation and item limits on certain items in certain regions. Sporadic limits on canned food items like tuna and chicken. The toughest areas, again, are still hand sanitizers, disinfecting wipes and Lysol sprays and the like. Items like milk and butter are generally okay. And also, we have eliminated like frozen, certain frozen proteins like chicken and beef items. In terms of fresh, on the protein side, the merchandise is there but challenging from a production and processing side. Currently, for us, pork is the least affected but somewhat affected by what we have done for the last couple of three weeks, I believe. On fresh beef, chicken and pork items, those protein items, we limit three fresh items in total. We also have limits of one per SKU on certain frozen items like 10 pounds of hamburger patties or chicken breast and the like. In terms of seafood and produce, that's all good. And again, talking to our buyers in these categories, they are generally, again probably with the exception of the hand sanitizer because it's not just people who are hoarding it, a great increase in use and demand of those items continued. But we expect continued improvement generally each week. And lastly, Costco travel, it was obviously significantly impacted during the quarter due to reduced demand as well as cancellations of previously booked trips. Members are now starting to actually book travel again, although generally further out than we have historically seen and of course we book those results when the trips or activities occur. Warehouses have overall remained open, although we did operate at reduced hours at most of our U.S. locations for several weeks during the quarter. Regular hours resume May 4 with an additional hour on weekday mornings for seniors and persons with disabilities. Warehouses are still following social distancing and sanitizing guidelines. Additionally, as discussed, some of our warehouse businesses like hearing aid, optical and photo and to a partial extent, the food courts, were closed or mitigated during the majority of the quarter. Also effective May 4, we now require all members and employees in the warehouses to wear masks. During the quarter, including again that big $283 million number, we spent about $32 million on masks, gloves and incremental cleaning supplies and things like plexiglass partitions, you name it, all related to COVID. But that's in that $283 million number. Some of the initiatives related to the $283 million in costs will extend into Q4. We would expect the incremental expenses related to COVID, these types of expenses related to COVID to exceed $100 million in Q4 but it would be quite a bit lower than the $283 million that we had in Q3. We will have to just wait and see, though. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results for the four weeks ending this Sunday, May 31 next Wednesday, June 3 after market close. With that, I will open it up for Q&A and turn it back to Joseph. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We have our first question from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimeon Gutman: Hi Richard. I know we have to wait till we get the May result but I don't know how much you can preview us just given how dynamic the environment is in terms of the mix of products that's being sold, traffic to warehouse because the environment, now you are starting to see other states and stores open. Curious if there is anything you can call out as a preview for May?\nRichard Galanti: I really can't call anything as a preview. Some of the comments I made in this document as it relates to towards the end of the quarter, we saw certain things pick up. The fact that we went back recently to full hours, we are all better both us, our employees and our members are better getting through the warehouse. So seasonally, I think some of the items that were online has picked up that we talked about. But we will wait and see next week.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And then my follow-up on memberships. I think you said that ex FX, they were up 6%, if I caught that. Can you parse out U.S. in the quarter relative to that 6%, if that is the right number? And then anything that surprised you with regard to the pace of new members growth, the actual amount or anything geographic?\nRichard Galanti: Generally, no. But what we talked about way back when -- at the end of Q2 and the beginning of this quarter, we saw some pickup when there was a lot of you know, when we had these crazy strong numbers and people were coming in to buy all those essentials, short supply, high-demand and short supply items. We saw some additional sign-ups but not meaningful relative to our whole company in those weeks, towards the end of February and the first half of March. Other than that, I think the fact that the traffic is down a little bit but the average ticket is up, you have got some members that are coming in and bulking up a little more. And then you have some members that are not coming in as often. So that hits you a little bit but overall we think that we are in pretty good stead.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Can I just sneak in one more? I just want to --\nRichard Galanti: Yes. One other comment is that we have also seen a switch from walk-in sign-ups to online sign-ups. And that's good. When you sign-up online, I know you are also required to have auto bill which is a positive for renewal rates long term.\nSimeon Gutman: Yes. And then the last one is on e-commerce, the assortment, the SKU assortment. Any like strategic thinking that we should have a bigger assortment than you do? I think you are always adding but is there a rethink as far the total number of SKUs?\nRichard Galanti: I don't think necessarily. The only total increase is where we have gone to some additional suppliers in some very limited items. So we have expanded our supplier network in some limited cases. Beyond to that is more of a shift. It started with, if you will, some of the big and bulky items. And this started well before COVID, like white goods. And that's continuing and certainly the strength that we have had online, whether it's reported online through our two-day grocery or through e-commerce or certain third-party providers like Instacart and Shipt and others, all that stuff has driven some of the business from the warehouse to online. And again, I think, if I go back six, eight, 10 weeks ago, whatever the normal time to get something was, particularly like two-day grocery was well more than two days, we are back to two days. Same day, our third-party suppliers had challenges. They ramped up in the 200,000-plus new employees in a matter of weeks. That too has gotten a lot better in the last few weeks. So I hate to use the word strategic, we certainly know that big and bulky can be done very effectively online with a few displays in the warehouse as well but have that delivered and installed through online and that will continue. It probably has been expanded a little bit because of this people at home, things like exercise equipment and like big electronics and things.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Thanks Richard.\nOperator: We have our next question from Chris Horvers from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nChris Horvers: Thanks. Good evening. So a couple of question on the margin front. Can you talk about, break down the ancillary margins a little bit in terms of what you saw in terms of the benefit of gas versus the headwinds that you would see from mixing down in those other categories? And as you look ahead, given where you see gas prices are at this point, would you expect that benefit of gas, if prices held, to be higher in the current quarter?\nRichard Galanti: Well, you know, there was a perfect good storm in the last quarter as it relates to margins and gas. And I think there's, not even our information, but there's public information on strength in retailers that sell gasoline in terms of gross margins. So we certainly benefited from that. A little offset to that was a reduced number of gallons. But nonetheless, it was particularly strong and I think that's evidenced in the matrix. You have higher margins on some of those other ancillary businesses like optical and hearing aid. While small in size, there's a higher margin because we have to account for the additional cost of optometrist and hearing aid technicians and the like. And so, those types of things, gas being the biggest piece of it towards the other stuff but it all ends up there was net net good for us in the quarter.\nChris Horvers: And so was there any, did you have any impact in terms of like the apparel category? Did you have to take any markdowns? And as you look at ahead, how are you thinking about the potential risk of that category impacting? Are you seeing some rebound in that category and don't expect that to be a headwind in the next quarter?\nRichard Galanti: Fortunately, we haven't seen a lot of markdowns. Apparel, for us, is a pretty, there is a big part of it that's seasonal. And when this thing first started, we were able to talk to suppliers and work deals where in some cases certain things hadn't been made yet or they had the raw materials but they hadn't finished the product. So let's pay for part of the finished, for the raw materials but hold off until next season. We have held on. One of the reasons we went and borrowed money was looking at the worst case which, in our view, has not happened but what if we had a wholesome big volumes of seasonal stuff. We were going to, whatever commitments we had, we were going to respect. But I think, in combination of working with our vendors as well as sales have rebounded in those areas a little more than expected. It's not that people are coming in and going down every aisle. Some are just going getting their essentials and heading out of Dodge, but at the end of the day, I think as the weather has turned, we have been a little bit more, felt a little more good about things. Who knows what tomorrow brings, though.\nChris Horvers: Okay. And then just the last question also on gross margins. You mentioned that e-commerce was actually a benefit. Most retailers we have seen have a substantial headwind as e-commerce growth accelerated. But it didn't seem to occur here because -- so could you elaborate on that?\nRichard Galanti: Well, first of all, it's like I think everybody, for us, it's certainly a lower margin business as we tried to build it over time. It's really the gross margin dollars are stronger because of the huge sales volume. We are spending more money on it. And so probably, I don't have it in front of me, but as a percent of profit, as a percent of sales I am sure it is down a little bit and that's expected. But the total gross margin dollars are up, simply because of the sheer strength of it.\nChris Horvers: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: We have our next question from Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is open.\nMichael Lasser: Good evening, Thank you for the opportunity for asking my question. Richard, are you reaching an upper bound of your membership potential in the U.S. with the view that if a pandemic is not going to motivate a regular consumer to sign up for a membership, that it maybe hard for them to sign up under any scenario?\nRichard Galanti: Well, we certainly don't believe that. There is going to be two or three new normals over the next two or three years and probably not a real new normal and then with its own set of difficulties besides that. We are asked the question constantly. When I talk about this giant 10-plus fold increase in same-day grocery delivery, that's certainly because people, there is a group of people that don't want to go out. There's others that want to come in but they coming less frequently and buy more each time. There's going to be some new normals. Our guess is that whatever it's gotten to is not going to necessarily, maybe there is a back down a little bit at some point, but still be higher than it was the day before all this? Sure. But who knows? That's something that we talk about every day around here. And I think over time, there's been a lot of questions and we are happy with our renewal rates and we are all going to have get past this. One of things that we and some others, what I will call the big essential retailers, we have all been fortunate that we been open. And when you talk to people, anecdotally they feel frankly more comfortable coming into a Costco which is bigger, more wide open certainly the six feet apart that we are all doing, with the mask requirements. There are a few people that don't like it but there's most people do. So I think all the things that we are doing including the visible things that you see in-store. And then look, at the end of the day, it's a value proposition. Our average gross margin is in the very, very low double digits, 11% or 12%, implying of whatever 13% or so percent markup. Traditional retail grocers are in the mid to high 20s and other big boxes are above that and regular retails way above that. So also it's got to be a combination of all those things. We have got to figure out ways to get you in and I think we felt so far at least successfully, sometimes begrudgingly but successfully figuring out how to get you stuff online as well. And it will be a combination but we will have to see over time.\nMichael Lasser: And my follow-up question is, speaking of online, given the success that you have enjoyed as of late, coupled with the acquisition you made a couple of months ago and the overall increase in online penetration that you have witnessed across retail in the last few months, is there an inclination within Costco to push harder to market your online channel more to expand your offerings to consumers? Or because of the desire to still push consumers into the store that you will maintain your posture?\nRichard Galanti: Sure. Well, I think by necessity, we have responded and maybe for those of you, sometimes, I not suggesting to you Michael, that feel that we have been a little stubborn or are not winded to some of this stuff, we still want you to come in. You are going to buy more stuff when you come in, period. And we think we can do both. I mean, we recognize and I think white goods was the best example way before COVID. Four years ago, in the U.S. we did $50 million in white good sales. Three years later, we did $600 million, on our way to $1 billion, which is getting there faster simply because of COVID right now. Certainly, the acquisition of Innovel helps a lot of higher ticket big and bulky items, many of which people don't want to put in the back of their suburban or truck and take home. So I think we will have to see over time. We feel we have also been pretty good, again COVID has changed things a little bit right now, doing marketing and having email promotions that are in warehouse. And again, time will tell over time and we will figure it out together.\nMichael Lasser: Understand. Thank you very much and good luck moving forward. I appreciate it.\nOperator: We have our next question from Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.\nJohn Parke: Hi. Good afternoon Richard. It's actually John Parke, on for Chuck. Can you talk a little bit more about what you are seeing from a gas balance perspective towards the end of the quarter? A crossover to the business in the club? And then how some of those metrics have changed as certain areas have opened back up and are starting to normalize?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Look, just driving to work, you know, there's less gas gallons being bought. I think it has picked up a little, just hearing from the news and things. I know in the state of Washington, they have each day as a percentage of cars traveling on different interstates is improving a little bit. Part of it is some of the stay at home stuff and part of it is the weather's gotten nicer and people want to get out of Dodge. It has to impact a little. One of our frequency catalysts or the frequency catalysts that we have always talked about are fresh foods, executive member and gas. And so to the extent that gas has come down a little bit, that hurts a little bit. Offsetting that has been the fact that, one, the average ticket in the store was way up which helps offset the lower traffic. And again, who knows what tomorrow brings. We are encouraged of how we got through so far. We have seen some things pick up a little bit in the last several weeks in terms of categories as weather turned. Certainly, some of the openings, I think, should help us. But again, we will let you know. Hello?\nOperator: Chuck Grom still on the line, sir? We have our next question from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nJohn Heinbockel: Hi. Richard, when you think about the Innovel, what's the biggest impact that's going to have from a customer perspective? And maybe it's just coincidence, it looks like, you look at some of the mailers, you have been pushing big and bulky a little more here. So that's not tied to Innovel ? That's just what you would have done anyway?\nRichard Galanti: I think it's kind of what we would have done anyway. It certainly is because we now have the confidence that we can provide a better service at frankly a lower total price. Innovel was one of our suppliers that has always done a good job, as have some others. And as we build more volume on it and get more density, that too will allow us to lower the cost and lower the cost to our members. Certainly, with that and what we have seen again, I think if you had asked us four months ago, hey, we are going to have this big COVID thing and this is what's going to happen, we certainly didn't know that we would sell more big and bulky items. What were finding is, is because people are at home, notwithstanding some of the economic things of layoffs and furloughs, people are buying things for the house. We saw that again more recently with not related to big and bulky but lawn and garden. If you would have asked us two months ago, how is lawn and garden going to look, we would say it's going to not be very good because of all the economic issues. So I think at the end of the day, we are marketing additionally right now because we have the confidence that we can, we have seen the delivery times on certain big and bulky items improved dramatically on small groups of items as we onboard some of those items. It's a year-plus process.\nJohn Heinbockel: And on the savings book, the thought process there, it looks like the assortment sort of getting back to normal, right, from a food and sundries standpoint. When is that fully back to normal? And do you go back to mailings or stay digital-only for now?\nRichard Galanti: We would go back to mailings in June.\nJohn Heinbockel: And the assortment normalizes in June as well?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. For the most part, yes.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We have our next question from Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open.\nKaren Short: Hi. Thanks very much. A couple of questions on, I guess, e-com in general. Wondering first, within the membership growth, is any color you could provide on growth in online sign-ups versus walk-ins? And then I wanted just to ask a little bit more about e-com generally. I mean you have kind of obviously, you are blessed and cursed with very high velocity units and you have had to do the distancing, which has impacted traffic. But would that kind of cause you to rethink potentially a much more robust click and collect model? And then I just had one other follow-up.\nRichard Galanti: Well, first of all, in terms of online sign-ups, a member that, again there are some members that aren't coming in or coming less frequently, to the extent they didn't come in the first part of this month and this is normally when they would come in and when they went to the checkout, it would notify them that they are up for renewal. They are now getting their email which they would have gotten, had they not renewed. And so that's pushing some of that way. Certainly, anecdotally, there have been plenty of people that have signed up to become members simply because of the one-day fresh or the two-day dry grocery. And so we are seeing a big push. I think it is too early to tell what happens in the future. I think more of it will go online just like everything else in life and we will do that. In terms of click and collect, we have very limited click and collect right now. It's in some of those high-value jewelry, small electronics. We did add pharmacy to it and that's not only click and collect, that's click and deliver through -- we are expanding. We are not everywhere yet with the benefit of Instacart. Tires, we are doing that where you could go online, order it and schedule it, schedule your tire installation. Photo. So we are doing more things. But if you are asking the question, to buy online and pickup in store in general, we are not looking at doing that on a regular product basis. We do delivery instead again through third parties in a big way as well as our own today.\nKaren Short: Okay. And then I mean I know it kind of seems like a lifetime from now, but when we look towards the fall, as it relates to merchandising like back-to-school, Halloween, I guess the question is, two, well two. How much flexibility do you have to pivot to the extent that there really isn't much of a Halloween or back-to-school? And then the second question is just bigger picture. Everybody loves to go to Costco for the samplings. So I am just curious how you are thinking about that going forward? Is that something that we will not likely ever see again? Is there anything that you are discussing in terms of how you could reintroduce that safely? Anything there?\nRichard Galanti: Karen, I missed the second part of the question. In terms of how do we feel our ability to pivot, look, if you go back two or three months ago, we were cutting orders, reducing orders recognizing there is going to be plenty of merchandise out there in these categories. Certainly for things like Christmas, I think we reduced the selection of a few things. And so a little more regular items than out there items. And now we are pivoting to try to get a few of those items, which are available. So frankly I think in some ways it's been easier for us because we have so many fewer SKUs and we are willing to try a few new things. And now, I didn't get the second part of your question.\nKaren Short: The other part of it was just people love going to Costco for samplings. Food sampling, that's a bit part of the experience. So how are you thinking about that, just bigger picture? When we get to a new kind of abnormal?\nRichard Galanti: We are going to start doing some things in mid-June on a slow rollout basis in sampling. I can't tell you anymore but it's needless to say, not going to be where you go and just pick up an open sample with your fingers. But the sampling and both food and nonfood items are popular. And road shows as well. I think you will see a little more excitement on the road show side. So things that we can do to get people excited about coming in.\nKaren Short: Okay. Great. Thanks.\nOperator: We have our next question from Greg Badishkanian from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSpencer Hanus: Good afternoon. This is actually Spencer Hanus, on for Greg. Just turning to e-commerce again. Can you give us any color on the repeat rates that you are seeing from the new customers that it looks like you are adding to the platform? And then have you been able to take advantage of some of the lower online advertising costs that are in the marketplace today?\nRichard Galanti: On the second question, the latter question, I don't know. I am not up to speed on that in terms of lower prices. I would assume, that's what I have read in the paper in general. So I would assume we have some of that ability, recognizing we don't spend a lot to start with. And the first question was what? Repeat business? Yes, you know what? That's another one that I don't know off the top of my head. Sorry.\nSpencer Hanus: Great. And then just if we could turn to small business customers. Can you talk about what you are seeing there? How did their sales go throughout the quarter for that segment of your customer base?\nRichard Galanti: Well, look, I mean food service related small business is down everywhere. It's been helped a little bit by some, we are less about serving the big restaurant chains but the mom-and-pop restaurants. And so that the takeouts in your neighborhood, the Japanese, the Chinese, the Thai, those types of things, they are doing some business. Arguably, what business we are losing on some of those things, we are gaining because you are eating at home. So overall, I think just in looking at fresh foods and the food items of what we call food and sundries, it's been way up, particularly in fresh foods and somewhat in the rest. So I think overall, we have been blessed. Now, the question beyond that is, what happens when everything opens up? I think it's going to be, the new normal is still going to take some time. You see on the news that even in states where it's been open, there's not everybody running to sit down. And then there's restrictions on how many people can be in a certain place at a given time. So again, having fresh foods has been certainly something that's been very positive for us.\nSpencer Hanus: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We have our next question from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Your line is open.\nKelly Bania: Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Richard, I think you mentioned executive penetration, if I heard it correctly, was up 135,000, which seem to be just a little bit of slowdown. I am wondering if it was impacted by the environment? And if you have to do anything to change your process in terms of convincing members to upgrade there?\nRichard Galanti: Well, yes, it fluctuates all over the board. Certainly it shows improvement when we add a country like we have Japan and Korea in the last couple of years. It certainly is down from its peak a few years back. Probably the biggest things are that getting back to traffic, traffic is down a little bit. The other thing is, one of things we do in store a lot is something we internally call e-blocks or electronic blocks. So based on when your membership is scanned, based on your historical purchases, it makes all the sense in the world for you to upgrade to be an executive member. We have chosen for the last couple few months not to do e-block because it's one-on-one direct contact with the member while they are waiting in line at the register. And so we probably, my guess would be a little higher and then we haven't a lot of warehouses year-to-date. So we will get back to normal on these things. But it does not raise a concern for us at all on this point.\nKelly Bania: Okay. And just as a follow-up, in terms of renewal rates, I think you mentioned any impact from COVID there will be in the next few months. Maybe just can you give us any color on what we should expect to see? I was thinking maybe there could be a positive impact to renewal rates from this environment? But any color you can share would be helpful.\nRichard Galanti: Well, we do what's called, we have always done it this way, a fully captured rate for renewal rate. So lets say you signed up originally in January. And so sometime in December, you get your renewal notice. And let's say, we ultimately get to that 90%, 91% renewal rate in the U.S. and Canada. By the end of January, you then draw the people that signed up in January, maybe by the end of January, I am making these numbers up here, at 75% and by the end of February you are at 82%, at the end of March you are at 85% and it takes, you might even get last 0.5% or 1% of that renewal rate six months out because if somebody that was a snowbird or somebody that just doesn't come in that often, there is always going to be that. In addition, whenever you have a group of new members, irrespective of whether it's online and in-store or in a new country, you have a lower renewal rate in that first respective year and then it builds each year over as year three becomes a combination of somebody renewing for the second time at a higher percentage than those that signed up originally in year two and were renewing for the first time in your three. So we don't know which direction. We know that we want to say that because we don't know where it's going to go. But the renewal rate right now is mostly related to stuff that happened four, five and six months ago and seven months ago.\nKelly Bania: Thank you.\nOperator: We have our next question from Paul Lejuez from Citi. Your line is open.\nPaul Lejuez: Hi. Thanks. Richard, can you remind us of the economics of an online order in terms of basket size and what's in that basket? Then separately, curious if there are any categories within the box that you would say you are a bit high from an in-store perspective? Thanks.\nRichard Galanti: Well, first of all, from online, there is regular online which includes rather big ticket items. So I don't have the number in front of me but if in-store during regular times the average frontend transaction was in the $160 range, $140 range, I am sorry $140 range, online which include a lot of big ticket items was probably $300 to $400 range. As we have added two-day grocery, that number has come down. Certainly, while we don't again include in e-com the same day grocery that the likes of Instacart and others come in and do, that's going to be lower as well. So all these things are in flux right now.\nPaul Lejuez: Got you. Then on the inventory side?\nRichard Galanti: Again, I am happy to report that it is less than we braced for the worst case a few months ago or a couple months ago when we decided to raise some extra capital. Might we have to take things like seasonal apparel and seasonal lawn and garden and luggage, we do have some luggage to sell you, but it's a small category. But at the end of the day, all those things are less than we thought. So yes, there will be a small amount of items, probably in the few hundred to several hundred million dollars that will hold for a season or up to a year. But these are not things that are going out of style, even in items like apparel, which again I think we did, our buyers did a very good job of mitigating that impact initially with the suppliers. And also it's come back a little better than we thought. Not all the way back by any stretch but better than we thought. And in addition, we are not exactly high-fashion where things are going out of style. A lot of things that we have, whether it's some furniture items or apparel -- our senior merchant in the room is not pleased with that comment. But we are basic, we are fashion basic. We are not [indiscernible] about that.\nPaul Lejuez: Got you. And then just Richard, what percent of members shop the club in 3Q versus last year? And did this quarter mark a peak in that metric?\nRichard Galanti: You know, I never looked at it. I mean it's a good question. We will have that for next time. Certainly, it's a lower percentage this quarter simply because of new members or people that cited, I mean I have friends that have chosen not to go physically anywhere and they are having things delivered and they love the same day fresh. So my guess, it's come down a little. Why don't we have two more questions?\nPaul Lejuez: Thanks. Good luck.\nOperator: We have our next question from Greg Melich from Evercore. Your line is open.\nGreg Melich: Hi. Thank you. So Richard, it seems sound like e-commerce was probably 8% of the business in the quarter and if I am interpreting it correctly, should we think of it as that that would have grown to over 10% if you include the Instacart as part of e-commerce?\nRichard Galanti: Yes.\nGreg Melich: Okay. And then second is on inflation. You talked about obviously deflation in gas and what that did to the topline. Has there been any inflation, especially given some of the shortages and proteins, et cetera that's worth noting as an offset?\nRichard Galanti: Overall, ex gas, overall it's very small. I am actually guessing because it's a lot more sales volume than there is inventory level. But on certain limited items, we have seen extreme examples were like eggs for a period of time. Some of the protein items like meat. But I would guess that it's impacting us a little less than others in some of those categories because of some of our supply relationships and strength but it depends and it's coming back now, it's coming down. So overall, I would say very little difference than it would have been.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And then on Innovel, just a follow-up on that. How much of Innovel's business was distributing other people's things? And where does that revenue show up? And how you are thinking about either growing or reallocating that capacity?\nRichard Galanti: Well, keep in mind, Innovel is a business built over decades to serve Sears, it's owner. And Sears of course has come down dramatically over the last few years. And while I can't disclose all the numbers I am aware of, the component that was actually still servicing their needs had come down. And then also they had gone through their own reorganization as a retail company. And with that, I think they lost the business along the way. So you know, there is an infrastructure and a capacity in place, infrastructure in place with great capacity. And so we view this as an ability to do great things with.\nGreg Melich: Could you describe that capacity a little bit? Like just number of employees or footage?\nRichard Galanti: I think employees were 1,500. There is I think 11 large facilities, call it the roughly 800,000 to 1.2 million square foot facilities. And then about 105 smaller facilities which could be as small as 8,000 or 10,000 feet or as big as 50,000 or 60,000. And spread out generally serving I think 85% or 90% of the U.S. And again there's a lot of ability, it has a lot of capacity. And we were doing, we worked with them for five-plus years, I believe. But like anyone else working with them, we are doing a small piece of our business because we didn't know what was happening to the business as it's parent was going through it's on restructuring.\nGreg Melich: Got it. Thanks. Well, good luck.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you. Last question.\nOperator: We have our last question from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nErica Eiler: Good afternoon. This is actually Erica Eiler, on for Rupesh. Thanks for fitting us in and to hearing our question. So I wanted to touch on the store capacity restrictions that you put in place. You talked a little bit about the impact from some of the ancillary businesses being closed had on your sales. Are you able to quantify for us what you think the impact may have been to sales from the store capacity limitations and restrictions that you put in place? And as things start to open back up in certain markets, are there any changes in these restrictions you put in place? And can we expect to see these restrictions weigh up on sales for a bit longer?\nRichard Galanti: Well, the only thing I would pointed out earlier was, those businesses like optical, hearing aid, a reduced food court, those things was somewhere in the middle between one and two percentage points impact in Q3. Aside from that, when we went from generally closing Monday through Friday and 8:30, we went to I think 6:00. But we also added an hour in the morning for elderly and expanded that from two days to three days now to all five weekdays. We have not tried to quantify that. I can tell you that when we have had some very busy locations historically and we said let's add an hour in the morning or an hour later at night, what we found is, we tended to just spread the business. So I think the same thing here. There is not a lot of big impact other than our qualitative view was that there's a lot more impact from shelter in place and stay at home and come and get what you need and leave than there is from anything else. And again as that, I was encouraged by some of the things I have seen with a couple of the other retail apparel stores that have just started to open and are showing good numbers, because people are coming back. So I think that net net is encouraging. But I don't think it was a big impact to us either way. By the way, yes, there was and you noticed in our numbers, Canada was weaker than the U.S. In Canada and Quebec there's actually current and outstanding limitations of Sunday closes which is new over the last few months. And there is also I think been a little bit more stricter generally over up there, either stricter or people listening better to stay at home issues. And so we have seen, in a country where we are the only game in town in terms of warehouse clubs, we have seen weaker traffic and therefore slightly weaker numbers than the U.S.\nErica Eiler: Okay. Well, I guess that's a good segue into my next question. So I was just curious on international side. If there is any more color you can provide on what you are seeing internationally with regards to Coronavirus impacting? Are there any notable differences in terms of behavior or any other callouts versus the U.S.?\nRichard Galanti: Well, again, putting on my blinders for a minute. Taiwan and China are the most encouraging. China, we have one location, of course, that's been open for less than a year. So we don't have a year-over-year comparison. Taiwan is quite strong. Japan is quite strong, maybe a few weeks behind that. We see Australia coming back. So overall, that gives us encouraging news for the U.S. and Canada. But part of that answer is, so what until we see it.\nErica Eiler: Okay. Great. Thank you so much.\nRichard Galanti: Okay. Well, thank you everyone. And me and my guys here are around to answer questions. Have a good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Galanti",
            "content": "Thank you Joseph and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the 12 weeks ended May 10. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $838 million or $1.89 per diluted share. This compared to $906 million or $2.05 per diluted share last year in the third quarter. Now, this year's third quarter was negatively impacted by direct expenses of $283 million pretax or $0.47 per diluted share from incremental wage, safety and sanitation costs related to COVID-19 and last year's third quarter number of $2.05 included the benefit from a nonrecurring tax item of $73 million or $0.16 per diluted share. Net sales for the quarter increased 7.3% to $36.45 billion, up from $33.96 billion last year in the third quarter. On a same-store comparable sales basis for the third quarter, for the 12 weeks on a reported basis, the U.S. was at 5.9%. Excluding gas deflation and FX impact, the 5.9% would have been for the 12 weeks an 8.0%. Canada on a reported basis was minus 2.5%, ex gas deflation and FX plus 3.0%. Other international came in on a reported basis at 6.2% and again ex gas deflation and FX, plus 12.2%. All told, the total company came in with a reported 4.8% and again ex gas deflation and FX, the 4.8% would have been 7.8%. I might also note that e-commerce on a reported basis was 64.5% comp and ex gas deflation or ex FX, 66.1%. Now foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 110 basis points and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 190 basis points for the total company therefore to 300 basis points. Additionally, gasoline volumes or gallons were down about 20% year-over-year in the quarter as a result of less driving due to the pandemic. The impact of gasoline gallons is not in the adjusted figures that I just described above. In terms of traffic, our shopping frequency decreased in the quarter worldwide by 4.1% and in the U.S. by 2.0%. Our average transaction or ticket was up 9.3% during the third quarter and the 9.3% does include the negative impacts from gas deflation and FX. Now, our third quarter comp sales figures did reflect also that a few of our businesses, notably optical, hearing aids and photo were closed for much of Q3 and a good portion of our food court item offerings were eliminated also for much of Q3 as well we eliminated the food court seating during this time. Reopenings of these began, the ones that were closed, began on April 30, 10 days prior to the third quarter end with about 20% of the locations back to operating by Q3 end. In the past two to three weeks, nearly all will be back in operation by mid-June. In terms of the food courts which have been open but again a much more limited menu, we have added some but not all the items back as of now. In all, an estimated hit to the reported sales numbers that we gave you earlier in Q3 by one to two percentage points by those items being closed or restricted. Next on the income statement. Membership fee income reported came in at $815 million or 2.24%, up 5% or $39 million from $776 million or 2.9% last year in Q3. Ex FX weakness, the $39 million increase and 5% increase would have been up $47 million or 6%. During the quarter, we had two new openings and a total of four year-to-date. In terms of renewal rates, at Q3 end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate came in at 91.0%, a tick up from where we were at Q2 end and the worldwide rate came in at 88.4%, the same as it was a fiscal quarter ago. Keep in mind that any impact on renewal rates from COVID, positive or negative, are reflected over the next several months. In terms the number of members at Q3 end, member households and cardholders. In terms of households, we ended the third quarter with 55.8 million households, up from 55.3 million 12 weeks earlier. And total cardholders came in at 101.8 million, up from 100.9 million 12 weeks earlier. At Q3 end, paid executive memberships came in at 21.8 million, an increase of 135,000 over the last 12 weeks. Going down to the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin was higher year-over-year by 54 basis points on a reported basis, coming in at 11.53%, up from 10.99%. Now, the 54, ex gas deflation would have been plus 33 basis points. As I usually do, I will ask you to write down a few numbers in two columns and then we will go through that explanation. In terms reported, in Q3 2020 year-over-year, the core merchandise was up 51 basis points on a reported basis and without gas deflation up 33. Ancillary businesses was on a reported basis plus 26 basis points, ex gas deflation plus 21. The 2% reward, minus six and minus four basis points. Other, minus 17 and minus 17. And you add up those two columns, total reported again up 54 basis points on a reported basis and up 33 basis points. And gross margin was up 33 basis points, ex-gas deflation. Now, the core merchandise component of gross margin again higher by 51 or 33 ex deflation. Keep in mind that in the quarter, we had a decent sales shift from ancillary and other businesses to core businesses which resulted in a higher contribution of our total gross margin dollars coming from the core. Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation to only their own sales or what we call core-on-core, margins year-over-year were lower by 17 basis points. Five basis points, by the way, which was losses related to our new poultry complex. This is something I have pointed out in the last two quarters and will probably do so next quarter as well. In total, pretty similar in fact to our year-over-year impact in Q2. So while higher penetration of our total sales came from the core this year, it was at a slightly lower gross margin percentage year-over-year. This is mostly attributed to sales mix, both between and within merchandise categories. Our fresh foods gross margin percentage was up, again despite any first-year headwinds from the ramp up process associated with poultry complex. The strength in fresh was a result of high sales, driving down our spoilage as well as labor costs as a percent of sales, being able to leverage those at a normal rate. Softlines, food and sundries and hardlines, all had lower margin percentage year-over-year in the quarter. One example, non-foods which is both hardlines and softlines. Non-foods was impacted by shift in sales towards lower margin departments, particularly things like majors and big-ticket electronics. Ancillary and other business gross margin in the two columns, higher by 26 basis points. And again, 21 higher basis points ex gas deflation. This result was primarily due to strength in gas and e-com gross margin dollars year-over-year, partially offset by lower penetration of ancillary sales due to lower gas prices and volumes and closures of some of those ancillary businesses that I talked about earlier. Several of those businesses have higher gross margins. 2% reward was higher or was a hit to gross margin by six basis points on a reported basis and four ex deflation, implying that slightly higher percentage of our sales were eligible for the executive member reward. The other line item, 17 basis points to the negative. 12 of the 17 basis points is attributable to the COVID costs and the 12 basis points, that's about $44 million of the $283 million number that was mentioned in the press release. These are the costs for incremental wages, safety and sanitation costs allocated to our cost departments and merchandise fulfillment operations. So it hits the margin. The other five basis points or $19.7 million came from accruing reserve for certain third-party gift cards and ticket programs. This latter $19.7 million was not included in the $283 million total amount that we called out as a direct incremental expenses from COVID. Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A percentage year-over-year was higher by 59 basis points, coming in at 10.51% of sales, up from 9.92%. Ex gas deflation, the minus 59 would have been minus 40 or higher by 40. If you would again please jot down the following SG&A components and then we will go through that. Core operations reported was plus nine or lower by nine, a benefit of nine. Ex gas deflation, plus 24 or a benefit of 24 basis points. Central was zero and plus two. Stock compensation, plus three and plus three. Other, minus 71 and minus 69. And you add up those two columns, you get to the reported SG&A increase of 59 basis points and ex gas and FX -- ex gas deflation, rather, minus 40 or by a higher by 40 basis points. Now again, the core operations component lower by nine and ex gas deflation lower by 24. SG&A in the core operations, that's excluding the COVID-related expenses that I will talk about in the minute, they were, needless to say, leveraged with strong core merchandise sales. Central was essentially flat and a slight improvement relative to the including the ex gas deflation. Stock comp, no surprises there. It was a slight benefit to SG&A by three basis points. And again the other component of 71 or 69 ex gas deflation, of the 71, 66 basis points of the 71 is attributable to the incremental costs of COVID-19 or $239 million of that $283 million total amount that was in the press release. Again these are the cost for incremental wages and safety and sanitation related to direct expenses. The balance of the 71 basis point figure was five basis points or $18.5 million, this came from the costs associated with the acquisition and integration-related expenses of our recent acquisition of Innovel, that last mile delivery and installation operation for big and bulky that we acquired a few months ago. Next on the income statement is pre-opening expense. Pre-opening expense was lower by $6 million, coming in at $8 million in the quarter versus $14 million a year ago. Again, we had two openings this year. Last year in the quarter, we had three. Although, chunks of each of these numbers relate to pending openings in Q4 as well. All told, reported operating income in the third quarter of 2020 increased by 5.1%, coming in at $1,179 million this year, compared to $1,122 million a year ago. Now this 5% increase is notwithstanding the incremental cost that I just talked about, the $283 million as well as the $19.7 million and the $18.5 million that I just mentioned as well. Those are all taken in the third quarter. Below the operating income line. Interest expense was higher year-over-year by $2 million coming in at $37 million this year in the quarter versus $35 million a year ago. Recall, that we completed a $4 billion debt offering on April 20 during the third quarter. Following the completion of the debt offering, we called the outstanding debt due May of 2021. That was a $1 billion tranche and an additional $5 million tranche that was due in February 2022. Both of these tranches, we have paid off this morning after a 30-day call notice. There will be a pretax expense of $36 million related to the earlier time and our make-whole of this debt which will hit our Q4 results on the interest income and other line in our P&L. Next on the income statement, interest income and other for the quarter. It was lower by $15 million year-over-year, mostly attributed to lower interest income and mostly attributed to lower interest rates within that. Overall, reported pretax income in Q3 of fiscal 2020 was up 3.6%, coming in at $1,163 million versus $1,123 million last year and again the $1,163 million is after taking the impacts of those charges that I previously mentioned. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q3 this year was 26.7%. Last year, it was 18.5% tax rate. Again, last year, it included a benefit of a nonrecurring tax item of $73 million. A few other items of note in terms of warehouse expansion. As I mentioned, we opened two units in the third quarter. That puts us at five, actually five units total through the first three quarters. We expect in Q4 to open 10 including two relos, so net of eight. So it looks like our net total this year will be somewhere around 13. There's been a few that have been impacted by COVID-19 in terms of construction delays and have been pushed into the first part of fiscal 2021 which starts in early September. As of Q3 end, total warehouse square footage stood at 115 million square feet. In terms of capital expenditures, the third quarter of fiscal 2020 total spend was approximately $626 million and our estimated CapEx for all of fiscal 2020 is currently in the $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion range, a slight decline from what where we had guesstimated and estimated a quarter ago. And again, I think that has to do with some of the delays in construction since this COVID issue. In terms of e-commerce. As I mentioned earlier, overall our e-commerce sales on a reported basis increased 64.5% and 66.1% ex FX. I should note that within that 61%, like many retailers out there, we saw an increasingly level of strength in e-commerce sales over the last few months. If I look through the 12 week, the three four-week periods that comprise our 12 week third quarter, roughly that 64.5% reported number in the first four weeks was in the 25% range, in the next four weeks in the 50% increased range and the most recent in the last four weeks in the 90% range, but totaling that 64.5% on a reported basis. A few of the stronger departments, health and beauty aids, office, majors, housewares and small electrics. Total online grocery grew at an incredible rate during the third quarter, as I am sure did at many places. The comp numbers just mentioned again follow, that's the 64% number, they follow our historical convention where we exclude our third-party or same-day grocery program since that comes into the warehouse to be picked up by the third-party and delivered to our member. If we were to include that third-party in our e-commerce number, that mid 60% comp number would be slightly over 100%. So we have seen big strength in driving the business that way. Overall, our e-com sites have worked pretty smoothly during the quarter despite dramatic volume increases and as well we were able to improve on delivery times throughout the quarter as we adjusted to the ramped up order volumes. Now turning to Coronavirus and all the issues and impacts surrounding it. From a sales perspective, as discussed last quarter and indicated by our monthly sales results that we do, we started Q3 strong. I think it started actually in the fourth week of February and then into the first two-and-half weeks of March with very strong sales as people were stocking up prior to the implementation, the concern about availability of certain key products as well as the implementation of various stay at home orders. The middle of the quarter was weaker as many of geographies in which we operate had issued mandates limiting movement as well we had implemented our own restrictions during these times. Recently our sales have started to recover somewhat as states have begun to relax restrictions. Within the merchandise categories, foods, fresh and other essentials have been very strong despite out of stocks on some items throughout the quarter such as toilet paper, paper towels, cleaning supplies, et cetera, meats and proteins toward the end of the quarter, hand sanitizers and the like. Office and majors were also strong during the quarter driven by work from home initiatives while most other discretionary categories were a little weaker during the quarter such as jewelry, luggage, third-party gift cards, they were generally weak. Other weak categories which include things like sporting goods, lawn and garden, patio and apparel, while they were weak, they have rebounded somewhat towards the end of the quarter. From a supply chain perspective, I am going to give you 40,000 foot view of that. On the nonfood side, as it relates to imports from China, most the factories are now up and running. Other major country suppliers, India for textiles and domestics, Mexico primarily for things like TV assembly, a few weeks behind China in terms of getting back to normal but each week is showing improvement. On the food and sundry sides, paper goods still on allocation and item limits on certain items in certain regions. Sporadic limits on canned food items like tuna and chicken. The toughest areas, again, are still hand sanitizers, disinfecting wipes and Lysol sprays and the like. Items like milk and butter are generally okay. And also, we have eliminated like frozen, certain frozen proteins like chicken and beef items. In terms of fresh, on the protein side, the merchandise is there but challenging from a production and processing side. Currently, for us, pork is the least affected but somewhat affected by what we have done for the last couple of three weeks, I believe. On fresh beef, chicken and pork items, those protein items, we limit three fresh items in total. We also have limits of one per SKU on certain frozen items like 10 pounds of hamburger patties or chicken breast and the like. In terms of seafood and produce, that's all good. And again, talking to our buyers in these categories, they are generally, again probably with the exception of the hand sanitizer because it's not just people who are hoarding it, a great increase in use and demand of those items continued. But we expect continued improvement generally each week. And lastly, Costco travel, it was obviously significantly impacted during the quarter due to reduced demand as well as cancellations of previously booked trips. Members are now starting to actually book travel again, although generally further out than we have historically seen and of course we book those results when the trips or activities occur. Warehouses have overall remained open, although we did operate at reduced hours at most of our U.S. locations for several weeks during the quarter. Regular hours resume May 4 with an additional hour on weekday mornings for seniors and persons with disabilities. Warehouses are still following social distancing and sanitizing guidelines. Additionally, as discussed, some of our warehouse businesses like hearing aid, optical and photo and to a partial extent, the food courts, were closed or mitigated during the majority of the quarter. Also effective May 4, we now require all members and employees in the warehouses to wear masks. During the quarter, including again that big $283 million number, we spent about $32 million on masks, gloves and incremental cleaning supplies and things like plexiglass partitions, you name it, all related to COVID. But that's in that $283 million number. Some of the initiatives related to the $283 million in costs will extend into Q4. We would expect the incremental expenses related to COVID, these types of expenses related to COVID to exceed $100 million in Q4 but it would be quite a bit lower than the $283 million that we had in Q3. We will have to just wait and see, though. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results for the four weeks ending this Sunday, May 31 next Wednesday, June 3 after market close. With that, I will open it up for Q&A and turn it back to Joseph. Thank you. I really can't call anything as a preview. Some of the comments I made in this document as it relates to towards the end of the quarter, we saw certain things pick up. The fact that we went back recently to full hours, we are all better both us, our employees and our members are better getting through the warehouse. So seasonally, I think some of the items that were online has picked up that we talked about. But we will wait and see next week. Generally, no. But what we talked about way back when -- at the end of Q2 and the beginning of this quarter, we saw some pickup when there was a lot of you know, when we had these crazy strong numbers and people were coming in to buy all those essentials, short supply, high-demand and short supply items. We saw some additional sign-ups but not meaningful relative to our whole company in those weeks, towards the end of February and the first half of March. Other than that, I think the fact that the traffic is down a little bit but the average ticket is up, you have got some members that are coming in and bulking up a little more. And then you have some members that are not coming in as often. So that hits you a little bit but overall we think that we are in pretty good stead. Yes. One other comment is that we have also seen a switch from walk-in sign-ups to online sign-ups. And that's good. When you sign-up online, I know you are also required to have auto bill which is a positive for renewal rates long term. I don't think necessarily. The only total increase is where we have gone to some additional suppliers in some very limited items. So we have expanded our supplier network in some limited cases. Beyond to that is more of a shift. It started with, if you will, some of the big and bulky items. And this started well before COVID, like white goods. And that's continuing and certainly the strength that we have had online, whether it's reported online through our two-day grocery or through e-commerce or certain third-party providers like Instacart and Shipt and others, all that stuff has driven some of the business from the warehouse to online. And again, I think, if I go back six, eight, 10 weeks ago, whatever the normal time to get something was, particularly like two-day grocery was well more than two days, we are back to two days. Same day, our third-party suppliers had challenges. They ramped up in the 200,000-plus new employees in a matter of weeks. That too has gotten a lot better in the last few weeks. So I hate to use the word strategic, we certainly know that big and bulky can be done very effectively online with a few displays in the warehouse as well but have that delivered and installed through online and that will continue. It probably has been expanded a little bit because of this people at home, things like exercise equipment and like big electronics and things. Well, you know, there was a perfect good storm in the last quarter as it relates to margins and gas. And I think there's, not even our information, but there's public information on strength in retailers that sell gasoline in terms of gross margins. So we certainly benefited from that. A little offset to that was a reduced number of gallons. But nonetheless, it was particularly strong and I think that's evidenced in the matrix. You have higher margins on some of those other ancillary businesses like optical and hearing aid. While small in size, there's a higher margin because we have to account for the additional cost of optometrist and hearing aid technicians and the like. And so, those types of things, gas being the biggest piece of it towards the other stuff but it all ends up there was net net good for us in the quarter. Fortunately, we haven't seen a lot of markdowns. Apparel, for us, is a pretty, there is a big part of it that's seasonal. And when this thing first started, we were able to talk to suppliers and work deals where in some cases certain things hadn't been made yet or they had the raw materials but they hadn't finished the product. So let's pay for part of the finished, for the raw materials but hold off until next season. We have held on. One of the reasons we went and borrowed money was looking at the worst case which, in our view, has not happened but what if we had a wholesome big volumes of seasonal stuff. We were going to, whatever commitments we had, we were going to respect. But I think, in combination of working with our vendors as well as sales have rebounded in those areas a little more than expected. It's not that people are coming in and going down every aisle. Some are just going getting their essentials and heading out of Dodge, but at the end of the day, I think as the weather has turned, we have been a little bit more, felt a little more good about things. Who knows what tomorrow brings, though. Well, first of all, it's like I think everybody, for us, it's certainly a lower margin business as we tried to build it over time. It's really the gross margin dollars are stronger because of the huge sales volume. We are spending more money on it. And so probably, I don't have it in front of me, but as a percent of profit, as a percent of sales I am sure it is down a little bit and that's expected. But the total gross margin dollars are up, simply because of the sheer strength of it. Well, we certainly don't believe that. There is going to be two or three new normals over the next two or three years and probably not a real new normal and then with its own set of difficulties besides that. We are asked the question constantly. When I talk about this giant 10-plus fold increase in same-day grocery delivery, that's certainly because people, there is a group of people that don't want to go out. There's others that want to come in but they coming less frequently and buy more each time. There's going to be some new normals. Our guess is that whatever it's gotten to is not going to necessarily, maybe there is a back down a little bit at some point, but still be higher than it was the day before all this? Sure. But who knows? That's something that we talk about every day around here. And I think over time, there's been a lot of questions and we are happy with our renewal rates and we are all going to have get past this. One of things that we and some others, what I will call the big essential retailers, we have all been fortunate that we been open. And when you talk to people, anecdotally they feel frankly more comfortable coming into a Costco which is bigger, more wide open certainly the six feet apart that we are all doing, with the mask requirements. There are a few people that don't like it but there's most people do. So I think all the things that we are doing including the visible things that you see in-store. And then look, at the end of the day, it's a value proposition. Our average gross margin is in the very, very low double digits, 11% or 12%, implying of whatever 13% or so percent markup. Traditional retail grocers are in the mid to high 20s and other big boxes are above that and regular retails way above that. So also it's got to be a combination of all those things. We have got to figure out ways to get you in and I think we felt so far at least successfully, sometimes begrudgingly but successfully figuring out how to get you stuff online as well. And it will be a combination but we will have to see over time. Sure. Well, I think by necessity, we have responded and maybe for those of you, sometimes, I not suggesting to you Michael, that feel that we have been a little stubborn or are not winded to some of this stuff, we still want you to come in. You are going to buy more stuff when you come in, period. And we think we can do both. I mean, we recognize and I think white goods was the best example way before COVID. Four years ago, in the U.S. we did $50 million in white good sales. Three years later, we did $600 million, on our way to $1 billion, which is getting there faster simply because of COVID right now. Certainly, the acquisition of Innovel helps a lot of higher ticket big and bulky items, many of which people don't want to put in the back of their suburban or truck and take home. So I think we will have to see over time. We feel we have also been pretty good, again COVID has changed things a little bit right now, doing marketing and having email promotions that are in warehouse. And again, time will tell over time and we will figure it out together. Yes. Look, just driving to work, you know, there's less gas gallons being bought. I think it has picked up a little, just hearing from the news and things. I know in the state of Washington, they have each day as a percentage of cars traveling on different interstates is improving a little bit. Part of it is some of the stay at home stuff and part of it is the weather's gotten nicer and people want to get out of Dodge. It has to impact a little. One of our frequency catalysts or the frequency catalysts that we have always talked about are fresh foods, executive member and gas. And so to the extent that gas has come down a little bit, that hurts a little bit. Offsetting that has been the fact that, one, the average ticket in the store was way up which helps offset the lower traffic. And again, who knows what tomorrow brings. We are encouraged of how we got through so far. We have seen some things pick up a little bit in the last several weeks in terms of categories as weather turned. Certainly, some of the openings, I think, should help us. But again, we will let you know. Hello? I think it's kind of what we would have done anyway. It certainly is because we now have the confidence that we can provide a better service at frankly a lower total price. Innovel was one of our suppliers that has always done a good job, as have some others. And as we build more volume on it and get more density, that too will allow us to lower the cost and lower the cost to our members. Certainly, with that and what we have seen again, I think if you had asked us four months ago, hey, we are going to have this big COVID thing and this is what's going to happen, we certainly didn't know that we would sell more big and bulky items. What were finding is, is because people are at home, notwithstanding some of the economic things of layoffs and furloughs, people are buying things for the house. We saw that again more recently with not related to big and bulky but lawn and garden. If you would have asked us two months ago, how is lawn and garden going to look, we would say it's going to not be very good because of all the economic issues. So I think at the end of the day, we are marketing additionally right now because we have the confidence that we can, we have seen the delivery times on certain big and bulky items improved dramatically on small groups of items as we onboard some of those items. It's a year-plus process. We would go back to mailings in June. Yes. For the most part, yes. Well, first of all, in terms of online sign-ups, a member that, again there are some members that aren't coming in or coming less frequently, to the extent they didn't come in the first part of this month and this is normally when they would come in and when they went to the checkout, it would notify them that they are up for renewal. They are now getting their email which they would have gotten, had they not renewed. And so that's pushing some of that way. Certainly, anecdotally, there have been plenty of people that have signed up to become members simply because of the one-day fresh or the two-day dry grocery. And so we are seeing a big push. I think it is too early to tell what happens in the future. I think more of it will go online just like everything else in life and we will do that. In terms of click and collect, we have very limited click and collect right now. It's in some of those high-value jewelry, small electronics. We did add pharmacy to it and that's not only click and collect, that's click and deliver through -- we are expanding. We are not everywhere yet with the benefit of Instacart. Tires, we are doing that where you could go online, order it and schedule it, schedule your tire installation. Photo. So we are doing more things. But if you are asking the question, to buy online and pickup in store in general, we are not looking at doing that on a regular product basis. We do delivery instead again through third parties in a big way as well as our own today. Karen, I missed the second part of the question. In terms of how do we feel our ability to pivot, look, if you go back two or three months ago, we were cutting orders, reducing orders recognizing there is going to be plenty of merchandise out there in these categories. Certainly for things like Christmas, I think we reduced the selection of a few things. And so a little more regular items than out there items. And now we are pivoting to try to get a few of those items, which are available. So frankly I think in some ways it's been easier for us because we have so many fewer SKUs and we are willing to try a few new things. And now, I didn't get the second part of your question. We are going to start doing some things in mid-June on a slow rollout basis in sampling. I can't tell you anymore but it's needless to say, not going to be where you go and just pick up an open sample with your fingers. But the sampling and both food and nonfood items are popular. And road shows as well. I think you will see a little more excitement on the road show side. So things that we can do to get people excited about coming in. On the second question, the latter question, I don't know. I am not up to speed on that in terms of lower prices. I would assume, that's what I have read in the paper in general. So I would assume we have some of that ability, recognizing we don't spend a lot to start with. And the first question was what? Repeat business? Yes, you know what? That's another one that I don't know off the top of my head. Sorry. Well, look, I mean food service related small business is down everywhere. It's been helped a little bit by some, we are less about serving the big restaurant chains but the mom-and-pop restaurants. And so that the takeouts in your neighborhood, the Japanese, the Chinese, the Thai, those types of things, they are doing some business. Arguably, what business we are losing on some of those things, we are gaining because you are eating at home. So overall, I think just in looking at fresh foods and the food items of what we call food and sundries, it's been way up, particularly in fresh foods and somewhat in the rest. So I think overall, we have been blessed. Now, the question beyond that is, what happens when everything opens up? I think it's going to be, the new normal is still going to take some time. You see on the news that even in states where it's been open, there's not everybody running to sit down. And then there's restrictions on how many people can be in a certain place at a given time. So again, having fresh foods has been certainly something that's been very positive for us. Well, yes, it fluctuates all over the board. Certainly it shows improvement when we add a country like we have Japan and Korea in the last couple of years. It certainly is down from its peak a few years back. Probably the biggest things are that getting back to traffic, traffic is down a little bit. The other thing is, one of things we do in store a lot is something we internally call e-blocks or electronic blocks. So based on when your membership is scanned, based on your historical purchases, it makes all the sense in the world for you to upgrade to be an executive member. We have chosen for the last couple few months not to do e-block because it's one-on-one direct contact with the member while they are waiting in line at the register. And so we probably, my guess would be a little higher and then we haven't a lot of warehouses year-to-date. So we will get back to normal on these things. But it does not raise a concern for us at all on this point. Well, we do what's called, we have always done it this way, a fully captured rate for renewal rate. So lets say you signed up originally in January. And so sometime in December, you get your renewal notice. And let's say, we ultimately get to that 90%, 91% renewal rate in the U.S. and Canada. By the end of January, you then draw the people that signed up in January, maybe by the end of January, I am making these numbers up here, at 75% and by the end of February you are at 82%, at the end of March you are at 85% and it takes, you might even get last 0.5% or 1% of that renewal rate six months out because if somebody that was a snowbird or somebody that just doesn't come in that often, there is always going to be that. In addition, whenever you have a group of new members, irrespective of whether it's online and in-store or in a new country, you have a lower renewal rate in that first respective year and then it builds each year over as year three becomes a combination of somebody renewing for the second time at a higher percentage than those that signed up originally in year two and were renewing for the first time in your three. So we don't know which direction. We know that we want to say that because we don't know where it's going to go. But the renewal rate right now is mostly related to stuff that happened four, five and six months ago and seven months ago. Well, first of all, from online, there is regular online which includes rather big ticket items. So I don't have the number in front of me but if in-store during regular times the average frontend transaction was in the $160 range, $140 range, I am sorry $140 range, online which include a lot of big ticket items was probably $300 to $400 range. As we have added two-day grocery, that number has come down. Certainly, while we don't again include in e-com the same day grocery that the likes of Instacart and others come in and do, that's going to be lower as well. So all these things are in flux right now. Again, I am happy to report that it is less than we braced for the worst case a few months ago or a couple months ago when we decided to raise some extra capital. Might we have to take things like seasonal apparel and seasonal lawn and garden and luggage, we do have some luggage to sell you, but it's a small category. But at the end of the day, all those things are less than we thought. So yes, there will be a small amount of items, probably in the few hundred to several hundred million dollars that will hold for a season or up to a year. But these are not things that are going out of style, even in items like apparel, which again I think we did, our buyers did a very good job of mitigating that impact initially with the suppliers. And also it's come back a little better than we thought. Not all the way back by any stretch but better than we thought. And in addition, we are not exactly high-fashion where things are going out of style. A lot of things that we have, whether it's some furniture items or apparel -- our senior merchant in the room is not pleased with that comment. But we are basic, we are fashion basic. We are not [indiscernible] about that. You know, I never looked at it. I mean it's a good question. We will have that for next time. Certainly, it's a lower percentage this quarter simply because of new members or people that cited, I mean I have friends that have chosen not to go physically anywhere and they are having things delivered and they love the same day fresh. So my guess, it's come down a little. Why don't we have two more questions? Yes. Overall, ex gas, overall it's very small. I am actually guessing because it's a lot more sales volume than there is inventory level. But on certain limited items, we have seen extreme examples were like eggs for a period of time. Some of the protein items like meat. But I would guess that it's impacting us a little less than others in some of those categories because of some of our supply relationships and strength but it depends and it's coming back now, it's coming down. So overall, I would say very little difference than it would have been. Well, keep in mind, Innovel is a business built over decades to serve Sears, it's owner. And Sears of course has come down dramatically over the last few years. And while I can't disclose all the numbers I am aware of, the component that was actually still servicing their needs had come down. And then also they had gone through their own reorganization as a retail company. And with that, I think they lost the business along the way. So you know, there is an infrastructure and a capacity in place, infrastructure in place with great capacity. And so we view this as an ability to do great things with. I think employees were 1,500. There is I think 11 large facilities, call it the roughly 800,000 to 1.2 million square foot facilities. And then about 105 smaller facilities which could be as small as 8,000 or 10,000 feet or as big as 50,000 or 60,000. And spread out generally serving I think 85% or 90% of the U.S. And again there's a lot of ability, it has a lot of capacity. And we were doing, we worked with them for five-plus years, I believe. But like anyone else working with them, we are doing a small piece of our business because we didn't know what was happening to the business as it's parent was going through it's on restructuring. Thank you. Last question. Well, the only thing I would pointed out earlier was, those businesses like optical, hearing aid, a reduced food court, those things was somewhere in the middle between one and two percentage points impact in Q3. Aside from that, when we went from generally closing Monday through Friday and 8:30, we went to I think 6:00. But we also added an hour in the morning for elderly and expanded that from two days to three days now to all five weekdays. We have not tried to quantify that. I can tell you that when we have had some very busy locations historically and we said let's add an hour in the morning or an hour later at night, what we found is, we tended to just spread the business. So I think the same thing here. There is not a lot of big impact other than our qualitative view was that there's a lot more impact from shelter in place and stay at home and come and get what you need and leave than there is from anything else. And again as that, I was encouraged by some of the things I have seen with a couple of the other retail apparel stores that have just started to open and are showing good numbers, because people are coming back. So I think that net net is encouraging. But I don't think it was a big impact to us either way. By the way, yes, there was and you noticed in our numbers, Canada was weaker than the U.S. In Canada and Quebec there's actually current and outstanding limitations of Sunday closes which is new over the last few months. And there is also I think been a little bit more stricter generally over up there, either stricter or people listening better to stay at home issues. And so we have seen, in a country where we are the only game in town in terms of warehouse clubs, we have seen weaker traffic and therefore slightly weaker numbers than the U.S. Well, again, putting on my blinders for a minute. Taiwan and China are the most encouraging. China, we have one location, of course, that's been open for less than a year. So we don't have a year-over-year comparison. Taiwan is quite strong. Japan is quite strong, maybe a few weeks behind that. We see Australia coming back. So overall, that gives us encouraging news for the U.S. and Canada. But part of that answer is, so what until we see it. Okay. Well, thank you everyone. And me and my guys here are around to answer questions. Have a good day."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Q2 Earnings Call and February Sales Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO. Thank you. Please go ahead. \nRichard Galanti: Thank you, Rochelle, and good morning to everyone -- good afternoon to everyone. I'll start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the 12 weeks ended this past February 16, as well as February retail sales results for the four weeks ended this past Sunday, March 1. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $931 million or $2.10 per share. This compared to last year's second quarter of $889 million or $2.01 per share. Net sales for the quarter came in at $38.26 billion, a 10.5% increase over the $34.63 billion realized last year in the quarter. Comparable sales for the second quarter were as follows: in the U.S., for the 12 weeks on a reported basis 9.1%, excluding gas inflation and the impacts of FX 8.1%; Canada, on a reported basis, 8.9%, ex-gas and FX, 6.8%; other international, 7.9% reported and 7.1% ex-gas and FX. For the total company a reported 8.9% same-store sales increase and ex-gas and FX of 7.9%. Both of those numbers were positively impacted as well by approximately 0.5%, due to the Thanksgiving holidays occurring one week later this year than last year. On e-commerce, we reported a 28.4% comp for the 12 weeks and a 28% ex-FX. And, again, there is the bigger impact of this Thanksgiving holiday shift there, given the importance of that to e-commerce. E-commerce sales in the quarter were positively impacted by an estimated 11 percentage points and hence the 28% comp result. In terms of second quarter comp sales metrics, second quarter traffic or shopping frequency increased 5.9% worldwide and 6.1% in the U.S. Strengthening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, positively impacted sales by about 0.25% -- I'm sorry, by about 25 basis points. And gasoline price inflation positively impacted these numbers by about 80 basis points. Our average transaction size or ticket was up 2.9% during the quarter, which includes the positive impacts of gas inflation and FX. Later in the call I'll review our February sales results. Moving down the income statement for the second quarter, membership fee income came in at $816 million or 6.3% higher than the $768 million recorded in Q2 of last year for a $48 million increase. That percent increase is about the same as it was Q1 year-over-year. In Q1, we opened three -- we had three new openings. In Q2 we had no new openings. In terms of renewal rates, at Q2 end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rates were -- came in at 90.9% and worldwide renewal rate at 88.4%. These are the same levels of renewal that we've achieved at each of the last two fiscal quarters. In terms of number of members at second quarter end, in terms of member households and total cardholders, at the end of second quarter, we had 55.3 million member households, up about 600,000 from the 54.7 million 12 weeks earlier. And total cardholders totaled 100.9 million, up about 1 million from the 99.9 million we reported at the end of the first quarter. At Q2 end, paid executive memberships stood at 21.7 million members, an increase of 321,000 during the 12 weeks or about 27,000 per week increase since Q1 end. Going down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin in the second quarter was lower year-over-year by 31 basis points coming in at 10.98% compared to 11.29% a year ago. That 31 basis point reduction lower number year-over-year excluding gas inflation, it would have been 22 basis points lower. If you'll please jump down to five -- four line items and two columns as we usually do. First column is reported for the second quarter and this actually would be without gas inflation. The core merchandise margin was down on a reported basis, 30 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. Ex-gas inflation was down 22. Ancillary businesses at minus five and a minus two basis points. 2% reward plus four and plus 2. And in total, as I mentioned, 31 basis points lower year-over-year on a reported basis and ex-gas inflation 22 basis points lower. The majority of the lower year-over-year core margin was driven by higher sales penetration of -- to significant lower-margin segments of our operations which are growing at a faster rate than the core, notably gasoline and e-commercial, as well as the start-up losses at our new poultry complex which I had mentioned in the first quarter as well. Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation to only their own -- to their sales, core and core, if you will, margins year-over-year were lower on a reported basis by 15 basis points of which six basis points related to the losses from the new poultry complex. Within the core gross margin year-over-year in Q2, we showed a gross margin increase in softlines, food and sundries was about even year-over-year, and decreases in both hardlines and fresh foods. Hardlines was down in the quarter primarily due to holiday timing which shifted more promotional activity into Q2 this year. Fresh was negatively impacted by our -- a step-up in price investments versus last year in fresh and by the margin impact from the new poultry complex as I just mentioned. And we're now halfway through our first year of operations of the poultry facility which opened on September 10th and we would expect the gross margin headwinds to decline, but -- continue, but to decline a little bit as we get to full production capacity and improve operations. Ancillary and other businesses gross margins, on a reported basis, minus five basis points year-over-year and minus two ex-gas inflation in the quarter. Basically you had a few things that hurt you and a few things that helped you, but overall minus 2% ex-gas inflation. 2% reward was better by four on a reported basis and by two basis points ex-gas inflation. This relates primarily to a true-up of our breakage estimate of the executive member rewards. Moving to SG&A, our reported SG&A percentage year-over-year was lower or better by 22 basis points, coming in at 9.78% of sales, down from 10.0% a year earlier. Without gas inflation, SG&A was lower by 13 basis points. Again if you jot down the following few numbers, four line items and the two columns, core operations year-over-year in Q2 on a reported basis showed an improvement. It was lower, so I'll say a plus 17 basis points and ex-gas inflation plus 10; central plus one and plus zero; stock compensation was lower, or plus four and plus three on ex-gas inflation. And again the total on a reported basis, SG&A was lower by 22 basis points plus 22; and without gas inflation plus 13, so lowered by 13. The core operations component, again 17 reported, 10 excluding impact from gas. This figure includes the impact of the wage increases that occurred last March of 2019. This hit our year-over-year comparison by an estimated three to four basis points. We anniversaried that increase just this past week, so the impact in Q3 will be minimal. SG&A also benefited during Q2 year-over-year from the shift of sales penetration to lower SG&A -- if you will lower SG&A segments of our operations, which are growing at a faster rate than the core. Again gas and e-com. Central was lower -- within SG&A, central was lower on a reported basis by one basis point or flat year-over-year ex-gas inflation. We continue to invest and spend in IT to the tune of about five basis points higher year-over-year. That was offset by improvement in other expense items and of course helped by strong sales. And stock comp as I mentioned on an ex-gas inflation improvement of three basis points. This varies quarter-to-quarter. Looking at the last couple of years generally it's a small hit in Q1 and flat to a small benefit in the other quarters, nothing really unusual to report there. Next on the income statement is pre-opening expense. Pre-opening expense was lower; it came in at $7 million compared to $2 million in Q2 a year ago. As I mentioned earlier, this year we had no openings. Last year we had two openings both in the U.S., one net new opening and one relo. This year's Q2 pre-opening expense in this quarter relates primarily to a warehouse that will open during the third and fourth fiscal quarters. Coming up very soon, our opening in Perth Australia and also our first in the state of Mississippi and Ridgeland Mississippi that will be our 45th state of -- where we operate. Those will both open during the next couple of weeks. All told, reported operating income in the second quarter of 2020 increased by 5.2% coming in at $1.266 billion this year, compared to $1.203 billion a year ago. Below the operating income line, interest expense was the same year-over-year coming in both quarters at $34 million. And interest income and other for the quarter was lower by $1 million so almost flat year-over-year. Overall pre-tax income was up 5.1% coming in at $1.277 billion compared to last year's $1.215 billion. In terms of income taxes, our rate was just slightly higher year-over-year. In the second quarter it was -- it came in at 25.9% rate compared to 25.8% in Q2 last year. For all of fiscal 2020 based on our current estimates, which of course are subject to change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total company tax rate to be approximately 26% to 26.5%. In terms of openings as I mentioned, we had no openings in Q2. We plan two net new openings in Q3. And I'll give you a range for Q4, which is our 16-week fiscal quarter of 11 to 13. Part of that, again most of the openings concentrated in our fourth fiscal quarter. And of course there's probably a few subject to slipping into early part of next year based on weather. As of Q2 end, total warehouse square footage stood at 114 million square feet. In terms of capital expenditures, during the quarter we spent approximately $545 million and our estimated CapEx for all of fiscal 2020 remains right around $3 billion. In terms of e-commerce, as again we reported a 28.4% comp sales increase and 28% without FX. Again a lot of that had to do -- a lot of that increase had to do with the Thanksgiving shift. We estimated again that about 11 percentage points of that related to Thanksgiving falling a week later this year and helping this number. Overall a few of the stronger departments, majors, special or kiosk items, seasonal and toys and housewares, these departments generally benefited from the holiday shift. In terms of total online grocery that continues to grow at a faster rate than the store comp both today and Instacart. The latter of which isn't included in our e-commerce numbers since they come into the warehouse to buy. Although the sales penetration is still very small, the sales are quite large in the high double-digit range year-over-year. During the second quarter we successfully launched both our Japan e-commerce site in December and our Australia e-commerce site this past month in February. And not to be outdone, we recently sold another high-value large carat diamond for a little over $600,000. If anyone's interested please give me your call. Turning to our February sales results, the four weeks ended this past Sunday, March 1 compared to the same period last year. As reported in our release, net sales for the month of February came in at $12.2 billion, a 13.8% increase from $10.72 billion a year ago. In terms of geography, U.S. reported comp to four weeks 12.4% ex-gas and FX 11.6%. Canada reported a 10.2% ex-gas and FX at 10.4%, other international a 12.5% ex-gas and FX of a 13.5%. So a total company at 12.1% reported and a 11.7% ex-gas and FX, e-comm for the 4-week period 22.6% for the reported and 22.7% ex-FX. Our February results benefited by last week's big uptick in sales, the fourth week of last month mostly we believe related to concerns around the coronavirus. This positively impacted amongst total and comparable sales numbers by approximately 3 percentage points. U.S. regions with a strong sales results in February were the Northwest Texas and the Midwest. Internationally in local currencies, we saw strong results in Taiwan, Japan, Spain and Mexico. For the month foreign currencies year-over-year relative to the dollar hurt Feb comp -- February comp's sales in Canada by about 60 basis points. It impacted negatively other international by about 110 basis points and total company by about 20 basis points. Cannibalization was about a 10 basis point impact to the U.S., so a minus 140 basis point minus impact to other international and 30 basis points overall to the company. Moving to merchandise highlights, the following comparable sales results by category: food and sundries were positive in the low teens. Strongest departments included foods, frozen food, sundries and candy. Hardlines were positive in the high singles. Better-performing departments were lawn and garden, health and beauty, aids and tires. Softlines were up in the mid-single digits. Better-performing departments included; housewares, domestics and jewelry. And finally fresh foods were up in the low double digits. Better-performing departments included; meat and produce. Within ancillary, pharmacy, gas and hearing aids had some of the better comp sales increases in February. Gas price inflation, I think I mentioned this positively impacted total reported comp sales by about 50 basis points. Lastly, our comp traffic or frequency for February was up 9.2% worldwide and 8.9% in the U. S. Now given the impact in week four, where we really saw the big uptick, as I know many did out there, related to the concerns over coronavirus, the first three weeks within that 9.2% worldwide for four weeks. The first three weeks stood at 7.6%. And again, within the 8.9%, U. S. frequency number for the four weeks within that for the three weeks it was 6. 9%. So still a good showing prior to that. For February the average transaction was up 2.7%. Now turning to the coronavirus and all the issues and impact surrounding it. Like everyone, we are keeping a close eye on the developments around the coronavirus including the impact on operations; the health and safety of our members and employees and of course our supply chain. As already discussed, we saw strength in our February traffic and comp sales related to the news and concerns about the virus, most particularly in the last week of the month and that's continuing in the first few days of this week. Our warehouses have overall remained open with only a few total days of closures at a couple of locations in Korea. As well our Shanghai location there's been some limitations required on the number of people in the facility at any given time. Members are turning to us for a variety of items associated with preparing for and dealing with a virus, such as shelf stable dry grocery items, cleaning supplies, Clorox and Bleach, water, paper goods, hand sanitizers, sanitizing wipes disinfectants, health and beauty aids and even items like water filtration and food storage items. And we're doing our best to stay in stock on these and other items. We're getting deliveries daily but still not enough given the increased levels of demand on certain key items. It's been a little crazy this past week in terms of outside shopping frequency and sales levels and not only in the United States. In terms of placing quantity limits on what a member can purchase. We are doing that in some instances. It tends to be at all locations but may differ regionally based on supply levels. I do want to give three big shout outs. Our buying staffs both here, regionally and abroad are working in some cases around the clock to procure supplies for both existing suppliers and from other sources where possible. Second, a shout out to our warehouse employees. These last nine or so days has been beyond busy. Even with the traffic jams and the parking lots and the long lines and to check out they've been absolutely awesome. And anecdotally we're hearing that daily from members. We have a few other things occasionally too. And lastly our suppliers both domestically and abroad, we feel our strong long-term relationships have helped to this crisis. We've been there for them and they are certainly there for us now. Overall, in terms of what the coronavirus-related demand items \u2013 in terms of that, it's looking better but not perfect and we'll see what each day brings. At our warehouses, in terms of cleanliness and sanitizing, we have enhanced sanitizing protocols and safety procedures have been implemented in all the locations. Some examples, wiping down car handles with sanitizing wipes, placing of sanitizing wipes stands at entrances also along the fresh line wall at food courts. Enhanced procedures at the food courts, patio tables, condiment tables, dispensers and bed et cetera. The general things you might expect and that we see in all the recommendations. In terms of supply chain, closures of many manufacturing facilities extended well beyond the typical one week Chinese New Year holiday, which was the last week in January. In many cases factories over there were closed for one to two additional weeks. That's now improving each week. Initially two to three weeks of factory \u2013 so initially there are two to three weeks of factory closures not one. Then about three weeks ago and just pulling some of the buyers that \u2013 a deal with the factories they felt there was a rough number of 20% to 25% production levels, moving up to 40% and now as high as 60% to 80%. But again, it's improving and this still has a little ways to go. In terms of transportation issues, whether it's Chinese New Year and then a couple of additional closure weeks. There were not only product issues, but also trucking and port issues. These are also abating with port capacity in China improving each day as well. And I say port capacity; it's also the shipping lines that come to the various ports. Domestically, truck capacity is plentiful. However, exporting items including KS items as well as other U.S. manufactured items to our locations in Asia and Australia. It's been a little bit of a challenge because of some container shortages here. But, overall, okay, it just taken a little more work. We're finding other ways to handle any potential out of stocks by shifting SKUs to alternative items and categories, particularly in the areas of domestic goods, food and sundries and fresh. And as you might expect, our travel business is impacted due to reduced demand, as well as higher-than-normal cancellations of previously booked trips, particularly as it relates to cruises and international travel. I don't think there's any surprise with that. At this point, it's hard to quantify what the financial impact will be for our future results -- to our future results. Again, the first week-and-a-half of this fiscal quarter, it's been -- the last week-and-a-half has been quite good with the sales, but we'll see what tomorrow brings. We'll continue to pass that information along and, of course, we do report monthly sales results. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our March sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, April 5, on Wednesday, April 8, after the market closes. With that, I will open it up to Q&A and turn it back over to Rochelle. Thank you.\nOperator: All right. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimeon Gutman: Hey, Richard. Can you hear me okay?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Yeah.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Good. Thank you. First question is on the gross margin. I think if we take the core-on-core down 15% and you get rid of the chicken production costs, you're down 9%. Did you say within that? What the e-commerce mix shift is? And how that compares to prior quarters up to the prior run rate? \nRichard Galanti: We weren't that specific, but a lot of it has to do with the fact that, that one -- particularly, that one week, where it's so important to e-commerce on promotional items, for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, the weekend, the three days leading up to Thanksgiving, so you do have some lower-margin -- you have some lower-margin categories in there to start with, as well as, we do a lot more promotional stuff, as most retailers do, with that week of Thanksgiving.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. So this was a little bit unusual, given the timing and given just the fourth quarter, or the holiday period was in that number?\nRichard Galanti: And I want to stand corrected, there's a couple of people here just correct me. The e-com numbers are not in the core-on-core. So that would be outside of that.\nSimeon Gutman: Got it. Okay. \nRichard Galanti: But it's still the strength in majors.\nSimeon Gutman: Right. Okay. Got it. But broadly speaking, the greater mix of e-com, Richard, is going to depress -- well, you're saying it's not in that number, but it's unfavorable to gross margin broadly, though, is that fair? And is that because of the mix of products that are being bought or because of the discounts or the markup that you're putting on those items.\nRichard Galanti: It's both. I mean, as we try to build new categories over the last year or so like apparel, we're giving some hot deals out there. If you buy one shirt, it's X if you buy two; it's a little less for delivery or whatever else. So, we're driving that business. And again we've talked about -- yes, but the big thing is electronics. Electronics tends to be a low-margin business not only TVs, but all the computer and phone things.\nSimeon Gutman: Got it. Okay. My follow-up is on just overall reinvestment, right? Your business is growing at a really high level, high single-digit comps. I'm not sure if you planned for that level and the core-on-core, in general, is doing relatively well. It's not down 20 or 30. And I guess the SG&A that you're spending seems somewhat in line. But I assume you're not flowing through all the leverage that's coming through this model. And so my question is where are you finding places to reinvest. Again it doesn't seem like the core-on-core is getting -- is going down enough to suggest you're putting it back in price. Are you finding other places to spend in SG&A?\nRichard Galanti: Well I'd argue that we are putting a lot of it back in price. Keep in mind of all the buckets we talked about historically from the membership fee income to the tax reform to the changing credit card, those things keep growing and it allows us to be competitive. And when we see strong sales, I think it encourages us to do more of that. And the other thing is I'm not going to go through 10 different things, but there's lots of things. We're very busy. It's not just the five basis points I mentioned in IT. We got a lot going on with the e-com fulfillment, with the chicken complex which I mentioned, there's a lot -- with the CCPA. These are small things but each of these are various numbers of basis points. CCPA is the privacy -- California Privacy Act. We don't point it out because I'm sure there's something that goes the other way sometimes. But at the end of the day, there's a lot of things going on and we feel pretty good about where our expenses are, in other words, we're going to try to improve them.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Melich from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nGregory Melich: Hi, thanks. Richard two things I wanted to follow-up. One is on the membership fee income could you give us what that is in constant currency. And also if you're seeing any membership sign-ups in Flex like the way sales and traffic have in the last couple of weeks?\nRichard Galanti: Its $2 million, is it? $2 million? It's $2 million even with FX.\nGregory Melich: Once we adjust for that. Got it. And then on the sign-ups, have you seen any change there in the rate of sign ups?\nRichard Galanti: I honestly don't know. I know even a few people -- I mean the shopping frequency is off the charts for the last few days. And you see it on social media with people sending in pictures. So, I've got to believe there's been a little bit of it but not enough to move the needle.\nGregory Melich: Got it. And then secondly was just on gasoline. What -- did you have the average selling price this quarter? And if you have any sort of trends on the gallons would be great as well.\nRichard Galanti: I don't have it in front of me. I know that there was -- gas was inflationary, correct? I think -- in Q2, it was 7.9% inflationary.\nGregory Melich: Inflationary. And that's the average selling price per gallon versus a year ago?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. $2.75 versus $2.55.\nGregory Melich: Got it. And then last I'll sneak in things. I know its coming. The balance sheet, very strong, more volatile markets, how should we think about buyback capital structure in the current rate environment and environment of the world?\nRichard Galanti: Well, every banker calls us every day to let us know that rates are even lower today time to borrow. But, no, look we continue to look at it. We talked about it in every Board meeting and all I can tell you is stay tuned.\nGregory Melich: All right. Thanks. Good luck guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nChris Horvers: Thanks. Good evening. So a few follow-ups. First on March, I mean you are limiting some of those high-volume items. It does look like you've got some pretty low in stocks out there. Do you see the potential for comp risk later this month?\nRichard Galanti: Well, we don't know. People have asked us what happens when people have been bulking up on certain items. And, yes, there's out of stocks every day too. But overall the numbers are incredible because there's so many people coming in. And they're buying other stuff as well. So I don't know what tomorrow brings. When asked the question, are the people then go through this additional purchasing of water and shelf-stable food items and everything, I guess it depends. Are some of them putting it in their basements for another day, some of it related to the fact that people aren't eating out as much. I think it's a combination of those factors. All we know is that last week starting Tuesday or Wednesday, which is when a lot of the news went even -- went -- in the U.S. went even further we had a huge pickup in traffic, which continued over the weekend and increased, and increased the first few days of this even further in the first few days of this month -- this week. And so we'll see what tomorrow brings. And again on the supply side, there is clearly not just -- at Costco and other places you really can't go in and generally find sanitizing items and what have you. And while we're getting shipments daily somewhere in the U.S. whatever limited amounts we get or allocated is gone pretty quickly. And I would assume that over the next few weeks or several weeks that will abate. But it depends what else happens with the virus itself. \nChris Horvers: Yeah. I was at a store on Saturday. I've never -- right after they open. I've never seen a line that all the way back to dairy. The -- my follow-up question is this might be hard to parse out, but I think the big question on investors' minds is how the consumer is going to behave. Obviously you have the pantry load, but you also sell a lot of general merchandise, you also sell a lot of big ticket. So were you able to tease out if you're seeing any pullback relative to trend in the past week or so in some of the more discretionary and larger ticket categories?\nRichard Galanti: Yeah. What's interesting, I'm just looking at some hand-written notes from our -- I spoke to our senior buyers yesterday. You would think things like patio furniture would be impacted because it's a big ticket discretionary items. The comment was we're selling it extremely well. Now part of that is we've got a bunch more people coming in, so maybe per customer -- the purchase per customer is down a little but there's a lot more customers. And so -- and -- what else lawn and garden is doing well. The buyers' view is that's more weather related in certain markets. There has been some impact in -- excuse me?\nChris Horvers: Did you say TV? Were you going to say TV?\nRichard Galanti: No lawn and garden are weather related. And then in some electronics items, while some are strong, there's others like some laptops and some phones where there's been some supply chain issues. But I would say, overall the initial thought -- my initial thought is that, big-ticket discretionary items might be negatively impacted right now. To the extent they are, it's been more than offset at least in these last several days by the influx of shopping frequency. I don't know what that means for tomorrow we'll have to see. \nChris Horvers: Understood and super helpful. And I'm sure all the media outlets are picking this a lot. My other question, two quick ones; one is, have you expanded the number of SKUs in the MVM. It seems to have picked up over the past couple of months, but wanted to get your thoughts there? And then lastly it looks like you have a new grocery delivery option in the app and on your website sort of an extended delivery option, not the 2-day and not the same day. So sort of what's been the strategy there? And is that new? Or just a repackaging of something you already have?\nRichard Galanti: Generally there's been no change in MVM items. I mean if it's up a little or down a little I think that's random not planned. And as it relates to shipping at least the people in the room with me here are not aware of that. Was it? \nChris Horvers: Okay. It must be just a repackaging of something that you already have. Yes. Okay, thanks very much. Best of luck.\nRichard Galanti: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.\nJohn Parke: This is actually John Parke on for Chuck. Can you guys provide a little bit of an update on the performance of same-day and Costco 2-day and how that's impacting kind of total spend from these customers that are utilizing it?\nRichard Galanti: It's still relatively new for us over the last year. Overall in -- my knowledge of this is a couple of months old. It's a slight improvement. The concern of course is as they buy more having delivered in one day and two day and then they come in less frequently. But how less frequently and they are coming in a little less regularly but the sum of the two still is fine. Again it's too early to tell in our view just fine continue? Or does it change a little bit. We're still -- but keep in mind also, we continue to do a lot of things consciously even through e-mails to get you come back in the location with certain promotional things that are in-store only.\nJohn Parke: Got it. And then I guess, just going back to the coronavirus. I mean, is there any way to kind of indicate whether the margin on these sales are materially different than your traditional shop?\nRichard Galanti: Food sundries overall is -- yes, it's about in line, I would say, on the company averages.\nJohn Parke: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open.\nKaren Short: Thank you so much. A couple of questions, you -- Richard, you commented on the fresh gross margin decline. And I'm wondering if you could just give a little bit of color on that, and that's obviously excluding the poultry. You kind of called that a step-up in price investments?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. We're just -- I mean, at the end of the day, our heart is we're merchants, and we try to drive business. And fresh is an area that also is a frequency driver. So it's more -- my comment is more anecdotal than some new change in strategy. \nKaren Short: But not necessarily -- also comment on the competitive landscape.\nRichard Galanti: No that is \u2013 the increased level of competition that I've talked about that goes back a year and a half plus ago. And that hasn't changed.\nKaren Short: Okay. And then can you just maybe clarify a little bit on the \u2013 I guess the true-up of the breakage estimates.\nRichard Galanti: Well, I mean at the end of the day it's a small amount of basis points. When we issue a significant amount \u2013 you can kind of back into the number yourself of what percentage of our sales are the 2% reward. And we send out those certificates and there's always going to be some slippage. Notwithstanding the fact that, we send out reminders to our members that you haven't cashed this. At the end of the day we tend to be \u2013 we do our best guess to accrue for slippage. And I'd like to think that we tend to be a little conservative. And therefore when there's a review it picks up the other way. But at the end of the day we \u2013 accounting rules say, you do your best guess of what it should be. And then when you re-review it you adjust that.\nKaren Short: Okay. And then I just want to switch gears to the Shanghai store and I think you said you you'll be opening a second one soon. But maybe any thoughts on what you think the actual annual volumes could and will settle out at for that store? And then any update on the number of members at that store since the last call. And then I mean, I ask it in the context that to the extent that China is an opportunity, it's not so much about the units. It's actually about the volume per unit.\nRichard Galanti: Right. Well, it's hard to say because this one is so off the charts. I mean, again the last few weeks \u2013 the last several weeks with some limitations on number of members for some of that period of time, it's changed a little bit. But I mean that was either a top or second largest location in our company for the several weeks leading up to that. And the number of members is again off the charts. Nearly five times the company.\nKaren Short: Okay. And but would we take that same number and apply that to the total revenue for that box? Or how should we think about that?\nRichard Galanti: No, no, no. Because given the population of Shanghai and the fact that this thing went throughout social media and it was very popular over there. You have a somewhat higher renewal rate, we don't know yet because we opened it in August. But we know from other countries \u2013 I'm sorry, lower \u2013 lower rental rate. And no and you can't just simply multiply that out. But our \u2013 but the unit overall is again either number one or two, up until the last few weeks with what's going on over there with coronavirus was one of our top two units.\nKaren Short: Okay. And then just last question for me. I don't think I've asked this for a while but do you have any \u2013 are you willing to give an update on what you think or what the \u2013 where the average ticket is in the U.S. of an executive member today versus just the basic membership and how that's trended in the last several years? Because it does seem like the momentum is really continuing to increase in terms of your share gains?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Look, we don't disclose that but more executive members and more penetration of executive members is good. More members who have the \u2013 in the case of the United States, the co-brand credit card is good. And if they have both in the executive and that it's even better. All those things I think are \u2013 help our sales growth.\nKaren Short: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nJohn Heinbockel: Richard, the price investments you mentioned in fresh food, was that actually proactive price investments or more delays in passing through vendor increases? And then, where those investments occurred, was that more protein as opposed to other categories?\nRichard Galanti: It's definitely proactive on our part. And, I think, it's all of the above. It's protein. It's fresh -- I mean its produce.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay. And then, if you -- I mean if you look at the fresh food comp, right, so I think you said low double-digit and that included the final week, right? So, that was the best fresh food comp you've had in a while. I don't know if you can parse out and maybe you can with -- looking at the final week, how much -- was some of that coronavirus related, or was a lot of that step-up related to the price investments?\nRichard Galanti: Who knows? Clearly, week four was different than weeks one, two and three, for everything. And just a sheer number of people coming into the warehouse. I personally believe that given that restaurants probably have been impacted a little bit the last couple of weeks. They're buying more at supermarkets and more at Costco, so those things help a little bit as well.\nJohn Heinbockel: And then, lastly, when you think about it -- and I know you said the margin on some of that stuff is sort of in line with the average. When you think about the -- sort of, the cost associated with restocking and dealing with that volume and you think about, I don't know, an EBIT margin tied to the volume. Normally, the EBIT margin will be -- the incremental margin will be a lot higher. Is that less the case here because of the cost required to keep up with that volume?\nRichard Galanti: Well, yeah, I think, there's a lot of additional things that cost you. I mean, there's not a lot of it, but I'm sure there's a little air freight going on. And I'm sure there's -- when you've got a high-cube, high-weight, low-value items like water, for the hectoliter it's for $2.99 or something, and you're going through it faster than you could put it on the floor. There's more labor and everything else. But it's still a net positive. In the scheme of things, I don't know if it helps or hurts the bottom a little bit. So. Okay. Yes. And the other thing is, they're not just coming and getting those five items and moving. They're shopping a little bit. Again, I personally was surprised that patio furniture is strong. And maybe per person it's a little weaker, but there's a lot more persons.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Baker from Nomura. Your line is open.\nMike Baker: Okay. Thanks. A couple of questions. One, can you tell us how gas profits were this year versus last year. And then, remind us if you could, how much that helped 2Q, 2019, versus 2Q, 2018.\nRichard Galanti: I believe -- I don't have it in front of me, but I believe last year we said gas helped us, relative to the prior year. It was pretty -- it wasn't worth talking about, plus or minus either way. \nMike Baker: Okay.\nRichard Galanti: This year versus last.\nMike Baker: Got it. Okay. Shifting gears a couple more, if I could. So, February, even if you take out -- first of all, the 300 basis points, can we take that out pro rata across international and the U.S.? Or is it that impacts one region more than the other? And the real question is, when you strip that out, February was much stronger than you've been running, even so? In other words, I presume the first three weeks were strong. So what do you think is behind that uptick, even before you got to week four?\nRichard Galanti: It must be those investments in price. No, at the end of the day it is generally around the world. I think Korea has been a little less of that probably a little less of that benefit. But there's been -- there was an outbreak there that had a lot of publicity and I think there were more people perhaps staying home are not going out. The -- but when I look at U.S., Canada, and several other countries, all of them had big upticks in that last -- the past nine or so days. And I'm sorry what was the last part of the question?\nMike Baker: Just why do you think weeks one -- so weeks one, two and three were obviously strong as well because when you take out that 300 basis points, it's still -- you're high single digits. So, what do you think is behind that big uptick?\nRichard Galanti: There's probably lots of little things I'd like -- my mother would say we're good merchants and great stuff at low prices. There's nothing that stands out completely. And certainly there was not a lot of press out there issues around coronavirus even though was in the news a little bit. So, maybe on a macro basis, there's a little bit of that in there. I think there may have been some weather issues a year ago that may have impacted a little. But overall, we were -- in those three weeks, forgetting about week four, which was off the charts, it was -- we're feeling pretty good about it that some of the stuff we're doing is working from a merchandising standpoint and a pricing standpoint.\nMike Baker: Okay, fair enough. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nRupesh Parikh: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions and thanks for all the comments on the coronavirus. So, I guess, Richard, just going back to your commentary on the supply chain. So, as you guys look forward, at this point, do you expect any impact on your supply chain-related to coronavirus or is it too early to tell earlier in the year?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think -- first of all, there has been an impact on it. It's now starting to get a little bit further than normal back to normal on regular stuff. On some of the virus-related items that people are buying like water and sanitizing items and paper tiles and things like that, that's going to take a little bit while longer. When I ask the buyers they're working day-to-day with suppliers. You've got suppliers that are literally working around the clock to produce and to ship. But again people are coming in and buying stuff, if you will, for their basement.\nRupesh Parikh: And what about -- I guess I was asking more on some of the other categories like electronics. And some of those categories that may come from Asia. Just curious if you expect an impact?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think I mentioned there have been -- we have seen some little impact on some laptops and some cell phones and I think that's related to some of the things that we all read about in the paper about some shortage -- some delays because of some of the component parts. I think one thing that helps us a little as we're able to pivot a little bit. So, if there was a shortage or something with one area, we're able to put something else in its place since we sell pretty much everything. But we just don't know what's going to happen tomorrow. First order of business is to get the supply chains back open and running well. There are two kinds of supply chain issues. There's a supply chain issue related to all these very high demand items related to fighting and protecting yourself; the waters, the sanitizing, and things like that. And then there's just stuff, I mean everything from furniture to apparel to electronics coming from China. And on the latter, it seems at least while the one week -- and keep in mind given, the planned Chinese New Year week, there were stuff bought in early not only by us, but I'm sure others and so -- but then there's two more weeks of closures. So, those kind of things over the last three weeks in terms of talking about buyers, the supply chain has -- and the manufacturers are now back open they went from zero if you will the 25% to 40% to 50% to 60%, 80% and now it's getting to the ports. And some of those things are also being abated, some of the issues there. So my guess is if everything got better tomorrow from a concern standpoint, you still have a few weeks here where it takes time to fill those supply chains.\nRupesh Parikh: Great. And one follow-up question. Just on the holiday season. You guys had a really strong performance even with fewer selling days, so just curious if there's any surprises or what do you think contributed to the really strong outperformance?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think we -- this is -- that's what we do. I mean, I think we've done a great job. We've been helped by strong big-ticket categories like electronics, like patio furniture and lawn and garden right now and other hardlines and softlines areas. Fresh continues to drive our business. We -- as you know when we're asked what are the two or three big factors that drive our business -- or of categories. It's fresh, it's gas, it's executive membership. And again utilizing those different bucket -- even when sales are good, we want to be aggressive in pricing. And when sales are bad, we want to be aggressive more aggressive in pricing. When the sales are good, we want to be more aggressive in pricing. It drives -- the top line improvements drive the bottom line.\nRupesh Parikh: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good afternoon, guys. Richard, you talked about expecting margin pressure to moderate a bit from the poultry plant ramp. And I know there was an incubation period there. So is that plant actually turning out product at this point? And related to that can you give us an idea of what the incremental benefit you guys are expecting once you're in full production mode?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think it was mid-September when we -- when the first chicken went through the plan if you will. The plan was that 45 weeks later there would be approximately 2.2 million birds a week being processed. And so call it September to August. And so we're a little bit past the halfway mark on that. And I believe in terms of production, we're a little bit past the halfway mark on that. Call it one million birds a week. It should be off a little bit on either side. And so a lot of this has to do with the fact that you've got this big facility that is running at well below capacity. The amount of impairment to margin related to that in Q2 was less than Q1. We would expect it to be less than in Q3 and further. So once we get the full capacity I think -- and then I'm sure there's going to be some operational improvements over the first couple of years as well. At the end of the day, it's a combination of sourcing just simpler supply. And our view is, is we can improve if you will the ultimate cost per bird. But we don't know that yet. We spent a little more than we planned, but we also upgraded the facility to be air chilled instead of water chilled. It truly is a state-of-the-art facility for the U.S. and a very high volume facility. And I would say, right now, things are going as planned in terms of that 45-week cycle. And I would like to think that a year from now -- six months from now or two more quarters from now, it's not going to be an issue that we really even talk about as it relates to how it impacted margin.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got you. I appreciate that.\nRichard Galanti: A little bit. I don't think it'll be that wrong. \nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. And then I know you obviously had the surge in that kind of fourth week, as you pointed out, because of the coronavirus. Warehouses were obviously jammed. Everyone kind of sees that. But I'm curious if you happen to see an even larger increase from e-comm in terms of -- like has there been some sort of shift in consumer behavior at all? Or is all the activity concentrated on warehouses? \nRichard Galanti: No. I mean we saw an increase but not really. I mean mind you that -- we saw -- yes throughout February we saw some increase in e-commerce. But again if people are looking for those -- the sense of urgency I'm going out right now and get it in things like water and everything. And some of those key items like peanut butter and crackers and the like, we have online as well. And those too in some regions there might be in and out of stocks.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. All right, thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line Judah Frommer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJudah Frommer: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was hoping maybe you could help us with kind of how things trended in Korea over the last few weeks. You have exposure there potentially weeks ahead of where the U.S. could be worst-case scenario for the virus. So in terms of demand and kind of stock up and then potentially demand falling off as the virus spread there any insights there?\nRichard Galanti: Well I think the only insight is -- from what I've read it is not -- is the issue that more people are staying at home and not even going out. Whereas even near the -- I love the publicity that the state of Washington and King County is getting with a few of the -- there are people out and about. There's a little less traffic on the highways. And -- but notwithstanding that that's some highways coming to see us. \nJudah Frommer: Got it. And then kind of changing gears. We've seen some stuff about potentially requiring membership and some food courts in the press, anything behind the thought process there? \nRichard Galanti: Well first of all, it's gotten more press than it deserves. There are I believe seven current locations on the West Coast where we -- and I believe they are all outdoor locations. And one of the challenges that we've had is, particularly on very busy locations where people that are non members just come and eat there every day. You've got member complaints saying, why are you -- I have to pay the come to Costco. And so we took -- we're testing it in seven locations that we are limiting it to members only. It's easy in locations where you have the food court inside. But on -- and many of the ones in areas where the weather is generally good like California, Arizona and things like that you have a lot of them are outside. And so we'll see. But that's -- but again, seven locations out of 540, we're testing it at and it's gotten a lot of press. \nJudah Frommer: Okay, got it. And if I could squeeze in one more, anything on supply in pharmacy and any people stocking up there and potentially running out of inventory?\nRichard Galanti: This is just a quote from the FDA yesterday and said well the FDA and other outlets are reporting disruptions and medical products are possible. At this time manufacturers are reporting that no specific drugs are experienced in shortage due to the impact of COVID-19. And talking to our Head of Pharmacy yesterday, he said the only thing that we've seen there's been a little pickup there as well. Let's say somebody has a year-long prescription. So four nine -- a prescription plus 990-day refills for -- and they'll come in and they'll want all four of them filled now. And in some cases even when their particular insurance plan doesn't cover it, they're paying cash. They're just hoarding -- they're hoarding up on their prescription to make sure we're not running out. But that's more again, I think the same thing you're seeing with paper goods. But from a supply and availability standpoint, but we haven't seen anything yet.\nJudah Frommer: Okay. Thanks.\nRichard Galanti: Why don't we take two more questions.\nOperator: Okay. Next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen. Your line is open.\nOliver Chen: Hi, Richard, regarding the supply chain and what you're seeing, what are your thoughts regarding the price increases or potential price increases, whether that be from transportation costs or other and what your buyers think may happen there. And the second question is related to e-commerce. You made a lot of progress on your mobile app. Just what's ahead for changes to the mobile app? And also more broadly, capital investments related to e-comm and supply chain? Thank you.\nRichard Galanti: As it relates to costs, the general view of the buyers is, is that we have \u2013 I get back to the comment I made earlier about strong relations. To the extent that there's some raw materials cost increases because of shortages, that's going to rain on everybody. In our view, it rains on us a little less. But I think we \u2013 given the limited number of items we buy and the amount of things we \u2013 the amount of any given item that we buy, our buyers, we feel, know a lot more about the cost structure. And so I haven't seen any commentary on that internally other than there was one small comment I can't find it in my mess of papers here, that there may be \u2013 in some small cases, some raw material increases on some particular item \u2013 some particular raw material for some manufacturing process. But overall, there's not been a big issue. Right now, the only increase in transportation has some very limited items where there's been a little bit of airfreight, what we're finding is, is that the ports are getting back to capacity and there's plenty of space. And so that's not been as big an issue. As it relates to an e-comm investment. There's not a lot I have my plate to tell you today, we're working on more things related to our app, to our membership digital app. And we certainly have some things going on on the fulfillment side of e-commerce. And we've been focused on getting two more countries opened, as I mentioned in the last quarter. And we think \u2013 there are a few other things that we've got going on that I'll be happy to chat with the next time around.\nOliver Chen: Okay. And is buy online, pick up in-store going as you like? And do you expect a lot of enhancements ahead to that as customers like it? \nRichard Galanti: Well, customers like it, but we don't like it necessarily. We're doing buy online and pick up in-store for some small items \u2013 small high-value items. But we're not at the point where we're looking for members to buy online they come up and pick up their whole grocery baskets. So we're trying to figure out our way. And certainly \u2013 again, the last nine or so days notwithstanding, seems \u2013 things seem to be working pretty well for us in that regard. We continue to work on the \u2013 where we've had good sales and good strength over the last few years in e-commerce is taking certain big and bulky things out of the warehouse, white goods and things that are delivered, in some cases, installed, and so we continue to work on those kind of things as well.\nOliver Chen: And lastly, Richard, with the surge in demand and the traffic trends that you've seen, how have you managed, like, this customer and guest satisfaction and also labor in your stores, those kinds of things that we're curious about?\nRichard Galanti: How do we measure it?\nOliver Chen: How have you managed it? And just -- and tried your best to make sure that customers are happy. And also, you have the appropriate labor levels, relative to spikes and changes in demand.\nRichard Galanti: Well, again, the last week-and-a-half notwithstanding, because it's been nuts. No, first of all, member comments and basic member renewal rates. I mean, we actually -- the operators and all the way up to Craig, see weekly information on comments. You can't imagine how many people call and e-mail when to have something that they're concerned about. And we also measure the least expected, but the positive letters to that effect. On the operations side, the key is still -- well, aside from merchandising, the art of merchandising out there and giving the warehouse managers the assistant managers and the merchandisers -- whereas merchandisers some leeway, not -- I mean, certainly electronics is when you walk in and there's defensive promotional goods and fresh is in the back. But the end of the day, there is a bit of merchandising that is pushed down to the regional and warehouse level. And that's what, I think, drives our business there. In terms of the front end, managing the front end, I think, we've got less count, 120 of our 540-ish locations in the U.S. with self-checkout. And we plan another 100 in the next three months. And so, always trying to figure out and measuring the number of transact -- number of member transactions through the front end per hour.\nOliver Chen: Great. Thank you. Best regards. Great job.\nOperator: Next question from the line of Peter Benedict from Baird. Your line is open.\nPeter Benedict: Hey, Richard, just two quick ones here to close out. So, it looks like the business probably comping in the 20% range there in that last week and, certainly, the demand is probably even higher than that, just given that you guys are running out towards the end of the day. How do you think about the ability for the club to kind of keep up that pace -- with that pace of demand? I mean, if this were to go on for three, four more weeks. Do you guys think you've got the supply chain able to keep up with that level of demand? Or are you hitting a point where you're not -- you're just not going to get another delivery tomorrow of pick your category?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. No. Well, I think, it's all over the board. Yesterday, I think, there was a couple of -- either Los Angeles or San Diego counties that announced a heightened level of concern. King County here in Seattle did that a couple of days ago. When that happens, that's another catalyst to puts people to go out and get more stuff. I would hope -- and, look, we would all hope this thing peaks and starts to slow down. It depends what happens tomorrow. We'll be tired, but still working hard. Given that half of our employees -- roughly -- a little over half of our -- of the 90% of employees in our warehouses that are hourly, about a little over half of those 90% are full-time and a little under half of are part-time. Certainly, there are employees that want to work more than part-time and so we've been able to accommodate some additional hours there. But everybody is a little tired but that's what you do.\nPeter Benedict: Okay. And then my last question is just on lawn and garden, you mentioned that a couple of times and you talked about seasonal. Maybe expand on that a little bit. Where in particular are you seeing the strong -- I guess, it's an early start to spring, but maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing on that front?\nRichard Galanti: Well, the only thing I mentioned there was that in -- and getting ready for today's call, I had spoken to several of the senior merchants in the different categories. And one thing without even looking at the numbers I thought is I assume some of the big ticket discretionary items might be a little weaker because people are not running in to get those items. They're running in to get other concerned items. And the fact was to my surprise that they said that certain items like patio furniture and lawn and garden was strong. They felt -- and again it was just their view that patio -- lawn and garden was more related to some of the areas of the country where the weather has turned already. And -- but clearly because you got X percent more people coming in every day than normal.\nPeter Benedict: That makes sense. Fair enough. Thanks so much.\nRichard Galanti: Okay. Well thank you everyone. Have a good afternoon and we're around to answer any questions. Have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Galanti",
            "content": "Thank you, Rochelle, and good morning to everyone -- good afternoon to everyone. I'll start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the 12 weeks ended this past February 16, as well as February retail sales results for the four weeks ended this past Sunday, March 1. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $931 million or $2.10 per share. This compared to last year's second quarter of $889 million or $2.01 per share. Net sales for the quarter came in at $38.26 billion, a 10.5% increase over the $34.63 billion realized last year in the quarter. Comparable sales for the second quarter were as follows: in the U.S., for the 12 weeks on a reported basis 9.1%, excluding gas inflation and the impacts of FX 8.1%; Canada, on a reported basis, 8.9%, ex-gas and FX, 6.8%; other international, 7.9% reported and 7.1% ex-gas and FX. For the total company a reported 8.9% same-store sales increase and ex-gas and FX of 7.9%. Both of those numbers were positively impacted as well by approximately 0.5%, due to the Thanksgiving holidays occurring one week later this year than last year. On e-commerce, we reported a 28.4% comp for the 12 weeks and a 28% ex-FX. And, again, there is the bigger impact of this Thanksgiving holiday shift there, given the importance of that to e-commerce. E-commerce sales in the quarter were positively impacted by an estimated 11 percentage points and hence the 28% comp result. In terms of second quarter comp sales metrics, second quarter traffic or shopping frequency increased 5.9% worldwide and 6.1% in the U.S. Strengthening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, positively impacted sales by about 0.25% -- I'm sorry, by about 25 basis points. And gasoline price inflation positively impacted these numbers by about 80 basis points. Our average transaction size or ticket was up 2.9% during the quarter, which includes the positive impacts of gas inflation and FX. Later in the call I'll review our February sales results. Moving down the income statement for the second quarter, membership fee income came in at $816 million or 6.3% higher than the $768 million recorded in Q2 of last year for a $48 million increase. That percent increase is about the same as it was Q1 year-over-year. In Q1, we opened three -- we had three new openings. In Q2 we had no new openings. In terms of renewal rates, at Q2 end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rates were -- came in at 90.9% and worldwide renewal rate at 88.4%. These are the same levels of renewal that we've achieved at each of the last two fiscal quarters. In terms of number of members at second quarter end, in terms of member households and total cardholders, at the end of second quarter, we had 55.3 million member households, up about 600,000 from the 54.7 million 12 weeks earlier. And total cardholders totaled 100.9 million, up about 1 million from the 99.9 million we reported at the end of the first quarter. At Q2 end, paid executive memberships stood at 21.7 million members, an increase of 321,000 during the 12 weeks or about 27,000 per week increase since Q1 end. Going down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin in the second quarter was lower year-over-year by 31 basis points coming in at 10.98% compared to 11.29% a year ago. That 31 basis point reduction lower number year-over-year excluding gas inflation, it would have been 22 basis points lower. If you'll please jump down to five -- four line items and two columns as we usually do. First column is reported for the second quarter and this actually would be without gas inflation. The core merchandise margin was down on a reported basis, 30 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. Ex-gas inflation was down 22. Ancillary businesses at minus five and a minus two basis points. 2% reward plus four and plus 2. And in total, as I mentioned, 31 basis points lower year-over-year on a reported basis and ex-gas inflation 22 basis points lower. The majority of the lower year-over-year core margin was driven by higher sales penetration of -- to significant lower-margin segments of our operations which are growing at a faster rate than the core, notably gasoline and e-commercial, as well as the start-up losses at our new poultry complex which I had mentioned in the first quarter as well. Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation to only their own -- to their sales, core and core, if you will, margins year-over-year were lower on a reported basis by 15 basis points of which six basis points related to the losses from the new poultry complex. Within the core gross margin year-over-year in Q2, we showed a gross margin increase in softlines, food and sundries was about even year-over-year, and decreases in both hardlines and fresh foods. Hardlines was down in the quarter primarily due to holiday timing which shifted more promotional activity into Q2 this year. Fresh was negatively impacted by our -- a step-up in price investments versus last year in fresh and by the margin impact from the new poultry complex as I just mentioned. And we're now halfway through our first year of operations of the poultry facility which opened on September 10th and we would expect the gross margin headwinds to decline, but -- continue, but to decline a little bit as we get to full production capacity and improve operations. Ancillary and other businesses gross margins, on a reported basis, minus five basis points year-over-year and minus two ex-gas inflation in the quarter. Basically you had a few things that hurt you and a few things that helped you, but overall minus 2% ex-gas inflation. 2% reward was better by four on a reported basis and by two basis points ex-gas inflation. This relates primarily to a true-up of our breakage estimate of the executive member rewards. Moving to SG&A, our reported SG&A percentage year-over-year was lower or better by 22 basis points, coming in at 9.78% of sales, down from 10.0% a year earlier. Without gas inflation, SG&A was lower by 13 basis points. Again if you jot down the following few numbers, four line items and the two columns, core operations year-over-year in Q2 on a reported basis showed an improvement. It was lower, so I'll say a plus 17 basis points and ex-gas inflation plus 10; central plus one and plus zero; stock compensation was lower, or plus four and plus three on ex-gas inflation. And again the total on a reported basis, SG&A was lower by 22 basis points plus 22; and without gas inflation plus 13, so lowered by 13. The core operations component, again 17 reported, 10 excluding impact from gas. This figure includes the impact of the wage increases that occurred last March of 2019. This hit our year-over-year comparison by an estimated three to four basis points. We anniversaried that increase just this past week, so the impact in Q3 will be minimal. SG&A also benefited during Q2 year-over-year from the shift of sales penetration to lower SG&A -- if you will lower SG&A segments of our operations, which are growing at a faster rate than the core. Again gas and e-com. Central was lower -- within SG&A, central was lower on a reported basis by one basis point or flat year-over-year ex-gas inflation. We continue to invest and spend in IT to the tune of about five basis points higher year-over-year. That was offset by improvement in other expense items and of course helped by strong sales. And stock comp as I mentioned on an ex-gas inflation improvement of three basis points. This varies quarter-to-quarter. Looking at the last couple of years generally it's a small hit in Q1 and flat to a small benefit in the other quarters, nothing really unusual to report there. Next on the income statement is pre-opening expense. Pre-opening expense was lower; it came in at $7 million compared to $2 million in Q2 a year ago. As I mentioned earlier, this year we had no openings. Last year we had two openings both in the U.S., one net new opening and one relo. This year's Q2 pre-opening expense in this quarter relates primarily to a warehouse that will open during the third and fourth fiscal quarters. Coming up very soon, our opening in Perth Australia and also our first in the state of Mississippi and Ridgeland Mississippi that will be our 45th state of -- where we operate. Those will both open during the next couple of weeks. All told, reported operating income in the second quarter of 2020 increased by 5.2% coming in at $1.266 billion this year, compared to $1.203 billion a year ago. Below the operating income line, interest expense was the same year-over-year coming in both quarters at $34 million. And interest income and other for the quarter was lower by $1 million so almost flat year-over-year. Overall pre-tax income was up 5.1% coming in at $1.277 billion compared to last year's $1.215 billion. In terms of income taxes, our rate was just slightly higher year-over-year. In the second quarter it was -- it came in at 25.9% rate compared to 25.8% in Q2 last year. For all of fiscal 2020 based on our current estimates, which of course are subject to change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total company tax rate to be approximately 26% to 26.5%. In terms of openings as I mentioned, we had no openings in Q2. We plan two net new openings in Q3. And I'll give you a range for Q4, which is our 16-week fiscal quarter of 11 to 13. Part of that, again most of the openings concentrated in our fourth fiscal quarter. And of course there's probably a few subject to slipping into early part of next year based on weather. As of Q2 end, total warehouse square footage stood at 114 million square feet. In terms of capital expenditures, during the quarter we spent approximately $545 million and our estimated CapEx for all of fiscal 2020 remains right around $3 billion. In terms of e-commerce, as again we reported a 28.4% comp sales increase and 28% without FX. Again a lot of that had to do -- a lot of that increase had to do with the Thanksgiving shift. We estimated again that about 11 percentage points of that related to Thanksgiving falling a week later this year and helping this number. Overall a few of the stronger departments, majors, special or kiosk items, seasonal and toys and housewares, these departments generally benefited from the holiday shift. In terms of total online grocery that continues to grow at a faster rate than the store comp both today and Instacart. The latter of which isn't included in our e-commerce numbers since they come into the warehouse to buy. Although the sales penetration is still very small, the sales are quite large in the high double-digit range year-over-year. During the second quarter we successfully launched both our Japan e-commerce site in December and our Australia e-commerce site this past month in February. And not to be outdone, we recently sold another high-value large carat diamond for a little over $600,000. If anyone's interested please give me your call. Turning to our February sales results, the four weeks ended this past Sunday, March 1 compared to the same period last year. As reported in our release, net sales for the month of February came in at $12.2 billion, a 13.8% increase from $10.72 billion a year ago. In terms of geography, U.S. reported comp to four weeks 12.4% ex-gas and FX 11.6%. Canada reported a 10.2% ex-gas and FX at 10.4%, other international a 12.5% ex-gas and FX of a 13.5%. So a total company at 12.1% reported and a 11.7% ex-gas and FX, e-comm for the 4-week period 22.6% for the reported and 22.7% ex-FX. Our February results benefited by last week's big uptick in sales, the fourth week of last month mostly we believe related to concerns around the coronavirus. This positively impacted amongst total and comparable sales numbers by approximately 3 percentage points. U.S. regions with a strong sales results in February were the Northwest Texas and the Midwest. Internationally in local currencies, we saw strong results in Taiwan, Japan, Spain and Mexico. For the month foreign currencies year-over-year relative to the dollar hurt Feb comp -- February comp's sales in Canada by about 60 basis points. It impacted negatively other international by about 110 basis points and total company by about 20 basis points. Cannibalization was about a 10 basis point impact to the U.S., so a minus 140 basis point minus impact to other international and 30 basis points overall to the company. Moving to merchandise highlights, the following comparable sales results by category: food and sundries were positive in the low teens. Strongest departments included foods, frozen food, sundries and candy. Hardlines were positive in the high singles. Better-performing departments were lawn and garden, health and beauty, aids and tires. Softlines were up in the mid-single digits. Better-performing departments included; housewares, domestics and jewelry. And finally fresh foods were up in the low double digits. Better-performing departments included; meat and produce. Within ancillary, pharmacy, gas and hearing aids had some of the better comp sales increases in February. Gas price inflation, I think I mentioned this positively impacted total reported comp sales by about 50 basis points. Lastly, our comp traffic or frequency for February was up 9.2% worldwide and 8.9% in the U. S. Now given the impact in week four, where we really saw the big uptick, as I know many did out there, related to the concerns over coronavirus, the first three weeks within that 9.2% worldwide for four weeks. The first three weeks stood at 7.6%. And again, within the 8.9%, U. S. frequency number for the four weeks within that for the three weeks it was 6. 9%. So still a good showing prior to that. For February the average transaction was up 2.7%. Now turning to the coronavirus and all the issues and impact surrounding it. Like everyone, we are keeping a close eye on the developments around the coronavirus including the impact on operations; the health and safety of our members and employees and of course our supply chain. As already discussed, we saw strength in our February traffic and comp sales related to the news and concerns about the virus, most particularly in the last week of the month and that's continuing in the first few days of this week. Our warehouses have overall remained open with only a few total days of closures at a couple of locations in Korea. As well our Shanghai location there's been some limitations required on the number of people in the facility at any given time. Members are turning to us for a variety of items associated with preparing for and dealing with a virus, such as shelf stable dry grocery items, cleaning supplies, Clorox and Bleach, water, paper goods, hand sanitizers, sanitizing wipes disinfectants, health and beauty aids and even items like water filtration and food storage items. And we're doing our best to stay in stock on these and other items. We're getting deliveries daily but still not enough given the increased levels of demand on certain key items. It's been a little crazy this past week in terms of outside shopping frequency and sales levels and not only in the United States. In terms of placing quantity limits on what a member can purchase. We are doing that in some instances. It tends to be at all locations but may differ regionally based on supply levels. I do want to give three big shout outs. Our buying staffs both here, regionally and abroad are working in some cases around the clock to procure supplies for both existing suppliers and from other sources where possible. Second, a shout out to our warehouse employees. These last nine or so days has been beyond busy. Even with the traffic jams and the parking lots and the long lines and to check out they've been absolutely awesome. And anecdotally we're hearing that daily from members. We have a few other things occasionally too. And lastly our suppliers both domestically and abroad, we feel our strong long-term relationships have helped to this crisis. We've been there for them and they are certainly there for us now. Overall, in terms of what the coronavirus-related demand items \u2013 in terms of that, it's looking better but not perfect and we'll see what each day brings. At our warehouses, in terms of cleanliness and sanitizing, we have enhanced sanitizing protocols and safety procedures have been implemented in all the locations. Some examples, wiping down car handles with sanitizing wipes, placing of sanitizing wipes stands at entrances also along the fresh line wall at food courts. Enhanced procedures at the food courts, patio tables, condiment tables, dispensers and bed et cetera. The general things you might expect and that we see in all the recommendations. In terms of supply chain, closures of many manufacturing facilities extended well beyond the typical one week Chinese New Year holiday, which was the last week in January. In many cases factories over there were closed for one to two additional weeks. That's now improving each week. Initially two to three weeks of factory \u2013 so initially there are two to three weeks of factory closures not one. Then about three weeks ago and just pulling some of the buyers that \u2013 a deal with the factories they felt there was a rough number of 20% to 25% production levels, moving up to 40% and now as high as 60% to 80%. But again, it's improving and this still has a little ways to go. In terms of transportation issues, whether it's Chinese New Year and then a couple of additional closure weeks. There were not only product issues, but also trucking and port issues. These are also abating with port capacity in China improving each day as well. And I say port capacity; it's also the shipping lines that come to the various ports. Domestically, truck capacity is plentiful. However, exporting items including KS items as well as other U.S. manufactured items to our locations in Asia and Australia. It's been a little bit of a challenge because of some container shortages here. But, overall, okay, it just taken a little more work. We're finding other ways to handle any potential out of stocks by shifting SKUs to alternative items and categories, particularly in the areas of domestic goods, food and sundries and fresh. And as you might expect, our travel business is impacted due to reduced demand, as well as higher-than-normal cancellations of previously booked trips, particularly as it relates to cruises and international travel. I don't think there's any surprise with that. At this point, it's hard to quantify what the financial impact will be for our future results -- to our future results. Again, the first week-and-a-half of this fiscal quarter, it's been -- the last week-and-a-half has been quite good with the sales, but we'll see what tomorrow brings. We'll continue to pass that information along and, of course, we do report monthly sales results. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our March sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, April 5, on Wednesday, April 8, after the market closes. With that, I will open it up to Q&A and turn it back over to Rochelle. Thank you. Yes. Yeah. We weren't that specific, but a lot of it has to do with the fact that, that one -- particularly, that one week, where it's so important to e-commerce on promotional items, for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, the weekend, the three days leading up to Thanksgiving, so you do have some lower-margin -- you have some lower-margin categories in there to start with, as well as, we do a lot more promotional stuff, as most retailers do, with that week of Thanksgiving. And I want to stand corrected, there's a couple of people here just correct me. The e-com numbers are not in the core-on-core. So that would be outside of that. But it's still the strength in majors. It's both. I mean, as we try to build new categories over the last year or so like apparel, we're giving some hot deals out there. If you buy one shirt, it's X if you buy two; it's a little less for delivery or whatever else. So, we're driving that business. And again we've talked about -- yes, but the big thing is electronics. Electronics tends to be a low-margin business not only TVs, but all the computer and phone things. Well I'd argue that we are putting a lot of it back in price. Keep in mind of all the buckets we talked about historically from the membership fee income to the tax reform to the changing credit card, those things keep growing and it allows us to be competitive. And when we see strong sales, I think it encourages us to do more of that. And the other thing is I'm not going to go through 10 different things, but there's lots of things. We're very busy. It's not just the five basis points I mentioned in IT. We got a lot going on with the e-com fulfillment, with the chicken complex which I mentioned, there's a lot -- with the CCPA. These are small things but each of these are various numbers of basis points. CCPA is the privacy -- California Privacy Act. We don't point it out because I'm sure there's something that goes the other way sometimes. But at the end of the day, there's a lot of things going on and we feel pretty good about where our expenses are, in other words, we're going to try to improve them. Its $2 million, is it? $2 million? It's $2 million even with FX. I honestly don't know. I know even a few people -- I mean the shopping frequency is off the charts for the last few days. And you see it on social media with people sending in pictures. So, I've got to believe there's been a little bit of it but not enough to move the needle. I don't have it in front of me. I know that there was -- gas was inflationary, correct? I think -- in Q2, it was 7.9% inflationary. Yes. $2.75 versus $2.55. Well, every banker calls us every day to let us know that rates are even lower today time to borrow. But, no, look we continue to look at it. We talked about it in every Board meeting and all I can tell you is stay tuned. Well, we don't know. People have asked us what happens when people have been bulking up on certain items. And, yes, there's out of stocks every day too. But overall the numbers are incredible because there's so many people coming in. And they're buying other stuff as well. So I don't know what tomorrow brings. When asked the question, are the people then go through this additional purchasing of water and shelf-stable food items and everything, I guess it depends. Are some of them putting it in their basements for another day, some of it related to the fact that people aren't eating out as much. I think it's a combination of those factors. All we know is that last week starting Tuesday or Wednesday, which is when a lot of the news went even -- went -- in the U.S. went even further we had a huge pickup in traffic, which continued over the weekend and increased, and increased the first few days of this even further in the first few days of this month -- this week. And so we'll see what tomorrow brings. And again on the supply side, there is clearly not just -- at Costco and other places you really can't go in and generally find sanitizing items and what have you. And while we're getting shipments daily somewhere in the U.S. whatever limited amounts we get or allocated is gone pretty quickly. And I would assume that over the next few weeks or several weeks that will abate. But it depends what else happens with the virus itself. Yeah. What's interesting, I'm just looking at some hand-written notes from our -- I spoke to our senior buyers yesterday. You would think things like patio furniture would be impacted because it's a big ticket discretionary items. The comment was we're selling it extremely well. Now part of that is we've got a bunch more people coming in, so maybe per customer -- the purchase per customer is down a little but there's a lot more customers. And so -- and -- what else lawn and garden is doing well. The buyers' view is that's more weather related in certain markets. There has been some impact in -- excuse me? No lawn and garden are weather related. And then in some electronics items, while some are strong, there's others like some laptops and some phones where there's been some supply chain issues. But I would say, overall the initial thought -- my initial thought is that, big-ticket discretionary items might be negatively impacted right now. To the extent they are, it's been more than offset at least in these last several days by the influx of shopping frequency. I don't know what that means for tomorrow we'll have to see. Generally there's been no change in MVM items. I mean if it's up a little or down a little I think that's random not planned. And as it relates to shipping at least the people in the room with me here are not aware of that. Was it? Sure. Thank you. It's still relatively new for us over the last year. Overall in -- my knowledge of this is a couple of months old. It's a slight improvement. The concern of course is as they buy more having delivered in one day and two day and then they come in less frequently. But how less frequently and they are coming in a little less regularly but the sum of the two still is fine. Again it's too early to tell in our view just fine continue? Or does it change a little bit. We're still -- but keep in mind also, we continue to do a lot of things consciously even through e-mails to get you come back in the location with certain promotional things that are in-store only. Food sundries overall is -- yes, it's about in line, I would say, on the company averages. Yes. We're just -- I mean, at the end of the day, our heart is we're merchants, and we try to drive business. And fresh is an area that also is a frequency driver. So it's more -- my comment is more anecdotal than some new change in strategy. No that is \u2013 the increased level of competition that I've talked about that goes back a year and a half plus ago. And that hasn't changed. Well, I mean at the end of the day it's a small amount of basis points. When we issue a significant amount \u2013 you can kind of back into the number yourself of what percentage of our sales are the 2% reward. And we send out those certificates and there's always going to be some slippage. Notwithstanding the fact that, we send out reminders to our members that you haven't cashed this. At the end of the day we tend to be \u2013 we do our best guess to accrue for slippage. And I'd like to think that we tend to be a little conservative. And therefore when there's a review it picks up the other way. But at the end of the day we \u2013 accounting rules say, you do your best guess of what it should be. And then when you re-review it you adjust that. Right. Well, it's hard to say because this one is so off the charts. I mean, again the last few weeks \u2013 the last several weeks with some limitations on number of members for some of that period of time, it's changed a little bit. But I mean that was either a top or second largest location in our company for the several weeks leading up to that. And the number of members is again off the charts. Nearly five times the company. No, no, no. Because given the population of Shanghai and the fact that this thing went throughout social media and it was very popular over there. You have a somewhat higher renewal rate, we don't know yet because we opened it in August. But we know from other countries \u2013 I'm sorry, lower \u2013 lower rental rate. And no and you can't just simply multiply that out. But our \u2013 but the unit overall is again either number one or two, up until the last few weeks with what's going on over there with coronavirus was one of our top two units. Yes. Look, we don't disclose that but more executive members and more penetration of executive members is good. More members who have the \u2013 in the case of the United States, the co-brand credit card is good. And if they have both in the executive and that it's even better. All those things I think are \u2013 help our sales growth. It's definitely proactive on our part. And, I think, it's all of the above. It's protein. It's fresh -- I mean its produce. Who knows? Clearly, week four was different than weeks one, two and three, for everything. And just a sheer number of people coming into the warehouse. I personally believe that given that restaurants probably have been impacted a little bit the last couple of weeks. They're buying more at supermarkets and more at Costco, so those things help a little bit as well. Well, yeah, I think, there's a lot of additional things that cost you. I mean, there's not a lot of it, but I'm sure there's a little air freight going on. And I'm sure there's -- when you've got a high-cube, high-weight, low-value items like water, for the hectoliter it's for $2.99 or something, and you're going through it faster than you could put it on the floor. There's more labor and everything else. But it's still a net positive. In the scheme of things, I don't know if it helps or hurts the bottom a little bit. So. Okay. Yes. And the other thing is, they're not just coming and getting those five items and moving. They're shopping a little bit. Again, I personally was surprised that patio furniture is strong. And maybe per person it's a little weaker, but there's a lot more persons. I believe -- I don't have it in front of me, but I believe last year we said gas helped us, relative to the prior year. It was pretty -- it wasn't worth talking about, plus or minus either way. This year versus last. It must be those investments in price. No, at the end of the day it is generally around the world. I think Korea has been a little less of that probably a little less of that benefit. But there's been -- there was an outbreak there that had a lot of publicity and I think there were more people perhaps staying home are not going out. The -- but when I look at U.S., Canada, and several other countries, all of them had big upticks in that last -- the past nine or so days. And I'm sorry what was the last part of the question? There's probably lots of little things I'd like -- my mother would say we're good merchants and great stuff at low prices. There's nothing that stands out completely. And certainly there was not a lot of press out there issues around coronavirus even though was in the news a little bit. So, maybe on a macro basis, there's a little bit of that in there. I think there may have been some weather issues a year ago that may have impacted a little. But overall, we were -- in those three weeks, forgetting about week four, which was off the charts, it was -- we're feeling pretty good about it that some of the stuff we're doing is working from a merchandising standpoint and a pricing standpoint. Well, I think -- first of all, there has been an impact on it. It's now starting to get a little bit further than normal back to normal on regular stuff. On some of the virus-related items that people are buying like water and sanitizing items and paper tiles and things like that, that's going to take a little bit while longer. When I ask the buyers they're working day-to-day with suppliers. You've got suppliers that are literally working around the clock to produce and to ship. But again people are coming in and buying stuff, if you will, for their basement. Well, I think I mentioned there have been -- we have seen some little impact on some laptops and some cell phones and I think that's related to some of the things that we all read about in the paper about some shortage -- some delays because of some of the component parts. I think one thing that helps us a little as we're able to pivot a little bit. So, if there was a shortage or something with one area, we're able to put something else in its place since we sell pretty much everything. But we just don't know what's going to happen tomorrow. First order of business is to get the supply chains back open and running well. There are two kinds of supply chain issues. There's a supply chain issue related to all these very high demand items related to fighting and protecting yourself; the waters, the sanitizing, and things like that. And then there's just stuff, I mean everything from furniture to apparel to electronics coming from China. And on the latter, it seems at least while the one week -- and keep in mind given, the planned Chinese New Year week, there were stuff bought in early not only by us, but I'm sure others and so -- but then there's two more weeks of closures. So, those kind of things over the last three weeks in terms of talking about buyers, the supply chain has -- and the manufacturers are now back open they went from zero if you will the 25% to 40% to 50% to 60%, 80% and now it's getting to the ports. And some of those things are also being abated, some of the issues there. So my guess is if everything got better tomorrow from a concern standpoint, you still have a few weeks here where it takes time to fill those supply chains. Well, I think we -- this is -- that's what we do. I mean, I think we've done a great job. We've been helped by strong big-ticket categories like electronics, like patio furniture and lawn and garden right now and other hardlines and softlines areas. Fresh continues to drive our business. We -- as you know when we're asked what are the two or three big factors that drive our business -- or of categories. It's fresh, it's gas, it's executive membership. And again utilizing those different bucket -- even when sales are good, we want to be aggressive in pricing. And when sales are bad, we want to be aggressive more aggressive in pricing. When the sales are good, we want to be more aggressive in pricing. It drives -- the top line improvements drive the bottom line. Well, I think it was mid-September when we -- when the first chicken went through the plan if you will. The plan was that 45 weeks later there would be approximately 2.2 million birds a week being processed. And so call it September to August. And so we're a little bit past the halfway mark on that. And I believe in terms of production, we're a little bit past the halfway mark on that. Call it one million birds a week. It should be off a little bit on either side. And so a lot of this has to do with the fact that you've got this big facility that is running at well below capacity. The amount of impairment to margin related to that in Q2 was less than Q1. We would expect it to be less than in Q3 and further. So once we get the full capacity I think -- and then I'm sure there's going to be some operational improvements over the first couple of years as well. At the end of the day, it's a combination of sourcing just simpler supply. And our view is, is we can improve if you will the ultimate cost per bird. But we don't know that yet. We spent a little more than we planned, but we also upgraded the facility to be air chilled instead of water chilled. It truly is a state-of-the-art facility for the U.S. and a very high volume facility. And I would say, right now, things are going as planned in terms of that 45-week cycle. And I would like to think that a year from now -- six months from now or two more quarters from now, it's not going to be an issue that we really even talk about as it relates to how it impacted margin. A little bit. I don't think it'll be that wrong. No. I mean we saw an increase but not really. I mean mind you that -- we saw -- yes throughout February we saw some increase in e-commerce. But again if people are looking for those -- the sense of urgency I'm going out right now and get it in things like water and everything. And some of those key items like peanut butter and crackers and the like, we have online as well. And those too in some regions there might be in and out of stocks. Well I think the only insight is -- from what I've read it is not -- is the issue that more people are staying at home and not even going out. Whereas even near the -- I love the publicity that the state of Washington and King County is getting with a few of the -- there are people out and about. There's a little less traffic on the highways. And -- but notwithstanding that that's some highways coming to see us. Well first of all, it's gotten more press than it deserves. There are I believe seven current locations on the West Coast where we -- and I believe they are all outdoor locations. And one of the challenges that we've had is, particularly on very busy locations where people that are non members just come and eat there every day. You've got member complaints saying, why are you -- I have to pay the come to Costco. And so we took -- we're testing it in seven locations that we are limiting it to members only. It's easy in locations where you have the food court inside. But on -- and many of the ones in areas where the weather is generally good like California, Arizona and things like that you have a lot of them are outside. And so we'll see. But that's -- but again, seven locations out of 540, we're testing it at and it's gotten a lot of press. This is just a quote from the FDA yesterday and said well the FDA and other outlets are reporting disruptions and medical products are possible. At this time manufacturers are reporting that no specific drugs are experienced in shortage due to the impact of COVID-19. And talking to our Head of Pharmacy yesterday, he said the only thing that we've seen there's been a little pickup there as well. Let's say somebody has a year-long prescription. So four nine -- a prescription plus 990-day refills for -- and they'll come in and they'll want all four of them filled now. And in some cases even when their particular insurance plan doesn't cover it, they're paying cash. They're just hoarding -- they're hoarding up on their prescription to make sure we're not running out. But that's more again, I think the same thing you're seeing with paper goods. But from a supply and availability standpoint, but we haven't seen anything yet. Why don't we take two more questions. As it relates to costs, the general view of the buyers is, is that we have \u2013 I get back to the comment I made earlier about strong relations. To the extent that there's some raw materials cost increases because of shortages, that's going to rain on everybody. In our view, it rains on us a little less. But I think we \u2013 given the limited number of items we buy and the amount of things we \u2013 the amount of any given item that we buy, our buyers, we feel, know a lot more about the cost structure. And so I haven't seen any commentary on that internally other than there was one small comment I can't find it in my mess of papers here, that there may be \u2013 in some small cases, some raw material increases on some particular item \u2013 some particular raw material for some manufacturing process. But overall, there's not been a big issue. Right now, the only increase in transportation has some very limited items where there's been a little bit of airfreight, what we're finding is, is that the ports are getting back to capacity and there's plenty of space. And so that's not been as big an issue. As it relates to an e-comm investment. There's not a lot I have my plate to tell you today, we're working on more things related to our app, to our membership digital app. And we certainly have some things going on on the fulfillment side of e-commerce. And we've been focused on getting two more countries opened, as I mentioned in the last quarter. And we think \u2013 there are a few other things that we've got going on that I'll be happy to chat with the next time around. Well, customers like it, but we don't like it necessarily. We're doing buy online and pick up in-store for some small items \u2013 small high-value items. But we're not at the point where we're looking for members to buy online they come up and pick up their whole grocery baskets. So we're trying to figure out our way. And certainly \u2013 again, the last nine or so days notwithstanding, seems \u2013 things seem to be working pretty well for us in that regard. We continue to work on the \u2013 where we've had good sales and good strength over the last few years in e-commerce is taking certain big and bulky things out of the warehouse, white goods and things that are delivered, in some cases, installed, and so we continue to work on those kind of things as well. How do we measure it? Well, again, the last week-and-a-half notwithstanding, because it's been nuts. No, first of all, member comments and basic member renewal rates. I mean, we actually -- the operators and all the way up to Craig, see weekly information on comments. You can't imagine how many people call and e-mail when to have something that they're concerned about. And we also measure the least expected, but the positive letters to that effect. On the operations side, the key is still -- well, aside from merchandising, the art of merchandising out there and giving the warehouse managers the assistant managers and the merchandisers -- whereas merchandisers some leeway, not -- I mean, certainly electronics is when you walk in and there's defensive promotional goods and fresh is in the back. But the end of the day, there is a bit of merchandising that is pushed down to the regional and warehouse level. And that's what, I think, drives our business there. In terms of the front end, managing the front end, I think, we've got less count, 120 of our 540-ish locations in the U.S. with self-checkout. And we plan another 100 in the next three months. And so, always trying to figure out and measuring the number of transact -- number of member transactions through the front end per hour. Yes. No. Well, I think, it's all over the board. Yesterday, I think, there was a couple of -- either Los Angeles or San Diego counties that announced a heightened level of concern. King County here in Seattle did that a couple of days ago. When that happens, that's another catalyst to puts people to go out and get more stuff. I would hope -- and, look, we would all hope this thing peaks and starts to slow down. It depends what happens tomorrow. We'll be tired, but still working hard. Given that half of our employees -- roughly -- a little over half of our -- of the 90% of employees in our warehouses that are hourly, about a little over half of those 90% are full-time and a little under half of are part-time. Certainly, there are employees that want to work more than part-time and so we've been able to accommodate some additional hours there. But everybody is a little tired but that's what you do. Well, the only thing I mentioned there was that in -- and getting ready for today's call, I had spoken to several of the senior merchants in the different categories. And one thing without even looking at the numbers I thought is I assume some of the big ticket discretionary items might be a little weaker because people are not running in to get those items. They're running in to get other concerned items. And the fact was to my surprise that they said that certain items like patio furniture and lawn and garden was strong. They felt -- and again it was just their view that patio -- lawn and garden was more related to some of the areas of the country where the weather has turned already. And -- but clearly because you got X percent more people coming in every day than normal. Okay. Well thank you everyone. Have a good afternoon and we're around to answer any questions. Have a good day."

After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO. Please go ahead, sir.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you Laurie and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the 12 weeks ended November 24. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $844 million or $1.90 per share compared to $767 million or $1.73 a share last year in the first quarter. This year's first quarter results included a $77 million or $0.17 per share income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Last year's first quarter results included a $59 million or $0.13 per share income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Net sales for the quarter came in at $36.24 billion, a 5.6% increase over the $34.31 billion sold during the first quarter of last year. Comparable sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 in the U.S. on a reported basis was 4.7%, ex-gas deflation was 5.0%. Canada reported a 2.9%, ex-gas deflation and FX plus 5.1%. Other international reported 3.2%, ex-gas deflation and FX plus 4.5%. So total company was a 4.3% reported and ex gas deflation and FX of 5.0% E-commerce on a reported basis was a 5.5% and a 5.7% on a reported basis. Total and comparable company sales for the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately 0.5% due to Thanksgiving occurring a week later this year. E-commerce sales in the quarter were negatively impacted by an estimated 12 percentage points. So again the 5.5% and 5.7% were impacted to the negative by 12 percentage points. In terms of the Q1 comp sales metrics, first quarter traffic or shopping frequency increased 3.4% worldwide and 3.1% in the U.S. This again includes the impact of the Thanksgiving holiday shift. Weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 30 basis points and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 40 basis points. Our average transaction or ticket was up 0.9% during the quarter including the negative impacts of gas deflation, FX, and the holiday shift. Next on the income statement, membership fee income. Reported membership fee income came in at $804 million, up 6.1% or $46 million from last year's $758 million. Deflation, foreign of FX currencies would have impacted that by a $1 million to the negative. So, it would have been about $1 million higher, ex FX. In terms of renewal rates at Q1-end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rates came in at 90.9% and worldwide rate was 88.4%, both of these figures remaining at the same renewal rate levels that were achieved 12 weeks ago at the fiscal year-end. In terms of number of members at Q1-end, in terms of member households and total cardholders, at Q4-end back in, I think on September 1, we had 53.9 million member households at Q1 and 12 weeks later was 54.7 million, and total cardholders increased from fiscal year end of 98.5 million to 99.9 million at Q1 end. During the quarter, we had three new openings, all in the U.S., a business center in Dallas, Texas; and two additional Costco warehouses in Connecticut and Minnesota. We also relocated one of our units in Canada. At Q1-end, paid executive memberships totaled 21.4 million, an increase of $579,000 or 48,000 per week since Q4-end. This included the recent launch of offering executive memberships to [indiscernible] the first time as of the beginning of the fiscal year. Even taking those out, the average weekly increase would have been ex the new [indiscernible], executive members would been 41,000 a week. Going down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was higher year-over-year by 30 basis points coming in at 11.05% as compared to a year ago 10.75%, and again on a reported basis 30 ex-gas deflation would have been plus 26. Doing the little chart that we do each quarter, two columns reported ex-gas deflation. First line item would be core merchandise year-over-year in Q1 of 2020 compared to a year earlier quarter, minus 3 basis points on a reported basis and minus 6 basis points on an ex-gas deflation basis. Ancillary businesses plus 20 and plus 19. No change to the 2% reward, and other was plus 13 and plus 13. So total of plus 30 basis points on a reported basis and plus 26 ex-deflation. Now, the core merchandise component of gross margin, again lower by 3 year-over-year reported minus 6 ex-gas deflation. Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation to their own sales, core on core, if you will. Margins year-over-year were higher by 4 basis points. Subcategories within the core margins year-over-year in Q1 showed increases in hardlines, softlines, and food and sundries and a decrease in fresh foods. Nearly all of that decrease in fresh foods was the result of the initial operating losses from our new poultry complex. That will be a small headwind throughout the year. Recall that we commenced operations at the Nebraska chicken plant on September 10 with roughly a 45-week plan to get to full production and processing capacity, and we are currently on track to do so. Ancillary and other business gross margin, higher by 20 reported and 19 ex-gas deflation. The highlights in the year-over-year being gas, optical, tire shop, and hearing aids. The other, the pus 13 compared to year ago, this relates to what we mentioned last year in the quarter to adjusting our estimate of breakage on rewards for the Citi Visa cobranded card program last year, and that was again in comparison of the hit last year versus zero this year. Moving to SG&A. Our reported SGA percentage in Q1-over-Q1 year-over-year was higher by 17 basis points coming in at 10.30%, up from 10.13% last year. Ex-gas deflation SG&A was higher or worse by 13 basis points. Again, the little matrix that we do, both reported and without gas deflation, operations minus 9 basis points, meaning higher by 9 basis points versus minus 5 basis points ex deflation. Central, minus 4 and minus 4. Stock compensation, minus 4 and minus 4. For a total, again, of minus 17 and minus 13. These figures include, in terms of the core being minus 5 on an ex-gas deflation basis, this figure includes the impact from the wage increases that we talked about in the last couple of quarters that occurred. This impact relates to wage increases that occurred in March 2019, which hit the year-over-year comparison by 3 basis points to 4 basis points in the quarter. As mentioned previously, we would expect a similar impact that will occur in Q2 before we anniversary that wage increase midway through Q3. Central was higher again by four basis points year-over-year. IT was the biggest driver of the increase as we continued not only to maintain and upgrade but expand our capabilities and activities and certainly we have a lot going on there. And stock comp again minus four basis points hit there. That hit usually is in Q1 year-over-year based on the fact that we grant RSUs in that quarter and how we do things for employees 25, 30 and 35 years out. On the income statement. Next one is the pre-opening expense. It's lower by $8 million. It came in at $14 million this year in the first quarter versus $22 million. This year in the quarter, we had four total openings, three plus the relocation. Last year, we had eight total openings, six plus two relocations. All told, operating income in Q1 increased by 11.8%, coming in at $1.61 billion this year compared to $949 million last year. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $2 million higher year-over-year, $38 million this year in Q1 compared to $36 million last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher or better by $13 million. Interest income was actually higher by $11 million and others plus $2 million variance was primarily favorable FX year-over-year. Overall pre-tax income in the first quarter of 2020 was up 13%, coming in at $1.58 billion compared to last year's $935 million. In terms of income taxes, our reported tax rate in Q1 2020 was 19.1% compared to 16.9% in Q1 of last year. Both of these first quarter tax rates, this year and last year, benefited from the tax treatment of stock-based compensation, as mentioned earlier. Last year's rate also benefited from an additional discrete item, which we mentioned in the quarter last year. A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, we expect to open net new units of somewhere around 20, plus or minus, with a lot of it planned to open new openings, much of it back-loaded towards the end of the fiscal year. As of Q1-end, we had total warehouse square footage of 114 million square feet. Regarding capital expenditures. In Q1, our total spend was approximately $700 million and our estimate of CapEx for all of fiscal 2020 remains right around the $3 billion amount. In terms of e-commerce, our overall e-commerce sales on a reported basis in the quarter was a 5.5%, as I mentioned earlier and again ex-FX 5.7%. Again, those numbers, you could add roughly 12 percentage points to each of those to account for our estimate of the impact of the holiday shift. A few of the stronger departments, home furnishings, domestics, tires and pharmacy. Majors, electronics were not among those departments as we believe it was the one most impacted by the holiday shift. Total online grocery continues to grow at a faster rate than the core e-commerce comps, although again it's a still relatively small piece of the business. New online during the quarter expanded tickets offerings including airline gift cards, Lyft and Uber cards and Super Bowl packages. We also, during the quarter, launched as a test in a few locations same day prescription Rx delivery with Instacart and we launched in the quarter same-day alcohol delivery also through Instacart in California such that as of today, it's being offered in 12 states. And lastly, earlier this week, we launched our Japan e-commerce site with our Australia site planned to open in the first half of calendar 2020. In terms of tariffs, there continues to be a lot of moving parts and changes up to and including an hour ago. Currently, there are again 3.5 lists, if you will. Lists 1, 2, 3 and 4 A, totaling about $360 billion worth of imports. There were possibilities that there would be a 4B list would go into place December 15. Although the current news out today is that China and the U.S. are close to a deal and on finalizing a Phase 1 part of the trade deal. And so we will have to wait and see. In terms of the EU. Currently, again there's $7.5 billion of U.S. imports that are subject to a current 20% tariff, mostly food items like olive oil, cheese, wine, whiskey, butter cookies, et cetera. Again, last week, just last Monday, the White House announced that it proposed increase to 100% tariff on $24 billion in imports, which would include those in among other items. We will just have to wait and see where that is. I believe comments aren't even anticipated to be complete until early to mid-January. That's pretty much it on our part. Lastly, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our December sales results for the five-weeks ending Sunday, January 5 on Wednesday, January 8 after market close. And with that, I will open it up to Q&A and turn it back to Laurie. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. Please ask your question.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good evening. So, I just want to step back and get your thoughts in terms of how you plan the holiday season this year given that there are six fewer days. It seems like a lot of retailers are expecting a big surge at the end, bigger than normal into Christmas, given the shortened season. Is that something, I am not asking about December just how you planned it? Is it something you saw in 2013? Is it something you are planning for in 2019 and maybe any comment through what you have reported so far?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think we planned it and with some historical knowledge of what's happened in the past when you have got the shortest period of time between Thanksgiving and Christmas. And we plan, assuming that we are going to continue to have the types of levels of comps that we have in general, recognizing sometimes there's a switch between months as example being the switching -- Thanksgiving being in November versus -- Q1 rather versus Q2 for us in our example. But so yes, we do expect to ramp up on a per day basis. We will have to wait and see where it goes. But we went into the planning, I think, with the confidence that we have had, good shopping frequency increases and good renewal rates and pretty good comps.\nChristopher Horvers: Understood. And then on the pricing environment, it seems like Sam's has been taking some bigger hits to the gross margin line and it seems to be benefiting comps. So, are you seeing a step-up in terms of, in that core club channel? Are you seeing a step-up in price investment from your peers?\nRichard Galanti: In a word, no.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. That's fair enough. And then my last question is, in 2Q you are going to lap, I think, a pretty big benefit in the ancillary line last year. I think it was up 33 basis points, big part of that being gas, so you are going to have gas prices. Do we have to give that all back? I mean gas prices look like they will be up year-over-year at this point but are still going to be down a bit sequentially and I know there is an interplay between those two dynamics. So, any thoughts you could give us around lapping that 33 basis points given those dynamics would be super helpful?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think profitably for gas for us and as we have read from other retailers, big retailers that have gas stations as part of their retail concept, it's the new normal over the last few years. It has been a more profitable business. We, I think, benefit from the fact that we have seen our gallon increases on a comp basis in the very high single digits. So, we know we are taking market share. Despite increased profitability in that business, our savings in our view, when we can do price shops of competitors gas, it has never been as strong. So, we feel very good about where we are with that. Now sequentially, part of the increase, when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, last year's plus 30 or whatever, I don't have it in front of me, but whatever it was, had as much to do as what it was the year before. I think again when you read what others have said and what we have said in the last couple of quarters, it's been pretty good for all of us. So, it may be, you are not going to see that kind of delta on top of the big delta last year nor are you are going to see the big negative from that, negative from it coming back two years ago, but we will have to wait and see. We think what we have learned about gas profitability is, it could be very fleeting. Right now, it's been good as it was last quarter and as it was over the last couple of years in general, but you never know how to predict it from sometimes week to week.\nChristopher Horvers: Awesome, guys. Have a great holiday. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is now open.\nMichael Lasser: Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Richard, you touched on this briefly. But how have tariffs impacted Costco's profitability and if some of the tariffs are rolled back, how is Costco is going to handle this? Should we be modeling margin benefit over the next couple of quarters from this dynamic?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think generally we have said on a qualitative basis, that overall I think companies of scale and certainly we are one of those and the fact that we feel that we have had a relatively good mitigation plan, if you will, easier on a 10% tariff than a 25%. I think one thing again on top of this, our scale in general, our ability to move in and out of items, if all of your items are 25% tariff because you are a furniture retailer or whatever retailer, that's different than a company that has a small percentage of our business in that area. Like others, we have moved a few things where we can and sourced it out of other countries. I think our total China imports into the U.S. is about just a few percentage points lower than a year ago. So, nobody can do a lot of that nor can we. But generally speaking, I don't think it's -- it's hard enough for us to budget it into our numbers. What we look at is, is the fact that in some cases where the price has gone up and we have passed on all or some of it, we haven't seen an impact to the unit sales. On others, we have and we never know until it happens, which ones are more elastic than others, if you will. But at the end of the day, we think that we have done as good as anybody in terms of being able to mitigate the impact. And so again, I think the fact that our margins, our core on core margins, generally speaking, even in the departments like hardlines and softlines, have been slightly up year-over-year. And certainly, we haven't done that without first and foremost being the most competitive out there. That makes us feel that now, we don't want it to continue and we don't want List 4B to come on or anything else to go higher. But I think we have done okay by it.\nMichael Lasser: So in cases where you have taken price or reengineered a product to make it cheaper, how do you handle that?\nRichard Galanti: Well, first of all, I don't think ever we have tried to reengineer a product. We are going to try to figure out how to get the price down a little bit with the help of our suppliers. Sometimes, our own money or whatever else we can or moving a few items to another country and sometimes eliminating an item and putting something else in its place here. So I remember I think one anecdotal story would be in late calendar 2008 when the economic downturn hit hard and what hit hard in our case was a as good as our values were on $1,000 and $1,500 patio furniture, we had a lot of markdowns to take care to get through that in January, February and March when that stuff hit the floors. I can remember vividly, come June, following that when we were still in a bad economic downturn and our head of merchandising and our CEO reminding everybody, it's a budget meeting, I don't want to see us bring down the quality and stuff to hit a price point. We have taken 20, 30 years to get our members comfortable with the types of values we can bring, particularly on bettering goods. And so might we buy a few less units of something? Yes. Might we augment a little bit with some offerings? Yes. But we try not to.\nMichael Lasser: That's helpful. And my follow-up question is, given the well-publicized website outage over the holiday weekend, should we read that as Costco needs to make a more meaningful investment in its technology infrastructure to keep up with the growing size of that business?\nRichard Galanti: Well, first of all, we live it every day here and certainly and we are. It was unfortunate. Despite all the efforts to have plenty of processing capacity, if you will, there was something that incurred. When we look at the five days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, those five days on a year-over-year basis, I mean we still were up in the very high teens as a percentage on e-commerce, so consistent what we have showed you what we have currently been running. What it tells us, we could have done better than that. So we did leave something on the table there. And again, we were able to correct it. It took several hours that day, unfortunately. But rest assured, we are spending a lot of money on things like that.\nMichael Lasser: Understood. Have a great holiday.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Please ask your question.\nChuck Grom: Hi. Good afternoon, Richard. First question on MFI. Now we are past the fee increase and FX is normalizing, I am just wondering if you see any material reason why the 6% growth you reported in the quarter wouldn't be a good proxy in the coming quarters?\nRichard Galanti: Well, who knows as certainly, one of the reasons why it's growing a little faster than the total sales line, a little of it's a couple of recent openings like the China opening. That's a little of it. I think more importantly, it's some of the things that we have done a much better job of getting new members to sign up as an executive remember. You saw in terms of the number of new member which is a combination of new membership signing up as executive member as well as conversions to these executive member, we are doing a better job of that as well. And of course that aside from improving membership fees, they are more loyal member that shop more frequently and renew more at a slightly higher rate. And so I think a lot of it is some of the things that we are doing, getting the growing number of members, I mean U.S. as a example here with the Citi Visa card, signing up for that and having auto-renewal as well as opting into auto-renewal on other Visa cards that somebody may choose to use at Costco. And so those are the things that help as well. I would like to think it's all related to just great value and that's more things that we offer the member, which is certainly part of it too.\nChuck Grom: Okay. Understood. And just to switch over to the balance sheet a little bit. Inventory levels were a little bit heavier. I presume that's just the timing of Thanksgiving. Any way to normalize for that, maybe inventory per club or some other metric, just to get a sense for what sort of apples-to-apples would look like?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Well, I think it's mostly the shift of holiday. Some of it is a buildup with e-commerce and those holidays as well with more in the system. We are doing more fulfillment on that side. Again, in the few days since then, it's come down as we have expected. So I don't think there is a whole lot to read into it.\nChuck Grom: Okay. Great. And then just last one on the core on core up 4%. Maybe quantify for us the drag that you are going to continue to see and then what you saw here in the current quarter from the chicken plant, just to get a sense for how much that was to the quarter?\nRichard Galanti: Well, the thing about, if we open the chicken plant, the first chicken, if you will, went through on September 10. Hopefully 45 weeks later, there will be roughly 2.2 million chickens a week going through there. The first three months, if you will, which is Q1 here, September, October and part of most of November, you were at the lowest end of that. I don't want to straight line it completely, but it's close enough for this discussion, going from one chicken to 2.2 million chickens, if you will. There is a lot of operating cost in running the plant. And while we don't have both production lines running yet, there's just a lot of cost associated with that. It should be a diminishing drag in Q2 and then Q3 and then Q4 and then not be an issue.\nChuck Grom: Makes sense. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And we have Chris Mandeville from Jefferies. Please ask your question. Your line is now open.\nChris Mandeville: Hi Richard. So just a quick question on Central SG&A, similar to Michael. I am just curious with respect to the IT investment, if we should be assuming that that pressure that was realized in the quarter actually progressively gets a little bit more prominent on a go-forward basis? I don't know if that's what you were trying to reference or allude to with respect to expanding your capabilities and activities? Or if we should be thinking about something similar on a go-forward basis?\nRichard Galanti: If I look over the last several years with that word we have stopped using completely called modernization and now it's some modernization but other things as well. We talked about in the last, I talked about in the last several quarters things like e-comm fulfillment spending a lot of money on that. A lot of that hits SG&A in terms of all that technology. The chicken plant, to some extent. We have also over the last couple of years done a reset of certain departments within IT based on wage competition in this part of the woods up here in the Northwest. So I mean there's a lot of things that go into it. And we have got a lot going on, whether it's e-comm, continued increases in infrastructure and vertical integration as well as our depot operations and modernization. So I don't know. I think that when we first started talking about modernization years ago and it was just that, as best we could we estimated originally over a few years it would be incremental 10 basis points to the company. And then quickly, we felt it could be 13 and ultimately it was 18 or 19. And then, a couple of years went on a quarter-over-quarter basis, some quarters it was six and some quarters, it was two or zero. So I think a couple of quarters ago, maybe three quarters ago, it was flat year-over-year to that impact. And I reminded people that don't read anything into that like it is an inflection point. We have a lot going on both related to modernization stuff as well as expanding as well as vertical integration. So my guess is, it will still be a negative year-over-year. There's a negative, when those negatives anniversary a year hence, will we have incremental negative net? I can't say. At some point, it's supposed to slow down.\nChris Mandeville: Okay. And then just my follow-up would be with respect to the Instacart pilot and delivering Rx to your members. I guess just what exactly you are attempting to accomplish there? And is the structure of delivering pharmacy any different in terms of how you are approaching things from a grocery perspective?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Well, no, look, it's convenience. Like anything in life out there, as you might expect, we are always asked when are you going to start to do order it online and pickup up in store, when are you going to do this, when you are going to have something else. And we kind of do things our own way. We look at all these things and this is one area that with the Instacart relationship where we have them already coming into our locations, let's give this a shot. We already have a good and growing mail-order business. We have 540-ish pharmacies around the country. But this is another opportunity. Our pharmacies are sometimes, somebody does, won't come out if they are not feeling well. And so it was an opportunity given and as density increases that should help. But you have already got these drivers delivering groceries to others, hopefully we can do this. And it is something to add to the competitive belt here.\nChris Mandeville: Is there a notable impact to one's kind of Rx margin profile? I guess I am just curious about that the economics there?\nRichard Galanti: No. First of all, it's brand new. And it's just a few locations, going to roll out to a few more shortly. So we will see where it goes.\nChris Mandeville: All right. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question.\nMichael Kessler: Hi there. This is Michael Kessler, on for Simeon. So a question on the competitive environment. We have seen Sam's Club undergoing an unexpected round of investments recently. And I guess is there anything notable that you would feel the need to respond to as far as what they are doing? Or anything that changes on your end from some of their investments?\nRichard Galanti: Not really. I mean, look, our warehouse managers are in their locations every week. We hear about it and I hear about here every month by location or by region rather. And look, they are a good operator and a good competitor and we feel that we do a lot of things very well too. But there is nothing that I could point out. A year or so ago, we had pointed out that they have gotten a little more aggressive on fresh and some of these things ebb and flow. But at the end of the day, we feel very good about our competitive position.\nMichael Kessler: Got it. Okay. Great. And just one follow-up on China. The new store that you opened there, a little further away from the opening. Is there anything notable that you have learned over the last couple of months? And any changes to your plans as far as the rollout, which I know is a little more on the slower side? But any updates on that front?\nRichard Galanti: Well, first of all, on the rollout side that we have one other one planned which was planned previously. That's probably about a year-and-a-half away. And we will continue to look to see what we want to do next. But not a lot of change there. Overall, the location has exceeded our expectations. We have brought in additional help from neighboring places to help but the sales continue to grow, the sign ups continue to do very well there. And we will see. So we have had a great reception. We feel good about from a merchandising standpoint and maintaining a supply chain. Very good. And we are getting, I think, good reviews over there. We have also identified a few items, one in particular is again just anecdotal. we have done a very good job over there with sea cucumbers which I still have never tried. But we have found is that particularly on the West Coast in several cities where you have got customers that value that as a great item. We have done very well with it. So just like anything in life, we have found items that makes sense in other parts of our operation throughout the world. It's fun to see out there and it's a high value, high price item at a great value at Costco.\nMichael Kessler: All right. Very interesting. Thank you.\nOperator: And we have a question from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Citi. Your line is now open.\nSpencer Hanus: Hi. This is actually Spencer Hanus, on for Greg. You guys called out some sales headwinds related to the website issue. Do you think those sales have been lost? Or do you think they were just pushed out?\nRichard Galanti: I think some was pushed out, some went the warehouse and some was lost. In the scope of things, given our whole company, recognizing that e-commerce while growing faster than the rest of in-line, is still little over 5% of our company. So I don't want to be cavalier about it. We didn't excite the members that were delayed. But we feel we have got, so we extended the values that hit the 30-plus million emails that we sent out it in the early hours of Thursday. We extended those deals for an extra two days. And so we think we got some of it back. And again for that five day period, we did just fine. Frankly, we feel we did lose something that we could have done better than we had anticipated.\nSpencer Hanus: And then any comment on big ticket sales trends that you are seeing? And then how does the consumer feel heading into the holiday season this year?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Big ticket items are strong, particularly electronics items. The fact that back in March or April this past year, we were able now to offer a full line of Apple products including the Macs and the watches and the like. And we have done very well with those. And online, we have done even better with those. And it's not just the Apple products. It's other big ticket high-end game computers and game consoles. Big screen TVs are huge, recognizing the price and value of those things for consumers keep coming down, which is great. Those are the things that have done very well for us.\nSpencer Hanus: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Please ask your question.\nKaren Short: Hi. Thanks very much. Just a couple of questions. I guess starting with the core on core. So you have obviously had pretty meaningful stability, I guess, on the core on core and you alluded to this a couple of quarters ago in terms of your scale and your buying power. But I am wondering if you could just frame a little bit on how we should think about core on core going forward because it does seem like we are kind of in a new norm of that being stable to up generally?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think the fact is that, you are right, all the things that we do to drive value or to get better pricing or based on our volume or Kirkland Signature or whatever, just when you think it's safe to go out, we are going to use it to drive business, which we have done. We talked in the past about the monies from increasing the membership fee, the monies from the change in credit cards, the income tax reform, recognizing about a little over a third of the income tax reform went to improve hourly wages. But at the end of the day, those have given us additional monies to continue to drive value. And there are times when we see something, a particular department or something, where the margin might be very strong year-over-year. That's the first thing we look at. Even if we are giving a greater savings to the customer, is it too much? And so again, we are a for-profit business. We want to grow our topline first and that will help the other things. But we don't manage it completely to the basis point. That we would like to see it year-over-year even go up a little bit, but we have avenues to do that.\nKaren Short: Okay. And then on tariffs, just specifically to the tariffs for this Sunday if they were or not to go into effect. So can you just clarify, I mean the rest of the lists, like 1 through AA, I guess, obviously it's kind of already embedded. But is there anything to think about it in terms of 4B does not go into effect with respect to your positioning or the model or anything?\nRichard Galanti: Anyway, we don't know. I mean to the extent that we bought in advance certain merchandise to the extent we could, anticipating that that was going to go into place and so let's get it in before the tariff, we did. But it wouldn't change it, so as you are saying, it wouldn't change things immediately there. So if I mean, if anything, we have had a little extra inventory in advance of it.\nKaren Short: Okay. And then last few from me is just housekeeping on inflation and food and also in non-food and then thoughts on cash on the balance sheet as it continues to build? Thanks.\nRichard Galanti: Inflation is almost a non-issue. It's not either inflation or deflation, generally speaking. I mean, yes, we mentioned they are slightly deflationary year-over-year. Tariffs is slightly inflationary of course on those limited items. Yes, proteins are up a little. My understanding, that has to do partly with China and with swine flu as well as more demand for beef. Other than that, not a lot to talk about there. What was the other part of the question?\nKaren Short: It's cash on the balance sheet building?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Well, we have two debt repayments coming due this week or next Monday. Next week and in mid-February totaling $1.7 billion from prior debt offerings. Beyond that, of course, cash at the end of Q1 generally is the highest level because you have started to sell more, but you haven't paid for everything yet relative to seasonal stuff or Thanksgiving and Christmas. So like our AP ratio was always the strongest on a quarterly basis. Beyond that, stay tuned.\nKaren Short: Okay. Great. Thanks. Have a great holiday.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you.\nOperator: And we have a question from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.\nJohn Heinbockel: So, Richard, where do you stand now with self-checkout? I know you have been expanding that. How many clubs is that in? What are your learnings, right, in terms of consumer, member satisfaction, speed of checkout? And then what do you think the rate of expansion of that is going to be?\nRichard Galanti: Well, we currently have it in the U.S. and Canada in about 135 locations. It's going well. We have another 92 planned for early calendar 2020. So up above in the low 200s. And the senior operators continue to discuss it, additional rollouts with Craig, based on their performance. But overall, it's a positive. And so we will continue to do it, is my expectation.\nJohn Heinbockel: I mean, roughly speaking, when you think about savings, right. I don't know how material that is but is there an idea that you reinvest that? Can it be enough to reinvest back into the business in something like expanded BOPUS? Or I know you have been sort of reticent about BOPUS because of the cost. Is that something you can now begin to get your arms around? Or no?\nRichard Galanti: Well, first of all, I think thoughts on either of those are mutually exclusive of one another. When I look at the millions or billions of front-end seconds we save in labor, we know full well that some of it is, you don't get it all back, but even if you take a conservative amount, there is money to be saved there. More importantly, the members like it. The only thing the member doesn't like is when there is a member in front of them that is going through with their full basket and is taking longer. But generally speaking, even the high volume, the few high volume units that I have actually gone to of late, like the ones in Seattle and I use them when I am in and now they are fast, they work well and fast. So there is savings. But I think as well it improves that customer experience. As it relates to buy online and pickup in store, we continue to look at what others do and continue to scratch our head and recognizing the average Costco, even compared to our two direct competitors, is two and almost three times the volume per location, almost two times and almost three times the volume per location. So we will have to wait and see. We are still not at a point. We look at it, but we are not at a point that we are planning to do anything with that.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nKate McShane: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. We wanted to ask about apparel. I know that this is a category where you have been a little bit more focused. I wondered if you could give some color about the performance of apparel during the quarter? What you see the opportunity to be? And how Costco can kind of position itself to capture some share going into the next year?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. I think it's part of the same story that we have talked about fortunately for the last few years. Apparel is a combination of both expanded Kirkland Signature as well as a few additional brands willing to sell us or expanding what they are selling us as well and great value. And it's a category in the several billions of dollars that continues to grow in roughly high single digits compared to retail apparel overall that's lot less than that. And I think I am always amazed at our monthly budget meetings when, in this case, buyers are bringing in and showing what's coming in for the new season whether it's outerwear, a few months ago outerwear for the fall or both men's, women's and children's stuff.\nKate McShane: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good evening guys. Richard, I had a follow-up question on the Shanghai location. Can you just provide a context on the sign-up activity of that location relative to a more traditional facility?\nRichard Galanti: It's beyond good. I am sitting here with my colleagues on what I am allowed to say. The average Costco in the world has somewhere in the mid to high 60,000 of member households. We have had locations in other countries in Asia where we might be at a 100,000 to 120,000 after a few years, maybe even after one or two years. This one is more than twice that. So there's lot of press in a city that is populated with 25-plus million people.\nScot Ciccarelli: Yes. I understand. So just given the fact that in the past you kind of talked about how long it takes locations to hit a breakeven point. I guess given the early sales and membership trajectory of that location, does that help change how you are kind of thinking about the breakeven point for that warehouse and hence the China opportunity? Or do you need more distribution scale to really get the profitability to where you want it?\nRichard Galanti: Well getting to seven or eight or 10 locations in a country where a bunch of stuff is American supplied and barge shipped, not air flown, you become more efficient as you go from one to three, maybe using some third-party consolidation or storage to do high value bulk items because you don't want to run out of water or toilet paper as you may, the no-brainer items. And over time, by the time we get up to eight or 10, we want to have a bigger cross-dock with enough land to continue to expand it over time. Cross-docks in the U.S. and Canada serve 40 to 60 locations each and 40 to 60 relatively high volume locations. So we have one in Australia that serves 11 locations. That will continue to be a little bit as an economic improvement to that country as it serves 15 and 20 locations. We have opened two in Japan, essentially south to north for all of 26 or 27 locations. We plan to have a lot more there over time. So certainly, in addition, we have a lot of extra help there. We are doing big volume and we brought over additional people from Taiwan that speaks the local language and then understand our concept and we have been fortunate to have that additional history and expertise when we have gone there, but also with Costco more. So I think you have got, what is the normal once it's doing whatever volume it's doing and it's efficiently run at the warehouse, maybe you don't have all the efficiencies from cross-dock. That will take several years. But the most efficiencies are what's in the building and how many people you need to help that process and become more efficient. So I mean it takes a couple of years to do that. And that's one of the reasons why we generally go slow in new countries because we want to get it right from a customer experience on an operational side.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Oliver Chen from Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.\nOliver Chen: Hi. Thank you. Richard, on your digital innovation roadmap, what are your thoughts about fulfillment from in-store and micro fulfillment centers? And also thinking about the robotic capabilities across inventory management or supply chain from in-store? Would love your thoughts.\nRichard Galanti: Well, just because of what we did currently a couple of years ago, we have our business centers that act as a focal point, as you know, for today. We have our depot operations. We have moved some of that fulfillment to annexes off of some of our depots as well where we put in to our biggest depot some automation fulfillment, which I have talked about over the last few quarters or last six months and we continue to roll some of that out. One of the things we have done is, is particularly things like how do we improve the time, particularly if items that might be presented in store but are only sold online like white goods, or what I will call big and bulky and those that require not only installation but sometimes take away the old one. While many third parties do that, we do a little of it. We have also figured out what are some of these items based on our volumes that can be staged efficiently and a dozen, I am making the number up, but a dozen geographic locations across Canada and United States to take the shipping times down dramatically. And we have done some of that stuff. And that's evolved over the last couple of years and we will do more. You have got a business of just white goods and that's certainly not the only big and bulky. There is furniture. There's patio stuff. There is exercise equipment. But just on white goods, we have gone from essentially sub $50 million a year four years ago, over $650 million and growing. And part of that is not just selling the stuff at great prices, it's getting it delivered to in fewer days.\nOliver Chen: Okay. And Richard on vertical integration opportunities ahead, what are you thinking could or should be possible? And what's your framework for evaluating what makes sense for you in terms of owning more parts of the supply chain across different categories?\nRichard Galanti: Well, what started 25 years ago was a ground beef plant to save $0.04 to $0.06 a pound we thought a ground beef are now two major meat plants. One in Tracy, California where we started and one in Illinois, which is still growing into itself over the last year-and-a-half, two years since it opened. I think the one in California does well over four million pounds a week of just a handful of items that are ours. That gave us confidence to do the hot dog plant. We did almost partly by necessity a bakery commissary in Canada which we are finding can serve not only Canada but the U.S. on making more consistent and more efficiently crusted items like cookie dough and croissants. So we learn each time we do something. I think there has been some press out there about testing greenhouses for produce. We have got one up and running just in the last few months in California that I think some of the product is just starting to hit our shelves. But we think there is some great opportunities on the produce side for hothouses and greenhouses, if you will, particularly where transportation costs and time is a necessity on stuff that spoils quickly and easily. Right now, much of the produce that we ship to our Hawaii locations is air shipped. If you can do some more of that over there, that's a no-brainer. And given our volume and limited SKUs, we think that it's an efficient model to help. But that's not just us, others are trying that. Again, we think that the structure of our business allows us to take more advantage of that but it's new. I don't know if there's anything big. There is nothing as big as the chicken complex on the drawing boards. But I think we will continue to do things. But we are catching our breath a little bit right now. We have made some major investments for the second meat plant and the bakery commissary, just recently in the chicken complex and even more recently, the first of the few green hothouses. So we have got a lot going on. And the answer is, it works and so far and so good.\nOliver Chen: And my last question. Richard, Kirkland is a nice competitive advantage. What are your thoughts on how that percentage of mix may increase and categories that may be suitable for that you are not in yet? And also you cited new services that you have added to your product assortment. How will services evolve as a percentage of total? Just would love the magnitude of what may happen there over time?\nRichard Galanti: Well, first, on the Kirkland Signature side, there aren't a lot of $0.5 billion and $1 billion items like water and various paper goods and things like that. And there are many, but not a lot of many new few hundred million dollar items. But yes there's lots of $20 million and $50 million items that can go to $50 million and $100 million and certainly I think on high-end packaged food items, on everything from not only organic but antibiotic-free. And I don't have all the adjectives in front of me, but there's lots of things that we can do that are high-end that our members want. And frankly has added benefits of seemingly gets in the millennials on some of those stuff. But I think we have expanded into some sporting goods. So there is lots of little things that will add to it. But if the number and I don't have it exactly in front of me, but ex-gas if the number is 24%, 25%, does it go to 30% over the next 10 or 15 years? May be. We think this is going to go up? Yes, likely a little bit because we found ourselves and our ability and our suppliers. Some of our private label suppliers are very good at what they do. But we also are still a branded retailer. We have very good savings, as you know, on branded items. On the service side, we don't talk about it a lot because they are small relative to the size of our company, but it's other things that make the membership sticky and are very profitable, whether it's the Costco auto program or our travel business which continues to grow. We now a year or so ago when we added the hotel only booking engine and more recently the airline reservation only, not just packaged items, package trips and everything. And so I think we will keep adding things. I can't tell you what yet, but we keep looking at things.\nOliver Chen: Great. Happy holidays. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nGreg Melich: Hi. Thanks Richard. I wanted to get an update on how the private label card, now that you have had a few years for it to properly season and scale, anything you could say on the penetration or how the sales are doing outside the club? And maybe link that to what the auto-renewal rates are now as part of the renewal rates?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. I don't know what the auto-renewal rates are. They are increasing. The big issue is, when we converted, prior to conversion when it was the other provider, there was both the cobranded card plus other branded cards of that provider, like Delta SkyMiles or something. And all those non-cobrand ones, all those auto-renewals went away, went to zero. So that had to be picked up over time and we saw that impact our overall renewal rate a little bit. The other thing is, as we continue to add new increasing number of members that have the cobrand card and the value keeps getting better and bigger. And so we think that will continue to be additive. That's helped. I think overall, we have also done a better job even when somebody walks in to sign up not only to upgrade but when they like to auto-renew. And so all those things help. Certainly the Citi Visa is probably one of the biggest movers of that because of just the sheer size of it and in fact that we are still adding new cardholders to that list.\nGreg Melich: Is Citi Visa doing multiples of sales outside of the club that it's doing in the club at this point?\nRichard Galanti: There's certainly more sales being done outside as there were over the 16 years of the previous relationship, that evolved over time. As we would have expected, this would be even greater than that outside versus inside spend and that's why we have revenue share which is good for us and them presumably. From the standpoint that the Visa card is offered at more smaller businesses which tend to have higher merchant fees in general anyway. So it's a whole new additional market potential of revenue share to those people using that card. If my card is top of wallet, there are certain places previously that I couldn't use it like the local dry cleaner and restaurant. Now I can.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And then you mentioned Japan and I think it was Australia coming for e-commerce if you look around the world. Any early learnings out of the launch in Japan?\nRichard Galanti: Other than it what, well it's been two days. So I am happy to report I know nothing.\nGreg Melich: That's good to hear. Have a great holiday, Richard.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you. Laurie, we will take two more questions.\nOperator: Your next question is from Scott Mushkin from R5 Capital. Your line is now open.\nScott Mushkin: Hi Richard. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to talk a little bit about maybe growth that's being left, I mean, obviously you left on the table. Obviously, your performance is incredible. But the number of club opening has come down a little bit. You might say through omnichannel. So just as you take a step back, we look at our research, we look like you are kind of almost underserving certain markets in the U.S. How do you think about growth? Is it time to speed things up a little bit? Get back up to the 30 clubs? Maybe put a little bit more money behind omnichannel? Kind of what's the company's thought process here?\nRichard Galanti: I think I don't disagree with you. We want to open more than 20-ish this year. Part of that was, I think, some delays in how long it took overseas. We have got the pipeline filled a little bit better. And five years ago, well, I always said, our open plan is to do more than we were doing. Today, I would say the same thing. We do have, I think we will increase it a little bit, but I can't exactly say by how many and when. We are a very hands on company. And we have a lot of other things going on. And certainly there's a lot of emphasis on the e-commerce side, not only getting into few remaining countries but building it. Not because we are supposed to, but it's working. And we think that, in some cases, it's either sales that we would have lost anyway like big white goods you just don't sell those at store anymore. But we are getting people in the building still using this thing. So I think, don't expect some giant change from 20 to 30 in a couple of years. But our goal is to work harder to open a few more of those while we are doing all these other things as well.\nScott Mushkin: All right. Thanks very much.\nOperator: And your question is from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Your line is now open.\nKelly Bania: Hi Richard. Thanks for fitting me in here. Just wanted to ask about executive penetration. You called out Japan and the impact there a little bit. But just I am curious how much in the U.S. you are seeing executive penetration move higher? I know we have asked this over the years but just and where you think that could kind of level out at some point?\nRichard Galanti: When I look by country, in the U.S. and Canada where it's been the longest and we have got the most units and the most services as part of the executive membership offering, it's in the mid-70s. In other countries where it's been, like Mexico, it's in the 50s and growing. But I think it starts off lower. I don't know if the marketing department has a plan for where it could go. It's more of what do we do to get people to convert and sign up originally. And so I think there is, if I was shooting from the hip totally, at some point there's going to be some members that don't want an executive membership, period. And even if it provides them some savings. And there's some people, they want it that sometimes it's not as much savings as they thought and they revert back. But at the end of the day, I would be thrilled to think that that could go to any one day, but I have no idea where and how long it will take to get there. We know that executive members are more loyal in terms of their renewal rates. They shop more frequently and they spend more each year.\nKelly Bania: Got it. And maybe just one more on gross margin. Obviously mix impacts some other retailers more than it really impacts you. But I guess over the years, we have talked about things like private label, organics or international or even e-commerce in terms of mix shift. And just curious as you kind of look at that core on core up 4% which is clearly very stable, just what kind of mix shift is kind of underlying that?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think it's more that mix shift. I mean certainly gas has the biggest impact. Gas is more than 10% of our business. It could be a gross margin line. First of all, -- and there is deflation. And so you could have the gross margin contribution, plus or minus, by a number of basis points. You have all the services while they are small work on higher gross margins than normal because they cover the pharmacy, the pharmacists and pharmacy tax. In optical, the optometrists, things like that. And those are all growing businesses, generally growing a little faster some of them than the company. Travel, as an example, would be. In travel, some of the things are gross sales and some of them are brokerage fees. So a very high margin. There is really very little cost of sales, it's commission. But getting back to the core merchandise, private label generally is a slight positive. Although, again the percentage of stuff that's private label versus branded while growing is growing at a slower rate than it has in the past. And then there's that magic word, competition. Our view is, as we look to how do we drive the top line, how can we be the most competitive. And we are fortunate that we have different buckets to do that with. So it's hard enough for us to know where the margins are going each month and each quarter other than we want it to be flat or up a little bit and we want to grow the topline which will solve a lot of things.\nKelly Bania: Understood. Thank you.\nRichard Galanti: Okay. Well, thank you everyone. Thank you, Laurie.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Galanti",
            "content": "Thank you Laurie and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the 12 weeks ended November 24. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $844 million or $1.90 per share compared to $767 million or $1.73 a share last year in the first quarter. This year's first quarter results included a $77 million or $0.17 per share income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Last year's first quarter results included a $59 million or $0.13 per share income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Net sales for the quarter came in at $36.24 billion, a 5.6% increase over the $34.31 billion sold during the first quarter of last year. Comparable sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 in the U.S. on a reported basis was 4.7%, ex-gas deflation was 5.0%. Canada reported a 2.9%, ex-gas deflation and FX plus 5.1%. Other international reported 3.2%, ex-gas deflation and FX plus 4.5%. So total company was a 4.3% reported and ex gas deflation and FX of 5.0% E-commerce on a reported basis was a 5.5% and a 5.7% on a reported basis. Total and comparable company sales for the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately 0.5% due to Thanksgiving occurring a week later this year. E-commerce sales in the quarter were negatively impacted by an estimated 12 percentage points. So again the 5.5% and 5.7% were impacted to the negative by 12 percentage points. In terms of the Q1 comp sales metrics, first quarter traffic or shopping frequency increased 3.4% worldwide and 3.1% in the U.S. This again includes the impact of the Thanksgiving holiday shift. Weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 30 basis points and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 40 basis points. Our average transaction or ticket was up 0.9% during the quarter including the negative impacts of gas deflation, FX, and the holiday shift. Next on the income statement, membership fee income. Reported membership fee income came in at $804 million, up 6.1% or $46 million from last year's $758 million. Deflation, foreign of FX currencies would have impacted that by a $1 million to the negative. So, it would have been about $1 million higher, ex FX. In terms of renewal rates at Q1-end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rates came in at 90.9% and worldwide rate was 88.4%, both of these figures remaining at the same renewal rate levels that were achieved 12 weeks ago at the fiscal year-end. In terms of number of members at Q1-end, in terms of member households and total cardholders, at Q4-end back in, I think on September 1, we had 53.9 million member households at Q1 and 12 weeks later was 54.7 million, and total cardholders increased from fiscal year end of 98.5 million to 99.9 million at Q1 end. During the quarter, we had three new openings, all in the U.S., a business center in Dallas, Texas; and two additional Costco warehouses in Connecticut and Minnesota. We also relocated one of our units in Canada. At Q1-end, paid executive memberships totaled 21.4 million, an increase of $579,000 or 48,000 per week since Q4-end. This included the recent launch of offering executive memberships to [indiscernible] the first time as of the beginning of the fiscal year. Even taking those out, the average weekly increase would have been ex the new [indiscernible], executive members would been 41,000 a week. Going down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was higher year-over-year by 30 basis points coming in at 11.05% as compared to a year ago 10.75%, and again on a reported basis 30 ex-gas deflation would have been plus 26. Doing the little chart that we do each quarter, two columns reported ex-gas deflation. First line item would be core merchandise year-over-year in Q1 of 2020 compared to a year earlier quarter, minus 3 basis points on a reported basis and minus 6 basis points on an ex-gas deflation basis. Ancillary businesses plus 20 and plus 19. No change to the 2% reward, and other was plus 13 and plus 13. So total of plus 30 basis points on a reported basis and plus 26 ex-deflation. Now, the core merchandise component of gross margin, again lower by 3 year-over-year reported minus 6 ex-gas deflation. Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation to their own sales, core on core, if you will. Margins year-over-year were higher by 4 basis points. Subcategories within the core margins year-over-year in Q1 showed increases in hardlines, softlines, and food and sundries and a decrease in fresh foods. Nearly all of that decrease in fresh foods was the result of the initial operating losses from our new poultry complex. That will be a small headwind throughout the year. Recall that we commenced operations at the Nebraska chicken plant on September 10 with roughly a 45-week plan to get to full production and processing capacity, and we are currently on track to do so. Ancillary and other business gross margin, higher by 20 reported and 19 ex-gas deflation. The highlights in the year-over-year being gas, optical, tire shop, and hearing aids. The other, the pus 13 compared to year ago, this relates to what we mentioned last year in the quarter to adjusting our estimate of breakage on rewards for the Citi Visa cobranded card program last year, and that was again in comparison of the hit last year versus zero this year. Moving to SG&A. Our reported SGA percentage in Q1-over-Q1 year-over-year was higher by 17 basis points coming in at 10.30%, up from 10.13% last year. Ex-gas deflation SG&A was higher or worse by 13 basis points. Again, the little matrix that we do, both reported and without gas deflation, operations minus 9 basis points, meaning higher by 9 basis points versus minus 5 basis points ex deflation. Central, minus 4 and minus 4. Stock compensation, minus 4 and minus 4. For a total, again, of minus 17 and minus 13. These figures include, in terms of the core being minus 5 on an ex-gas deflation basis, this figure includes the impact from the wage increases that we talked about in the last couple of quarters that occurred. This impact relates to wage increases that occurred in March 2019, which hit the year-over-year comparison by 3 basis points to 4 basis points in the quarter. As mentioned previously, we would expect a similar impact that will occur in Q2 before we anniversary that wage increase midway through Q3. Central was higher again by four basis points year-over-year. IT was the biggest driver of the increase as we continued not only to maintain and upgrade but expand our capabilities and activities and certainly we have a lot going on there. And stock comp again minus four basis points hit there. That hit usually is in Q1 year-over-year based on the fact that we grant RSUs in that quarter and how we do things for employees 25, 30 and 35 years out. On the income statement. Next one is the pre-opening expense. It's lower by $8 million. It came in at $14 million this year in the first quarter versus $22 million. This year in the quarter, we had four total openings, three plus the relocation. Last year, we had eight total openings, six plus two relocations. All told, operating income in Q1 increased by 11.8%, coming in at $1.61 billion this year compared to $949 million last year. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $2 million higher year-over-year, $38 million this year in Q1 compared to $36 million last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher or better by $13 million. Interest income was actually higher by $11 million and others plus $2 million variance was primarily favorable FX year-over-year. Overall pre-tax income in the first quarter of 2020 was up 13%, coming in at $1.58 billion compared to last year's $935 million. In terms of income taxes, our reported tax rate in Q1 2020 was 19.1% compared to 16.9% in Q1 of last year. Both of these first quarter tax rates, this year and last year, benefited from the tax treatment of stock-based compensation, as mentioned earlier. Last year's rate also benefited from an additional discrete item, which we mentioned in the quarter last year. A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, we expect to open net new units of somewhere around 20, plus or minus, with a lot of it planned to open new openings, much of it back-loaded towards the end of the fiscal year. As of Q1-end, we had total warehouse square footage of 114 million square feet. Regarding capital expenditures. In Q1, our total spend was approximately $700 million and our estimate of CapEx for all of fiscal 2020 remains right around the $3 billion amount. In terms of e-commerce, our overall e-commerce sales on a reported basis in the quarter was a 5.5%, as I mentioned earlier and again ex-FX 5.7%. Again, those numbers, you could add roughly 12 percentage points to each of those to account for our estimate of the impact of the holiday shift. A few of the stronger departments, home furnishings, domestics, tires and pharmacy. Majors, electronics were not among those departments as we believe it was the one most impacted by the holiday shift. Total online grocery continues to grow at a faster rate than the core e-commerce comps, although again it's a still relatively small piece of the business. New online during the quarter expanded tickets offerings including airline gift cards, Lyft and Uber cards and Super Bowl packages. We also, during the quarter, launched as a test in a few locations same day prescription Rx delivery with Instacart and we launched in the quarter same-day alcohol delivery also through Instacart in California such that as of today, it's being offered in 12 states. And lastly, earlier this week, we launched our Japan e-commerce site with our Australia site planned to open in the first half of calendar 2020. In terms of tariffs, there continues to be a lot of moving parts and changes up to and including an hour ago. Currently, there are again 3.5 lists, if you will. Lists 1, 2, 3 and 4 A, totaling about $360 billion worth of imports. There were possibilities that there would be a 4B list would go into place December 15. Although the current news out today is that China and the U.S. are close to a deal and on finalizing a Phase 1 part of the trade deal. And so we will have to wait and see. In terms of the EU. Currently, again there's $7.5 billion of U.S. imports that are subject to a current 20% tariff, mostly food items like olive oil, cheese, wine, whiskey, butter cookies, et cetera. Again, last week, just last Monday, the White House announced that it proposed increase to 100% tariff on $24 billion in imports, which would include those in among other items. We will just have to wait and see where that is. I believe comments aren't even anticipated to be complete until early to mid-January. That's pretty much it on our part. Lastly, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our December sales results for the five-weeks ending Sunday, January 5 on Wednesday, January 8 after market close. And with that, I will open it up to Q&A and turn it back to Laurie. Thank you. Well, I think we planned it and with some historical knowledge of what's happened in the past when you have got the shortest period of time between Thanksgiving and Christmas. And we plan, assuming that we are going to continue to have the types of levels of comps that we have in general, recognizing sometimes there's a switch between months as example being the switching -- Thanksgiving being in November versus -- Q1 rather versus Q2 for us in our example. But so yes, we do expect to ramp up on a per day basis. We will have to wait and see where it goes. But we went into the planning, I think, with the confidence that we have had, good shopping frequency increases and good renewal rates and pretty good comps. In a word, no. Well, I think profitably for gas for us and as we have read from other retailers, big retailers that have gas stations as part of their retail concept, it's the new normal over the last few years. It has been a more profitable business. We, I think, benefit from the fact that we have seen our gallon increases on a comp basis in the very high single digits. So, we know we are taking market share. Despite increased profitability in that business, our savings in our view, when we can do price shops of competitors gas, it has never been as strong. So, we feel very good about where we are with that. Now sequentially, part of the increase, when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, last year's plus 30 or whatever, I don't have it in front of me, but whatever it was, had as much to do as what it was the year before. I think again when you read what others have said and what we have said in the last couple of quarters, it's been pretty good for all of us. So, it may be, you are not going to see that kind of delta on top of the big delta last year nor are you are going to see the big negative from that, negative from it coming back two years ago, but we will have to wait and see. We think what we have learned about gas profitability is, it could be very fleeting. Right now, it's been good as it was last quarter and as it was over the last couple of years in general, but you never know how to predict it from sometimes week to week. Well, I think generally we have said on a qualitative basis, that overall I think companies of scale and certainly we are one of those and the fact that we feel that we have had a relatively good mitigation plan, if you will, easier on a 10% tariff than a 25%. I think one thing again on top of this, our scale in general, our ability to move in and out of items, if all of your items are 25% tariff because you are a furniture retailer or whatever retailer, that's different than a company that has a small percentage of our business in that area. Like others, we have moved a few things where we can and sourced it out of other countries. I think our total China imports into the U.S. is about just a few percentage points lower than a year ago. So, nobody can do a lot of that nor can we. But generally speaking, I don't think it's -- it's hard enough for us to budget it into our numbers. What we look at is, is the fact that in some cases where the price has gone up and we have passed on all or some of it, we haven't seen an impact to the unit sales. On others, we have and we never know until it happens, which ones are more elastic than others, if you will. But at the end of the day, we think that we have done as good as anybody in terms of being able to mitigate the impact. And so again, I think the fact that our margins, our core on core margins, generally speaking, even in the departments like hardlines and softlines, have been slightly up year-over-year. And certainly, we haven't done that without first and foremost being the most competitive out there. That makes us feel that now, we don't want it to continue and we don't want List 4B to come on or anything else to go higher. But I think we have done okay by it. Well, first of all, I don't think ever we have tried to reengineer a product. We are going to try to figure out how to get the price down a little bit with the help of our suppliers. Sometimes, our own money or whatever else we can or moving a few items to another country and sometimes eliminating an item and putting something else in its place here. So I remember I think one anecdotal story would be in late calendar 2008 when the economic downturn hit hard and what hit hard in our case was a as good as our values were on $1,000 and $1,500 patio furniture, we had a lot of markdowns to take care to get through that in January, February and March when that stuff hit the floors. I can remember vividly, come June, following that when we were still in a bad economic downturn and our head of merchandising and our CEO reminding everybody, it's a budget meeting, I don't want to see us bring down the quality and stuff to hit a price point. We have taken 20, 30 years to get our members comfortable with the types of values we can bring, particularly on bettering goods. And so might we buy a few less units of something? Yes. Might we augment a little bit with some offerings? Yes. But we try not to. Well, first of all, we live it every day here and certainly and we are. It was unfortunate. Despite all the efforts to have plenty of processing capacity, if you will, there was something that incurred. When we look at the five days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, those five days on a year-over-year basis, I mean we still were up in the very high teens as a percentage on e-commerce, so consistent what we have showed you what we have currently been running. What it tells us, we could have done better than that. So we did leave something on the table there. And again, we were able to correct it. It took several hours that day, unfortunately. But rest assured, we are spending a lot of money on things like that. Well, who knows as certainly, one of the reasons why it's growing a little faster than the total sales line, a little of it's a couple of recent openings like the China opening. That's a little of it. I think more importantly, it's some of the things that we have done a much better job of getting new members to sign up as an executive remember. You saw in terms of the number of new member which is a combination of new membership signing up as executive member as well as conversions to these executive member, we are doing a better job of that as well. And of course that aside from improving membership fees, they are more loyal member that shop more frequently and renew more at a slightly higher rate. And so I think a lot of it is some of the things that we are doing, getting the growing number of members, I mean U.S. as a example here with the Citi Visa card, signing up for that and having auto-renewal as well as opting into auto-renewal on other Visa cards that somebody may choose to use at Costco. And so those are the things that help as well. I would like to think it's all related to just great value and that's more things that we offer the member, which is certainly part of it too. Yes. Well, I think it's mostly the shift of holiday. Some of it is a buildup with e-commerce and those holidays as well with more in the system. We are doing more fulfillment on that side. Again, in the few days since then, it's come down as we have expected. So I don't think there is a whole lot to read into it. Well, the thing about, if we open the chicken plant, the first chicken, if you will, went through on September 10. Hopefully 45 weeks later, there will be roughly 2.2 million chickens a week going through there. The first three months, if you will, which is Q1 here, September, October and part of most of November, you were at the lowest end of that. I don't want to straight line it completely, but it's close enough for this discussion, going from one chicken to 2.2 million chickens, if you will. There is a lot of operating cost in running the plant. And while we don't have both production lines running yet, there's just a lot of cost associated with that. It should be a diminishing drag in Q2 and then Q3 and then Q4 and then not be an issue. If I look over the last several years with that word we have stopped using completely called modernization and now it's some modernization but other things as well. We talked about in the last, I talked about in the last several quarters things like e-comm fulfillment spending a lot of money on that. A lot of that hits SG&A in terms of all that technology. The chicken plant, to some extent. We have also over the last couple of years done a reset of certain departments within IT based on wage competition in this part of the woods up here in the Northwest. So I mean there's a lot of things that go into it. And we have got a lot going on, whether it's e-comm, continued increases in infrastructure and vertical integration as well as our depot operations and modernization. So I don't know. I think that when we first started talking about modernization years ago and it was just that, as best we could we estimated originally over a few years it would be incremental 10 basis points to the company. And then quickly, we felt it could be 13 and ultimately it was 18 or 19. And then, a couple of years went on a quarter-over-quarter basis, some quarters it was six and some quarters, it was two or zero. So I think a couple of quarters ago, maybe three quarters ago, it was flat year-over-year to that impact. And I reminded people that don't read anything into that like it is an inflection point. We have a lot going on both related to modernization stuff as well as expanding as well as vertical integration. So my guess is, it will still be a negative year-over-year. There's a negative, when those negatives anniversary a year hence, will we have incremental negative net? I can't say. At some point, it's supposed to slow down. Yes. Well, no, look, it's convenience. Like anything in life out there, as you might expect, we are always asked when are you going to start to do order it online and pickup up in store, when are you going to do this, when you are going to have something else. And we kind of do things our own way. We look at all these things and this is one area that with the Instacart relationship where we have them already coming into our locations, let's give this a shot. We already have a good and growing mail-order business. We have 540-ish pharmacies around the country. But this is another opportunity. Our pharmacies are sometimes, somebody does, won't come out if they are not feeling well. And so it was an opportunity given and as density increases that should help. But you have already got these drivers delivering groceries to others, hopefully we can do this. And it is something to add to the competitive belt here. No. First of all, it's brand new. And it's just a few locations, going to roll out to a few more shortly. So we will see where it goes. Not really. I mean, look, our warehouse managers are in their locations every week. We hear about it and I hear about here every month by location or by region rather. And look, they are a good operator and a good competitor and we feel that we do a lot of things very well too. But there is nothing that I could point out. A year or so ago, we had pointed out that they have gotten a little more aggressive on fresh and some of these things ebb and flow. But at the end of the day, we feel very good about our competitive position. Well, first of all, on the rollout side that we have one other one planned which was planned previously. That's probably about a year-and-a-half away. And we will continue to look to see what we want to do next. But not a lot of change there. Overall, the location has exceeded our expectations. We have brought in additional help from neighboring places to help but the sales continue to grow, the sign ups continue to do very well there. And we will see. So we have had a great reception. We feel good about from a merchandising standpoint and maintaining a supply chain. Very good. And we are getting, I think, good reviews over there. We have also identified a few items, one in particular is again just anecdotal. we have done a very good job over there with sea cucumbers which I still have never tried. But we have found is that particularly on the West Coast in several cities where you have got customers that value that as a great item. We have done very well with it. So just like anything in life, we have found items that makes sense in other parts of our operation throughout the world. It's fun to see out there and it's a high value, high price item at a great value at Costco. I think some was pushed out, some went the warehouse and some was lost. In the scope of things, given our whole company, recognizing that e-commerce while growing faster than the rest of in-line, is still little over 5% of our company. So I don't want to be cavalier about it. We didn't excite the members that were delayed. But we feel we have got, so we extended the values that hit the 30-plus million emails that we sent out it in the early hours of Thursday. We extended those deals for an extra two days. And so we think we got some of it back. And again for that five day period, we did just fine. Frankly, we feel we did lose something that we could have done better than we had anticipated. Yes. Big ticket items are strong, particularly electronics items. The fact that back in March or April this past year, we were able now to offer a full line of Apple products including the Macs and the watches and the like. And we have done very well with those. And online, we have done even better with those. And it's not just the Apple products. It's other big ticket high-end game computers and game consoles. Big screen TVs are huge, recognizing the price and value of those things for consumers keep coming down, which is great. Those are the things that have done very well for us. Well, I think the fact is that, you are right, all the things that we do to drive value or to get better pricing or based on our volume or Kirkland Signature or whatever, just when you think it's safe to go out, we are going to use it to drive business, which we have done. We talked in the past about the monies from increasing the membership fee, the monies from the change in credit cards, the income tax reform, recognizing about a little over a third of the income tax reform went to improve hourly wages. But at the end of the day, those have given us additional monies to continue to drive value. And there are times when we see something, a particular department or something, where the margin might be very strong year-over-year. That's the first thing we look at. Even if we are giving a greater savings to the customer, is it too much? And so again, we are a for-profit business. We want to grow our topline first and that will help the other things. But we don't manage it completely to the basis point. That we would like to see it year-over-year even go up a little bit, but we have avenues to do that. Anyway, we don't know. I mean to the extent that we bought in advance certain merchandise to the extent we could, anticipating that that was going to go into place and so let's get it in before the tariff, we did. But it wouldn't change it, so as you are saying, it wouldn't change things immediately there. So if I mean, if anything, we have had a little extra inventory in advance of it. Inflation is almost a non-issue. It's not either inflation or deflation, generally speaking. I mean, yes, we mentioned they are slightly deflationary year-over-year. Tariffs is slightly inflationary of course on those limited items. Yes, proteins are up a little. My understanding, that has to do partly with China and with swine flu as well as more demand for beef. Other than that, not a lot to talk about there. What was the other part of the question? Yes. Well, we have two debt repayments coming due this week or next Monday. Next week and in mid-February totaling $1.7 billion from prior debt offerings. Beyond that, of course, cash at the end of Q1 generally is the highest level because you have started to sell more, but you haven't paid for everything yet relative to seasonal stuff or Thanksgiving and Christmas. So like our AP ratio was always the strongest on a quarterly basis. Beyond that, stay tuned. Thank you. Well, we currently have it in the U.S. and Canada in about 135 locations. It's going well. We have another 92 planned for early calendar 2020. So up above in the low 200s. And the senior operators continue to discuss it, additional rollouts with Craig, based on their performance. But overall, it's a positive. And so we will continue to do it, is my expectation. Well, first of all, I think thoughts on either of those are mutually exclusive of one another. When I look at the millions or billions of front-end seconds we save in labor, we know full well that some of it is, you don't get it all back, but even if you take a conservative amount, there is money to be saved there. More importantly, the members like it. The only thing the member doesn't like is when there is a member in front of them that is going through with their full basket and is taking longer. But generally speaking, even the high volume, the few high volume units that I have actually gone to of late, like the ones in Seattle and I use them when I am in and now they are fast, they work well and fast. So there is savings. But I think as well it improves that customer experience. As it relates to buy online and pickup in store, we continue to look at what others do and continue to scratch our head and recognizing the average Costco, even compared to our two direct competitors, is two and almost three times the volume per location, almost two times and almost three times the volume per location. So we will have to wait and see. We are still not at a point. We look at it, but we are not at a point that we are planning to do anything with that. Yes. I think it's part of the same story that we have talked about fortunately for the last few years. Apparel is a combination of both expanded Kirkland Signature as well as a few additional brands willing to sell us or expanding what they are selling us as well and great value. And it's a category in the several billions of dollars that continues to grow in roughly high single digits compared to retail apparel overall that's lot less than that. And I think I am always amazed at our monthly budget meetings when, in this case, buyers are bringing in and showing what's coming in for the new season whether it's outerwear, a few months ago outerwear for the fall or both men's, women's and children's stuff. It's beyond good. I am sitting here with my colleagues on what I am allowed to say. The average Costco in the world has somewhere in the mid to high 60,000 of member households. We have had locations in other countries in Asia where we might be at a 100,000 to 120,000 after a few years, maybe even after one or two years. This one is more than twice that. So there's lot of press in a city that is populated with 25-plus million people. Well getting to seven or eight or 10 locations in a country where a bunch of stuff is American supplied and barge shipped, not air flown, you become more efficient as you go from one to three, maybe using some third-party consolidation or storage to do high value bulk items because you don't want to run out of water or toilet paper as you may, the no-brainer items. And over time, by the time we get up to eight or 10, we want to have a bigger cross-dock with enough land to continue to expand it over time. Cross-docks in the U.S. and Canada serve 40 to 60 locations each and 40 to 60 relatively high volume locations. So we have one in Australia that serves 11 locations. That will continue to be a little bit as an economic improvement to that country as it serves 15 and 20 locations. We have opened two in Japan, essentially south to north for all of 26 or 27 locations. We plan to have a lot more there over time. So certainly, in addition, we have a lot of extra help there. We are doing big volume and we brought over additional people from Taiwan that speaks the local language and then understand our concept and we have been fortunate to have that additional history and expertise when we have gone there, but also with Costco more. So I think you have got, what is the normal once it's doing whatever volume it's doing and it's efficiently run at the warehouse, maybe you don't have all the efficiencies from cross-dock. That will take several years. But the most efficiencies are what's in the building and how many people you need to help that process and become more efficient. So I mean it takes a couple of years to do that. And that's one of the reasons why we generally go slow in new countries because we want to get it right from a customer experience on an operational side. Well, just because of what we did currently a couple of years ago, we have our business centers that act as a focal point, as you know, for today. We have our depot operations. We have moved some of that fulfillment to annexes off of some of our depots as well where we put in to our biggest depot some automation fulfillment, which I have talked about over the last few quarters or last six months and we continue to roll some of that out. One of the things we have done is, is particularly things like how do we improve the time, particularly if items that might be presented in store but are only sold online like white goods, or what I will call big and bulky and those that require not only installation but sometimes take away the old one. While many third parties do that, we do a little of it. We have also figured out what are some of these items based on our volumes that can be staged efficiently and a dozen, I am making the number up, but a dozen geographic locations across Canada and United States to take the shipping times down dramatically. And we have done some of that stuff. And that's evolved over the last couple of years and we will do more. You have got a business of just white goods and that's certainly not the only big and bulky. There is furniture. There's patio stuff. There is exercise equipment. But just on white goods, we have gone from essentially sub $50 million a year four years ago, over $650 million and growing. And part of that is not just selling the stuff at great prices, it's getting it delivered to in fewer days. Well, what started 25 years ago was a ground beef plant to save $0.04 to $0.06 a pound we thought a ground beef are now two major meat plants. One in Tracy, California where we started and one in Illinois, which is still growing into itself over the last year-and-a-half, two years since it opened. I think the one in California does well over four million pounds a week of just a handful of items that are ours. That gave us confidence to do the hot dog plant. We did almost partly by necessity a bakery commissary in Canada which we are finding can serve not only Canada but the U.S. on making more consistent and more efficiently crusted items like cookie dough and croissants. So we learn each time we do something. I think there has been some press out there about testing greenhouses for produce. We have got one up and running just in the last few months in California that I think some of the product is just starting to hit our shelves. But we think there is some great opportunities on the produce side for hothouses and greenhouses, if you will, particularly where transportation costs and time is a necessity on stuff that spoils quickly and easily. Right now, much of the produce that we ship to our Hawaii locations is air shipped. If you can do some more of that over there, that's a no-brainer. And given our volume and limited SKUs, we think that it's an efficient model to help. But that's not just us, others are trying that. Again, we think that the structure of our business allows us to take more advantage of that but it's new. I don't know if there's anything big. There is nothing as big as the chicken complex on the drawing boards. But I think we will continue to do things. But we are catching our breath a little bit right now. We have made some major investments for the second meat plant and the bakery commissary, just recently in the chicken complex and even more recently, the first of the few green hothouses. So we have got a lot going on. And the answer is, it works and so far and so good. Well, first, on the Kirkland Signature side, there aren't a lot of $0.5 billion and $1 billion items like water and various paper goods and things like that. And there are many, but not a lot of many new few hundred million dollar items. But yes there's lots of $20 million and $50 million items that can go to $50 million and $100 million and certainly I think on high-end packaged food items, on everything from not only organic but antibiotic-free. And I don't have all the adjectives in front of me, but there's lots of things that we can do that are high-end that our members want. And frankly has added benefits of seemingly gets in the millennials on some of those stuff. But I think we have expanded into some sporting goods. So there is lots of little things that will add to it. But if the number and I don't have it exactly in front of me, but ex-gas if the number is 24%, 25%, does it go to 30% over the next 10 or 15 years? May be. We think this is going to go up? Yes, likely a little bit because we found ourselves and our ability and our suppliers. Some of our private label suppliers are very good at what they do. But we also are still a branded retailer. We have very good savings, as you know, on branded items. On the service side, we don't talk about it a lot because they are small relative to the size of our company, but it's other things that make the membership sticky and are very profitable, whether it's the Costco auto program or our travel business which continues to grow. We now a year or so ago when we added the hotel only booking engine and more recently the airline reservation only, not just packaged items, package trips and everything. And so I think we will keep adding things. I can't tell you what yet, but we keep looking at things. Yes. I don't know what the auto-renewal rates are. They are increasing. The big issue is, when we converted, prior to conversion when it was the other provider, there was both the cobranded card plus other branded cards of that provider, like Delta SkyMiles or something. And all those non-cobrand ones, all those auto-renewals went away, went to zero. So that had to be picked up over time and we saw that impact our overall renewal rate a little bit. The other thing is, as we continue to add new increasing number of members that have the cobrand card and the value keeps getting better and bigger. And so we think that will continue to be additive. That's helped. I think overall, we have also done a better job even when somebody walks in to sign up not only to upgrade but when they like to auto-renew. And so all those things help. Certainly the Citi Visa is probably one of the biggest movers of that because of just the sheer size of it and in fact that we are still adding new cardholders to that list. There's certainly more sales being done outside as there were over the 16 years of the previous relationship, that evolved over time. As we would have expected, this would be even greater than that outside versus inside spend and that's why we have revenue share which is good for us and them presumably. From the standpoint that the Visa card is offered at more smaller businesses which tend to have higher merchant fees in general anyway. So it's a whole new additional market potential of revenue share to those people using that card. If my card is top of wallet, there are certain places previously that I couldn't use it like the local dry cleaner and restaurant. Now I can. Other than it what, well it's been two days. So I am happy to report I know nothing. Thank you. Laurie, we will take two more questions. I think I don't disagree with you. We want to open more than 20-ish this year. Part of that was, I think, some delays in how long it took overseas. We have got the pipeline filled a little bit better. And five years ago, well, I always said, our open plan is to do more than we were doing. Today, I would say the same thing. We do have, I think we will increase it a little bit, but I can't exactly say by how many and when. We are a very hands on company. And we have a lot of other things going on. And certainly there's a lot of emphasis on the e-commerce side, not only getting into few remaining countries but building it. Not because we are supposed to, but it's working. And we think that, in some cases, it's either sales that we would have lost anyway like big white goods you just don't sell those at store anymore. But we are getting people in the building still using this thing. So I think, don't expect some giant change from 20 to 30 in a couple of years. But our goal is to work harder to open a few more of those while we are doing all these other things as well. When I look by country, in the U.S. and Canada where it's been the longest and we have got the most units and the most services as part of the executive membership offering, it's in the mid-70s. In other countries where it's been, like Mexico, it's in the 50s and growing. But I think it starts off lower. I don't know if the marketing department has a plan for where it could go. It's more of what do we do to get people to convert and sign up originally. And so I think there is, if I was shooting from the hip totally, at some point there's going to be some members that don't want an executive membership, period. And even if it provides them some savings. And there's some people, they want it that sometimes it's not as much savings as they thought and they revert back. But at the end of the day, I would be thrilled to think that that could go to any one day, but I have no idea where and how long it will take to get there. We know that executive members are more loyal in terms of their renewal rates. They shop more frequently and they spend more each year. Well, I think it's more that mix shift. I mean certainly gas has the biggest impact. Gas is more than 10% of our business. It could be a gross margin line. First of all, -- and there is deflation. And so you could have the gross margin contribution, plus or minus, by a number of basis points. You have all the services while they are small work on higher gross margins than normal because they cover the pharmacy, the pharmacists and pharmacy tax. In optical, the optometrists, things like that. And those are all growing businesses, generally growing a little faster some of them than the company. Travel, as an example, would be. In travel, some of the things are gross sales and some of them are brokerage fees. So a very high margin. There is really very little cost of sales, it's commission. But getting back to the core merchandise, private label generally is a slight positive. Although, again the percentage of stuff that's private label versus branded while growing is growing at a slower rate than it has in the past. And then there's that magic word, competition. Our view is, as we look to how do we drive the top line, how can we be the most competitive. And we are fortunate that we have different buckets to do that with. So it's hard enough for us to know where the margins are going each month and each quarter other than we want it to be flat or up a little bit and we want to grow the topline which will solve a lot of things. Okay. Well, thank you everyone. Thank you, Laurie."

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker for today, Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you, Anne, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.  The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the Company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law.  In today's press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the 16 weeks ended August 29th. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $1.67 billion or $3.76 per share. Last year's fourth-quarter net income came in at 1.389 billion or $3.13 per diluted share. This year's fourth quarter included an $84 million pre-tax or $0.14 a share charge for the write-off of certain IT assets.  Last year's fourth quarter included a $281 million pre-tax charge or $0.47 a share of COVID -related costs. As well, it included a $36 million or $0.06 a share pre-tax charge related to the prepayment of $1.5 billion of debt partially offset by an $84 million or $0.15 per share benefit -- per share benefit for the partial reversal of a reserve related to a product tax assessment taken in the fiscal year 2019.  Net sales for the quarter increased 17.5% to $61.44 billion, up from $52.28 billion a year earlier in the fourth quarter. Comparable sales for the fourth quarter as reported an hour ago, for the 16 weeks on a reported basis, U.S. was 14.9%, excluding gas inflation and FX, the 14.9 would be 10.3% positive. Canada reported 19.5% plus, ex-gas inflation and FX 6.7%.  Other international reported 15%, without gas inflation and FX 7.3%. Total Company 15.5% reported 9.4% ex-gas inflation and FX. E-commerce, by the way, reported was 11.2% positive, ex-gas inflation, and FX 8.9%. In terms of Q4 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 9.2% worldwide and 8.8% in the US.  Our average transaction or basket was up 5.8% worldwide and 5.6% in the U.S. during the fourth quarter, that -- those numbers, including the positive impact from gas inflation and FX. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impact sales by approximately 230 basis points, whereas gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 385 basis points.  Moving down the income statement to the membership line, membership fee income for the fourth quarter came in at $1.234 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. That's up $128 million from the prior year's fourth quarter membership fee income of 1.106 billion; the $128 million represents an 11.7% increase year-over-year, excluding the benefit from positive FX the $128 million positive number would've been a $107 million positive or a 9.7% effective increase.  In terms of renewal rates at the fourth quarter end, our U.S. and Canada, renewal rate was 91.3% up 3/10 of a percentage point from 16 weeks earlier number in Q3 end. The worldwide renewal rate came in at 88.7%, also up 3/10 of a percentage point from Q3 and 16 weeks earlier.  Renewal rates are benefiting, we believe, for more members auto-renewing, as well as increased penetration of executive members who, on average, renew at a higher rate than non-executive members. Our first-year renewal rates have also improved as well during this time. In terms of the number of members at Q4 end member households and total cardholders, at Q4 fiscal year-end a few weeks ago, total paid households were 61.7 million.  That's up 1.1 million from the $60.6 million figure we shared with you 16 weeks earlier. Total cardholders came in at 111.6 million or 1.8 million higher than the 109.8 we had as of Q3 end. At Q4 end paid executive members were -- came in at 25.6 million, an increase of a little over a million new executive members. And that's during the 16-week period, as well.  Moving down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was lower year-over-year by 32 basis points, and actually excluding gas deflation, it was higher by 5 basis points.  As I usually do, I ask you to jot down two columns of numbers, a little gross margin matrix if you will. The line items will be core merchandise, ancillary -- second line item would be ancillary and other businesses, third line item would be 2% reward, fourth line item would be lifo, and last line item would be other, and then finally, the last line item would be total.  Two columns, the first one being reported year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and the second column, excluding gas inflation. So, core merchandise on a reported basis was lower year-over-year by 90 basis points, ex-gas inflation was lower minus 57 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses plus 44 on a reported basis, and plus 53 ex-gas inflation. 2% reward plus 1 basis point and minus 3 year-over-year on a report -- on ex-gas inflation.  Lifo minus 5 and minus 5 basis points, and other plus 18 and plus 17. If you add up the 2 columns, you get the total for reported, the 32 basis points as I just mentioned, and again, ex-gas inflation plus 5 basis points. Now the core merchandise component you see here are lower by 90 year-over-year and lower by 57 ex-gas inflation.  Similar to last quarters is primarily a function of sales shifting from core to ancillary versus the last year as we begin to revert back to more historical sales penetrations. Recall last year we saw a significant shift of sales out of the ancillary and other businesses and into the quarter.  In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in the fourth quarter, the core on core margins were lower by 40 basis points with non-foods slightly up, food and sundries are slightly lower year-over-year. Fresh foods was down and was the fundamental driver of the core on core being lower in the quarter. Now fresh foods are lapping exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outsized sales a year ago in Q4.  We retained some of that productivity gains -- from those productivity gains as volumes have remained high. However, we've also elected to hold, delay and/or mitigate some of the price increases in this increasingly inflationary environment over the last few months. Ancillary and other business gross margin, as you've seen the chart -- in the matrix was higher by 44 basis points and higher by 53 ex-gas inflation in the quarter.  Gasoline had a good quarter, as we are lapping year-over-year, a softer quarter due to the pandemic. We also showed improvement in a food court, optical, travel, all of which were benefited by easy compares versus last year, also due to the impacts of COVID on those businesses. Now LIFO, this is a gross margin charge that we haven't seen in this matrix for about 7 years, LIFO was lower by 5 basis points, both with and without gas inflation.  We had a $30 million LIFO charge in the quarter, the first such charge since 2014. This is a result of the continued inflationary cost pressures, which I will discuss more in a few minutes. 2% reward, higher by 1 basis point on a reported basis, but more importantly, lower by 3 basis points ex-gas inflation.  Again, implying the slightly higher penetration of sales going to the executive member and the associated rewards would become with it. And other is up 18 basis points and then up 17 ex-gas inflation. This is primarily related to COVID-related costs from a year ago. Moving to SG&A our reported SG&A in the fourth quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 45 basis points and lower or better by 13 basis points, excluding gas inflation.  The second matrix of the day, the two columns reported an ex-gas inflation and five-line items -- operations, second line items central, third-line-item stock compensation, fourth line item other, and then total, on a reported basis, core operations was lower or better by plus 19 basis points and ex-gas inflation higher by 8 basis points or minus 8 basis points. Central plus 12 and plus 8. Stock compensation, plus 2 and plus 2.  And other plus 12 and plus 11. Adding up the columns, again, SG&A on a reported basis was better or lower by 45 basis points and lower ex gas inflation by 13. As you can see in the matrix, the core operations component again was better by 19 and low -- and higher by -- lower by 19 and then -- or higher by 8 excluding the impact from gas inflation.  Keep in mind these results include the permanent $1 an hour wage increase that we implemented in March of this year. This higher by bate -- by 8 basis point year-over-year expense result, it includes the 14-basis point cost of the dollar an hour wage increase. Central again, improved by 8 basis point ex-gas inflation and stock compensation also with strong sales and helped by 2 basis points.  Now the other of plus 12, or plus 11 without gas inflation, so lower. That was the number of basis points, included in other last year was the COVID expense of $217 million or 42 basis points and the reversal of a product tax assessment reserve of $84 million or 16 basis points. This year includes the write-off of the IT assets, totaling $84 million or 14 basis points.  So, you add all those up, that's where you get the 11. Next on the income statement is pre-opening. Pre-opening this year was $35 million. Last year, $26 million, so higher by 9. Pre-opening is up year-over-year, in part due to the timing of openings. And given different amounts of pre-opening on a given location, both within the quarter and the following quarter.  All told reported operating income in the fourth quarter increased by 18% coming in at $2.275 billion this year compared to $1.929 billion a year earlier. Below the operating income line, interest expense was 52 million this year, essentially the same as 51 million a year ago. Interest income and others for the quarter were higher by $77 million year-over-year. Roughly half of that is due to favorable FX, and the other half is related to last year's fourth-quarter charge for the make-whole debt prepayment.  Overall reported pre-tax earnings in the fourth quarter of 2021, came in up 23% coming in at 2.291 billion, compared to last year's 1.869 billion. Now, our tax rate in the fourth quarter was 26.1%, higher than last year's fourth-quarter rate of 24.9. For Fiscal '22, based on our current estimates, which of course can always change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total Company tax rate to be similar to Fiscal '21, somewhere in the 26% to 27% range.  Unless of course there are changes to the U.S. corporate tax rates, we'll have to wait and see. A few other items of note, warehouse expansion for the Fiscal '21 which just ended, we opened a net opening of 20, and we actually had 22 openings including two relocations, but a total increase of 20 net units.  This year, we're looking to open at least 25 net new units, including second warehouses in each of China and France, and our first location in New Zealand. As well, we plan to relocate five locations. R regarding capital expenditures, our fourth quarter 2021 spend capital expenditure was approximately 1.09 billion.  Our full-year capital spend was 3.59 billion. As I mentioned in last quarter's call, this included a relatively recent $340 million purchase of a distribution filler -- a distribution facility on the West Coast to support our big and bulky delivery activities. For E-commerce, E-commerce sales in the fourth quarter, ex - Fx increased by 8.9% year-over-year, that's on top of last year's Q4 E-commerce sales increase of 91%. Stronger departments, Jewelry, we actually sold a couple of rings in the $100,000 range.  Home Furnishings was strong, Pharmacy was strong, and Sporting Goods was strong. A couple of other large departments like Majors and Electronics, while very good sales, we had really outsized sales a year ago, in the fourth quarter, during COVID. Update on Costco Logistics.  Logistics continues to drive big and bulky sales. For the quarter, Costco Logistics sales within our delivery were up 130%. And in the quarter represented 24% of all sales on our U.S. E-commerce site. That compares to -- that 24% compares to the 11% of e-commerce sales last year. Mind you, much of that relates to moving things from other third parties to our own internal logistics department.  Approximately -- currently approximately seven to 10 thousand daily deliveries via Costco logistics are occurring and continuing to grow. In terms of our e-com app, we have over 10 million downloads. It's continually improving with additional features coming soon. Digital payment using the Costco credit card it's in pilot in several locations with the full route with full rollout by the middle of next month.  The ability to view warehouse receipts online, also next month. More detail on online purchases as well. And by October end, we -- an improved mobile site, improved look and feel, a new landing page, and expanded information both for dot-com use and for enhanced warehouse information.  From a supply chain perspective -- I want to go back to two things supply chain and inflation. From a supply chain perspective, the factors pressuring supply chains and inflation include port delays, container shortages, COVID disruptions, shortages on various components, raw materials, and ingredients; labor cost pressures, and trucker and driver shortages -- truck and driver services.  Domestically, anecdotally rather from an -- even on a domestic side, various major brands are requesting longer lead times. In some cases, difficulty in finding drivers in trucks on short notice, lead times on ingredients and packaging have been extended in some cases.  So planning is crucial, which I feel people have done a great job that over the last several months. Also, we're putting some limitations on key items like bath tissues, roll towels, signature water, high-demand cleaning-related skews related to the uptick in adults-related demand. Furniture delays in some shortages across traditional rollout times to go from 8 to 12 weeks up to 16 to 18 weeks.  In some ways, we think that's an advantage. We're selling out the -- generally, merchandise wins once it's received within two weeks on most items and we've ordered more and earlier. The same thing with toys and Christmas, we're bringing in some of the items early. Chip shortage impacting many items, as I mentioned in the last call, examples of impacted items, computers, tablets, video games, major appliances. The feeling is from the buyers as this will likely extend into 2022.  Again, we're ordering as much as we can and getting in earlier. And I think as evidenced by most recent sales results, we're doing okay with this. Despite these issues -- sorry. In terms of transportation costs, they're increasing were reading about it every day. Containers, trucks, and drivers all are impacting the timing of deliveries and higher freight costs. Despite all these issues, we continue to work to mitigate cost increases in a variety of different ways and hold down and/or mitigate our price increases passed onto the members.  We've also chartered 3 ocean vessels for the next year to transport containers between Asia and the U.S. and Canada, and we've leased several thousand containers for use on these ships. Every ship can carry 800 to 1,000 containers at a time and we'll make approximately 10 deliveries during the course of the next year.  Moving to inflation, again, there have been many -- there have been and are a variety of inflationary pressures that we and others are seeing and -- more of it. As I discussed on last quarter's call, inflationary factors abound, higher labor costs, higher freight cost, higher transportation demand, along with container shortages and port delays, increased demand in certain product categories.  Various shortages of everything from computer chips to oils and chemicals, at higher commodities prices. That's a lot of fun right now. Some inflationary soundbites, if you will, price increases on items shipped across the oceans. Some suppliers are -- that's paying 2-6 times for containers and shipping. Price increases of pulp and paper goods, some items up 4% to 8%.  Again, we're trying to mitigate those where we can and we think we've done a decent job of mitigating some of it. Plastics, resin increases on things like dressed trash bags, Ziplock skews, pet products include -- resin oriented pet products, plastic cups, plates, plastic wrap, many items up in the 5% to 11% range. Metals, again aluminum foil, mid-single-digit crossed increases as well as cans for sodas and other beverages.  I mentioned commodities earlier, oil, coffee, nuts, they remain generally, according to our buyers at 5-year highs, and so on. Higher import prices on things from Europe, like cheeses, but the combination of freight and FX. 3% to 10% increases on certain but not all apparel items. And fresh foods inflation is up in the mid to high single-digits, with meat leading the way up high -- single to low double-digits due to the feed, labor, and transportation costs. Now, I was asked back in March at our Second Quarter Earnings Call at what level we felt inflation was running overall on the sale price side.  I stated that our best guess at the time was somewhere between 1% and 1.5%. I updated that 16 weeks earlier -- 16 weeks ago on our May 26 Third Quarter Call and we opted for the estimate to be in the 2.5% to 3.5% range. As of today, in talking with our senior merchants, we would estimate the overall price inflation of the products we're selling to be in the 3.5% to 4.5% range.  As I discussed earlier, this inflation was the driver of the $30 million LIFO charge that we took in the quarter. But all of this said, I feel -- I feel very good with the job that our merchants, our Traffic department and our operators have all been doing enable to -- in order to get the products that we need, pivot when and where necessary, and keep our warehouses full while keeping prices as low as we can for our members and continuing to show incredible value versus our competitors.  I think this is reflected in our strong reported sales and profits that we've achieved, despite challenges and our typical aggressive pricing. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results for the 5 weeks ending September, Sunday, October 3rd, on Wednesday, October 6th, after the market close. And with that, I will open it up for questions with Anne. Anne? Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We have our first question from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nSimeon Gutman: Hey, Richard. My first question is on the next fiscal year. I know you don't give a lot in terms of guidance, but wanted to ask if you think or how should we think about EBIT, whether it grows or not next year? And if you don't answer that, I was going to ask if comps grow in Fiscal '22 should EBIT grow?\nRichard Galanti: Well on the first question, of course, I can't say we don't provide guidance, but we've always talked about being a top-line company and that helps a lot of things. So, depending on what level of sales, we'll have to wait and see. We do have the dollar increases started in March, that will anniversary next February.  So, at the end of Q2, next year. But again, we've shown that even with what we view as holding the line as much as we can on pricing and being pretty aggressive there and taking that into account, we've shown that with strong sales, we can certainly improve the bottom line as well, so fingers crossed.\nSimeon Gutman: So, my follow-up may be two parts and one of them is on sales and then you mentioned the wage increase. So, on the sales side, is there anything that you're looking at or approaching differently? I know extreme value is one angle, but the timing of mailers, inventory availability looking better, is it ancillary than hasn't recovered. What can you do on the top line given how big of a lap?  And then you mentioned the wage increases, and I know you'll lap those in March, but you've seen that Amazon and Walmart have moved up, and so I'm curious how do you think about, or should we expect another increase in terms of wages?\nRichard Galanti: Sure. Well, first of all, as it relates to all the anecdotal comments I made about supply chain and inflation, I think overall we feel that we're doing a heck of a job in that stuff. And I think some of the advantages we have is that we certainly have the financial ability to bring in things early or to order early and to mitigate whatever delay may have occurred.  We certainly have the space to keep some of this stuff, most particularly because of our Costco Logistics acquisition a year ago, two additional storage space if you will. Not that we're having an issue with that because it's turning pretty fast, and the fact that we're able to pivot, we are bringing in new items. We're bringing in items off-season for Christmas, not -- pre - COVID it was toys, and trim at home, and electronics. Today it's all those things, plus things for the house, from barbecue grills, even summer items. But anything you can get your hands on. And again, I think we've done a very good job of adding suppliers where we can, and also making sure we're coming up with new items and being creative and innovative, even on the food and sundries side.  So, I think from that standpoint, despite sometimes looking at each other, the merchants and the traffic people never need to say, boy, when this is going to end? The fact is, I think we're doing a very good job with that. So, from an inventory standpoint, for those of you who several of you do go and visit our locations on a random basis, they're full, they look good compared to some of the pictures we see from others sometimes.  And so, I feel from that standpoint, we have a good issue. With inflation, to the extent that there are permanent inflationary items, like freight costs, or even somewhat permanent for the next year, we can't hold on to all those, some of that has to be passed on and it is being passed on.  We're pragmatic about it, but we recognize that since things have been so successful and our sales have been strong, we can hold the line on some of those things and do a little better job, hopefully, do a better job than some of our competitors have, and be even that more extreme in the value. So, I think, all those things, so far, at least despite the challenges have worked in our favor a little bit.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Thanks, Richard.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS, your line is now open.\nMichael Lasser: Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question, Richard. In the past, what you\u2019ve said is that Costco's profitability tends to draft up the profitability of the overall retail sector. In the last year-and-a-half, the profitability of the overall retail sector has moved nicely higher. Also, Costco's profitability, its margins have moved nicely higher. Do you view this as sustainable?\nRichard Galanti: Well, first of all, let me finish, Simeon had one other question on wages, and let me just respond to that. Look, we're known for always being one of the best wage packages and benefits packages and take care of our employee\u2019s package out there in big retail and big boxes, and all forms of big retail.  And even if - we raised our lowest, our starting wage to that 16 and 16.50 of late, mind you, our average hourly wage in the U.S. is slightly north of 24, with a very healthy employee benefit plan. We will do whatever it takes to continue to that -- that model.  Who knows when and where, but we feel pretty good about where we are. And but as many of you on the call know, irrespective of what's going on with our Company in terms of strong sales or weak sales, we will do what's right by our employees. And Michael, I'm sorry, can I go back to your question?\nMichael Lasser: Yeah. The question was, we've seen an improvement in profitability across retail and that tends to influence the profitability or profit margins of Costco. Do you view this improvement to your profit margin as sustainable from here?\nRichard Galanti: Okay. Well look, I think the anomaly over the last year-and-a-half has been that when a lot of big boxes or big retailers were enjoying comps pre-COVID in the -- I'll call it the two to 4% range of the two to 5% range, and we're enjoying 5, 6s, 7s, now we've been enjoying mid-teens or effectively low-to-mid teens over, and we've taken some market share from others.  We think that some of that will stick, and we hope it will stick, and we feel pretty good right now about what we've done and what we've accomplished. To the extent that we can generate greater than industry average comps. I think - and there - they don't have to be in the low-to-mid teens, they could still be in the mid-to-high singles that we could -- should continue to improve. But I guess I get back to the comment that has been reinforced internally from the beginning of time, we are a top-line Company and everything else will take care of itself.\nMichael Lasser: Got it. My second questions on your gross margin. There's a lot of moving pieces, as there are a lot of moving pieces with everything that's happening with Costco right now, but specifically, you're giving back some of the core-on-core gross margin gains that you experienced some really strong price sales last year. But on the other hand, your ancillary businesses are doing really well.  So, is that dynamic where you're making up for the pressure on the fresh with strong ancillary, is that sustainable? And as part of that, the perception is that Costco tends to raise prices at a slower rate than others in the retail landscape, which tends to pressure its margins as inflation is heating up. What would be different this time to make that not happen? Thank you.\nRichard Galanti: I think -- your first part of your question, I think tells part of the tale is there are so many moving parts. If you look at gasoline, which is an - it is 10%+ of our sales. It's a huge business that can have huge variations of gross margin.  Knock-on-wood, always profitable, but it's still quite a range of gross margin. And that's more reflective of what's going on with competition in the retail gasoline market. We feel that sometimes other large retailers of gasoline, are looking to make a little more, which gives us the ability to be quite profitable but still show even bigger savings.  So, there are lots of puts and takes. Certainly, from last year, you had roughly a 16-week period, where our Optical and our Hearing Aid Centers were outright closed. Travel went to literally having negative revenue because it was not having a new business and it was refunding previously booked business at the trough of COVID, and so there's that kind of anomalies.  Again, I get back to thinking that due to the unfortunate thing called COVID, some businesses have benefited in the sense that we were essential, in the sense that our [cavernous] (ph) places like we feel that people felt comfortable coming in to the extent that we are able merchandise-wise to have pivoted and maintain notwithstanding supply chain issues, maintain exciting full warehouses of merchandise. So, I think those are the things that help us.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you very much, Richard.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Your line is now open.\nCharles Grom: Hey, thanks. Richard, if inflation stays up in that 3.5% to 4.5% range over the next couple of quarters, would you expect that LIFO charge to be about 30 million per quarter or could we adjust it per weaker -- years ago you used to have that charge every quarter or sometimes the credit, just wondering how we handle that from here?\nRichard Galanti: Yeah. It's hard to say. I wouldn't just say it's that much based on that. It really depends. And mind you, when you have -- again, we've enjoyed a number of years of effectively very little, if any, or no LIFO or eating into our previous LIFO credit 5 and 6 years ago. But what -- if there was consistent inflation going forward for the next 2, 3, 4 quarters, you're going to also see some price increases to those customers.  And I might say some, there's been some already, but in our view, there is less than we could've done. And that will continue and I think the more consistent inflation -- if inflation raise stayed at this level, and we don't know that, but if it did stay at this level even with a LIFO charge, in some ways, it will be offset by price increases. [Indiscernible].\nCharles Grom: Okay. Okay. Great, thanks. And then on a -- just a follow-up, and then on the labor front, I'm curious if you guys have observed an increase in applications in roughly 20 states that ended unemployment benefits on September 1st. There's a number of companies have spoken to a big increase in job applications recently.\nRichard Galanti: I don't know the -- I haven't asked and I don't know the answer to that. It makes sense.\nCharles Grom: Okay. All right. Good luck. Thanks.\nRichard Galanti: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nKaren Short: Hi, thanks very much. I just want to clarify one thing on that last line of questioning, in terms of the LIFO charge, was this 30 million a catch-up for the whole year, or was that something that was reflective of the quarter itself? Because to get that, speaks to the run rate.\nRichard Galanti: It's the quarter, it's basically if you take your cost -- silos of inventory and what was it at Q3 end and what is it now at Q4 end.\nKaren Short: Okay. So, I guess obviously as you lifted all these different pressure points on pricing, I guess my bigger picture question is, how do you think about the membership fee structure in general?  There are all these pressures on I guess your business, but also on the consumer from the inflationary standpoint, make you more likely, less likely, or how does it impact your membership fee increase decision process?\nRichard Galanti: What we've said over the years is that certainly, we look at our gross profit as a combination of a gross margin plus a membership fee. But we really don't look at it together in that way you that, \"Hey, if we do something with the membership fee, we could be more aggressive on pricing. \" I remember years ago somebody had asked when the economy had softened and our comps did weaken a little bit and we were coming up on that fifth anniversary - ish of a pending increase and somebody said, given the economy's weaker you and your sales have weakened a little bit, still a positive number, but weakened a little bit.  Would you still do it? And the response at the time was more likely we will do it because that's what we do. We could drive lower prices with it and drive more business. And so, we really do -- we look at the loyalty and certainly, the loyalty and renewal rates have been up. [Indiscernible] If obviously, we're still a way away from anniversarying the last 5th year or so, the 5th plus year anniversarying of the last increase. So, we're a little way from thinking about it.\nKaren Short: Okay. And then just a -- we had a conference today with some large-cap names that indicated that their new view on what their actual cash balance should be going forward relative to pre-pandemic had actually increased. So, wondering if you could just talk about your perspective on what you think the rate the rate of sustainable cash balance could be because obviously, you are still sitting on a pretty hefty excess cash balance now.\nRichard Galanti: I think if the -- we've always been considered to have more cash and have a more conservative balance sheet. I think as the world is saying that they think that it should be going up more. I don't think we've thought about it going up more.  In fact, when we did the capital raise in April of '20 and related specifically to what if -- was the worst-case of COVID, once -- 6 months later, we saw that we didn't need it. We probably gave it back to our shareholders and then a little.  So, I think the other anomaly has been is we've been blessed with a very good fiscal year. The last year and a half in terms of net income and operating cash flow relative to our CAPEX, our regular dividend, and the special, let's say that kind of offset the capital -- the debt we did. So, at the end of the day, I don't see us changing our MO in that at this point.\nKaren Short: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nChris Horvers: Thanks. How all stay good prior to the price [Indiscernible] I guess if I'm interpreting what you're saying is it basically, it's because these pressures seem more structural in nature and because the demand environment is so good, you feel less compelled to be more aggressive on price, and if the environment slows, then that could change your calculus?\nRichard Galanti: It's really all about the value proposition. Are -- if anything, I think from the outside, people would look at us relative to other retailers and say we've been more aggressive on holding prices than others, at least that's how we feel.  But we have to be pragmatic as these things are permanent consistent. You've got to raise the price; we can't be completely noble here. But we feel that if anything, that moat has probably widened a little bit for us and that's great, we like wider moats.\nChris Horvers: So, the third variable being those others are raising prices faster than you, so the price gaps have widened.\nRichard Galanti: That's our view. That's our buyer's view. But we're looking at, frankly, given how strong it's been, and in our DNA, we hate raising prices. We want to be the last to raise it and the first to lower it. Is in our DNA not even -- putting on shades on the side and not even looking, at others.  We're looking at how do we drive our own business and we know that being the most -- the best value out there and having great merchandise and all that other wonderful stuff is how you do it. And as we've seen such strength in our numbers, and then as we've encountered rising levels in inflation, where can we hold the price on some things? And that's what we do. It's an art form more than a science. But it seems to work for us.\nChris Horvers: For sure. So, my second question is on the membership fee MFI growth X to FX benefit that you've seen, that number is accelerated the past two quarters. So, is it -- given that the accounting of this is over a 12-month basis, you have a view -- you have some inkling on what that growth could be as you look forward? Higher renewal rates, obviously, taking a ton of share, should all else equal that level? Again, MFI growth Ex Fx continues to accelerate?\nRichard Galanti: Well, the big answer is we hope so. The fact that we are opening more units in '21 than we did in '20 is a positive. The fact that there are several international units that tends to have higher growth rates. The fact that Auto Renew is kind of a freebie in the sense that more people getting -- signing up and putting your credit card on their application -- in their application or signing up for the -- more importantly, signing up for the Citi Visa card.  That helps you a little bit driving the Executive Member, getting more people today -- if every 100 people signing up today, I think a little over half, I don't have an exact number, sign up as an executive member.  I remember 6, 7 years ago, or 8 years ago, it was half that percentage. And these are rough numbers, so don't hold me to them. But at the end of the day, executive members, by its definition, have higher renewal rates. They shop more frequently; they buy more stuff. So, all of that stuff is -- that -- those are all good factors for us.\nChris Horvers: And just one quick last one I have you shared how many -- the percentage of your membership that has -- in the U.S. that have the Citi Bank private label card?\nRichard Galanti: I don't think we have.\nChris Horvers: Okay. Thanks. Best of luck.\nRichard Galanti: By the way, before the next question, somebody checked a number, but we have seen a recent increase in applications in the last couple of weeks. I think Chuck asked that. Okay?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citi. Your line is now open.\nBrandon Cheatham: Hey everyone, it's Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. Gonna take a stab at the membership question as well. You know you have some great memberships statistics; it sounds like you're offering great value in the club. I was wondering, are you thinking about not investing as much in the new member promotions? Anything that you could talk about there, has that looked similar to last year, or has that increased?\nRichard Galanti: No, I think -- when you say member promotions what do you mean?\nBrandon Cheatham: I think right now you're offering $40 on a Costco cash card if you sign up.\nRichard Galanti: Oh, marketing. We did -- we do a variety of things. Not a huge basis, but we tried some things in the last few years. We've done some things with Groupon and with, one other one -- Living Social.  We've done some things as you've mentioned, but those are not on -- there I'd say they're on a regular -- irregular basis and we try different things all the time, but I know -- I think that's really, frankly, independent of looking at the membership fee itself.  It's really about how do we drive memberships and what is the incremental cost? What is the true cost of acquiring a new member other than waiting for them to go online or walk into the warehouse to sign up themselves? And so, we're always trying some new things.\nBrandon Cheatham: Got it. And you mentioned your own chartered ships. I was just wondering what percentage of your shipping that would represent next year.\nRichard Galanti: Less than 20%.\nBrandon Cheatham: Less than 20. Got it.\nRichard Galanti: Less than 20% of our Asia shipping.\nBrandon Cheatham: Got it, okay. And the last one for me, on the e-com side, I was just wondering your customer that shops there, do they visit the store as frequently as a member that doesn't shop online?\nRichard Galanti: I don't know that off the top of my head. What I -- and I don't have all the specific statistics in front of us. All the charts that we look at keep going in the right direction. The number of people that bought online, percentage of members, the hit rate when we do something on an e-mail to get people to do something online.\nBobNelson: What we do know is when we shop online and, in the warehouse, you typically shop maybe a few less times in the warehouse, but you overall spend more.\nRichard Galanti: What Bob has mentioned, thank you, Bob, is that when you are -- if you take a regular, loyal member and when they do start shopping online, they may shop a few times less in-store, but the aggregate of the two is greater than their historical.  Which makes up? By the way, the other thing there is that the online, while we're constantly putting on what I'll call greater frequently traffic building items velocity items. And like apparel and health and beauty aids and things like that. The fact that matter is more and more big and bulky items are bought online.  Years ago, if you wanted to buy a mattress or a refrigerator, you had to go buy it and pick it up and take it home. We didn't deliver. We didn't install it. That's of course changed in the last many years and we have an Appliance business in the U.S. that's well over a billion dollars and growing fast -- continue to grow fast, helped by Costco Logistics. So that changes the metric a little bit too.\nBrandon Cheatham: Great. Thanks for the additional color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Baker from Davidson. Your line is now open.\nMike Baker: Hi. Thanks. Two questions for me. One, you did allude to the Delta variant and having to limit some products in areas where we've seen higher cases. So, could you just talk about overall different trends that you might be seeing in areas that are seeing bigger spikes in the new COVID variant versus others?\nRichard Galanti: I don't know. I don't have in front of me any detail by region in that regard. What I do know is, like everything right now it's all over the board. We're talking -- I forget what cleaning supply it was, whether it was Clorox, or Lysol, or some type of antibacterial wipe or whatever it was.  But there had been -- a year ago there was a shortage of merchandise, now they've got plenty of merchandise, but there's 2 to 3-week delays on getting it delivered because there's a limit on short-term changes to trucking and delivery needs of the supplier. So, it really is all over the board.\nMike Baker: And maybe as part of that, any seeing anything in terms of the travel trends, which now we're coming back really strong as last quarter.\nRichard Galanti: Yes.\nMike Baker: But has Delta reverted that at all?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Yes. If you look to the chart, which went down, so it's that -- last summer or last spring it was negative, more refunds than new things being bought. It really got back to almost normal. I'm talking about, bookings of resort vacations and -- to Hawaii and to Mexico and things like that.  And just a month ago -- month-and-a-half, two months ago, at the monthly budget being the charts were showing us it's almost back to where it was pre-COVID. And then it fell like a rock, not as bad as it was at its drought last spring, but it's certainly calmed down. Cars were not hit as bad, but that will fluctuate based on, again, what's going on out there.\nMike Baker: That all makes sense. One more quick one that was one question in two parts. Can you update us on the curbside pickup test that you were running in New Mexico, I think as of last time we spoke it was in 3 stores?\nRichard Galanti: Right. We're currently not doing it. We discontinued it, for now, we'll try some new things somewhere sometime, but at this point, we got a lot of good things going on and we really didn't see a lot of traction in it.\nMike Baker: Interesting. Thanks for the call, I appreciate the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Betti from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nRupesh Betti: Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. So, I guess just going back to the core margin. So, it sounded like at least this past quarter on the pricey side, you guys delayed passing through some of the price increases. So, if you look at non-foods versus your foods categories, is it generally easier to pass through on the non-food side versus the food side?\nRichard Galanti: I wouldn't say that. I think food -- fresh turns so fast, it turns more than 50 times a year or whatever. And we've got a hot price on strip steaks or keeping the rotisserie chicken and for $0.99, that's going to impact you a little faster.\nUnidentified Representative: [Indiscernible]\nRichard Galanti: But the comment here is that we're not going to change the price of muffins every week. So, we'll take a little less margin on some items. I think it's all over the board. But at the end of the day, it's an art form, not a science, or not straight across, we're going to do this much on every item.\nRupesh Betti: Okay, great. And then the second question, just as you look at your Service business, Optical, Food Court, et cetera, where are we versus where you were pre-pandemic? Have those businesses fully recovered at this point?\nRichard Galanti: Mostly. Pharmacy and Optical have. Food courts have come back, Hearing Aids not quite yet, but much better than it was at its trough --\nUnidentified Representative:  [Indiscernible]\nRichard Galanti: And Travel is lots of fun based on what's going on with COVID.\nRupesh Betti: Okay, great. And one final question. I mean, I may have missed this in your prepared comments. Did you guys give a forecast for CAPEX for the upcoming fiscal year?\nRichard Galanti: No, it will have a three in front of it.\nRupesh Betti: Okay. Okay. Thank you. Best of luck, the balance of the year.\nUnidentified Representative: One more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. Your line is now open.\nJohn Heinbockel: So, Richard, you said it's an art, not a science. I'm curious where you guys sit on data science and analytics around price elasticity, 1. And 2, personalization of the monthly mailer or monthly e-mails. Where are we on that journey?\nRichard Galanti: First of all, as it relates to pricing and elasticity, I think if we were considered the best Company in the world with data analytics, we would still not use it for price elasticity. We're going to do what we do as merchants and look at competitive prices, and see how low we can mark something up.  And the old saying from years ago, we want to improve margins and lower prices at the same time by buying better and doing those things. So, I don't see that happening at all. As it relates to the other aspect of that, that's coming. We made a big investment in what I'll call data analytics for us because we went from darn near 0 to something.  But brought on a VP of data analytics a year ago in March. There's been a lot of progress, a lot of focus to date has been on the merchandising side, providing better tools to buy and to project, and things like that. I think you'll see more of that over the next year, but again, we're getting there.  I always look at it as just some of the things that others are doing that will help. It's low-hanging fruit for us because we haven't done it yet, but we'll keep going. But that's where a lot of the data analytic function to date in this past year as we built a department around it, has been just that.\nJohn Heinbockel: And then secondly, one of the things you guys have been known for is seasonally getting in and out before everybody else. So, you lean into that in an environment where it's hard to chase product, getting it early, people buy it, and they're done for the season. Do you lean into that more in terms of where you can more inventory, get it in the clobber, or is there a limitation because you've got a transition from one season to the next?\nRichard Galanti: I think there's a little bit of both. There is a little bit of taking it where you can get it right now, and certainly, we're consciously bringing in. I think I mentioned even what was the furniture where the cycle has gone from 12 and 14 weeks to 16 and 18, we're bringing in early. And certainly, on seasonal things, we'll do that on some items. But it's a mixed bag just because we're pivoting and blocking and tackling in 12 different directions like everybody.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay. Thank you.\nRichard Galanti: We have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Your line is now open.\nKelly Bania: Hi, thanks for fitting me in, Richard. Just wanted to ask one more on the inflation you mentioned that the 3.5 to 4.5 range, just want to clarify that is retail inflation? Just curious what your cost inflation is, and just trying to get a sense of how much you're absorbing. And maybe if you can just provide some examples of how Costco and the merchants are mitigating some of the pressures.\nUnidentified Representative:  [Indiscernible]\nRichard Galanti: It's both. I am sorry, what? Margins have generally stayed the same, I mean, we gave you some examples on the side of the fresh food, where it's changed and why, but generally speaking, I think there is, again, a lot of moving parts and we continue to figure out how to balance it.\nKelly Bania: Any examples you want to provide about how you're mitigating some of the pressures?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I mean, I'm not on a specific product example, but the fact is, one we've got strong relationships and good buying power with our vendors. When we're eating a little bit into something, we're asking in some cases for them to eat a little bit into it. During these times, we're constantly figuring out how to be where they're any cost savings to offset some of the cost increases.  Whether it's packaging or whatever it might be. And so, I mean, I think one of the things that help us is that we're worried about managing 3,800 items, not 100,000 items or 50,000 items, and that's helped us. Yeah, there are times where we'll be pivoting in and out of items for that reason also. Sorry to be vague but it really is, there are just so many different things out there.\nKelly Bania: Right. Thank you.\nRichard Galanti: Well, thank you, everyone will be around for any additional questions, and have a good week and talk to you next time.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Galanti",
            "content": "Thank you, Anne, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.  The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the Company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law.  In today's press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the 16 weeks ended August 29th. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $1.67 billion or $3.76 per share. Last year's fourth-quarter net income came in at 1.389 billion or $3.13 per diluted share. This year's fourth quarter included an $84 million pre-tax or $0.14 a share charge for the write-off of certain IT assets.  Last year's fourth quarter included a $281 million pre-tax charge or $0.47 a share of COVID -related costs. As well, it included a $36 million or $0.06 a share pre-tax charge related to the prepayment of $1.5 billion of debt partially offset by an $84 million or $0.15 per share benefit -- per share benefit for the partial reversal of a reserve related to a product tax assessment taken in the fiscal year 2019.  Net sales for the quarter increased 17.5% to $61.44 billion, up from $52.28 billion a year earlier in the fourth quarter. Comparable sales for the fourth quarter as reported an hour ago, for the 16 weeks on a reported basis, U.S. was 14.9%, excluding gas inflation and FX, the 14.9 would be 10.3% positive. Canada reported 19.5% plus, ex-gas inflation and FX 6.7%.  Other international reported 15%, without gas inflation and FX 7.3%. Total Company 15.5% reported 9.4% ex-gas inflation and FX. E-commerce, by the way, reported was 11.2% positive, ex-gas inflation, and FX 8.9%. In terms of Q4 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 9.2% worldwide and 8.8% in the US.  Our average transaction or basket was up 5.8% worldwide and 5.6% in the U.S. during the fourth quarter, that -- those numbers, including the positive impact from gas inflation and FX. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impact sales by approximately 230 basis points, whereas gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 385 basis points.  Moving down the income statement to the membership line, membership fee income for the fourth quarter came in at $1.234 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. That's up $128 million from the prior year's fourth quarter membership fee income of 1.106 billion; the $128 million represents an 11.7% increase year-over-year, excluding the benefit from positive FX the $128 million positive number would've been a $107 million positive or a 9.7% effective increase.  In terms of renewal rates at the fourth quarter end, our U.S. and Canada, renewal rate was 91.3% up 3/10 of a percentage point from 16 weeks earlier number in Q3 end. The worldwide renewal rate came in at 88.7%, also up 3/10 of a percentage point from Q3 and 16 weeks earlier.  Renewal rates are benefiting, we believe, for more members auto-renewing, as well as increased penetration of executive members who, on average, renew at a higher rate than non-executive members. Our first-year renewal rates have also improved as well during this time. In terms of the number of members at Q4 end member households and total cardholders, at Q4 fiscal year-end a few weeks ago, total paid households were 61.7 million.  That's up 1.1 million from the $60.6 million figure we shared with you 16 weeks earlier. Total cardholders came in at 111.6 million or 1.8 million higher than the 109.8 we had as of Q3 end. At Q4 end paid executive members were -- came in at 25.6 million, an increase of a little over a million new executive members. And that's during the 16-week period, as well.  Moving down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was lower year-over-year by 32 basis points, and actually excluding gas deflation, it was higher by 5 basis points.  As I usually do, I ask you to jot down two columns of numbers, a little gross margin matrix if you will. The line items will be core merchandise, ancillary -- second line item would be ancillary and other businesses, third line item would be 2% reward, fourth line item would be lifo, and last line item would be other, and then finally, the last line item would be total.  Two columns, the first one being reported year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and the second column, excluding gas inflation. So, core merchandise on a reported basis was lower year-over-year by 90 basis points, ex-gas inflation was lower minus 57 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses plus 44 on a reported basis, and plus 53 ex-gas inflation. 2% reward plus 1 basis point and minus 3 year-over-year on a report -- on ex-gas inflation.  Lifo minus 5 and minus 5 basis points, and other plus 18 and plus 17. If you add up the 2 columns, you get the total for reported, the 32 basis points as I just mentioned, and again, ex-gas inflation plus 5 basis points. Now the core merchandise component you see here are lower by 90 year-over-year and lower by 57 ex-gas inflation.  Similar to last quarters is primarily a function of sales shifting from core to ancillary versus the last year as we begin to revert back to more historical sales penetrations. Recall last year we saw a significant shift of sales out of the ancillary and other businesses and into the quarter.  In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in the fourth quarter, the core on core margins were lower by 40 basis points with non-foods slightly up, food and sundries are slightly lower year-over-year. Fresh foods was down and was the fundamental driver of the core on core being lower in the quarter. Now fresh foods are lapping exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outsized sales a year ago in Q4.  We retained some of that productivity gains -- from those productivity gains as volumes have remained high. However, we've also elected to hold, delay and/or mitigate some of the price increases in this increasingly inflationary environment over the last few months. Ancillary and other business gross margin, as you've seen the chart -- in the matrix was higher by 44 basis points and higher by 53 ex-gas inflation in the quarter.  Gasoline had a good quarter, as we are lapping year-over-year, a softer quarter due to the pandemic. We also showed improvement in a food court, optical, travel, all of which were benefited by easy compares versus last year, also due to the impacts of COVID on those businesses. Now LIFO, this is a gross margin charge that we haven't seen in this matrix for about 7 years, LIFO was lower by 5 basis points, both with and without gas inflation.  We had a $30 million LIFO charge in the quarter, the first such charge since 2014. This is a result of the continued inflationary cost pressures, which I will discuss more in a few minutes. 2% reward, higher by 1 basis point on a reported basis, but more importantly, lower by 3 basis points ex-gas inflation.  Again, implying the slightly higher penetration of sales going to the executive member and the associated rewards would become with it. And other is up 18 basis points and then up 17 ex-gas inflation. This is primarily related to COVID-related costs from a year ago. Moving to SG&A our reported SG&A in the fourth quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 45 basis points and lower or better by 13 basis points, excluding gas inflation.  The second matrix of the day, the two columns reported an ex-gas inflation and five-line items -- operations, second line items central, third-line-item stock compensation, fourth line item other, and then total, on a reported basis, core operations was lower or better by plus 19 basis points and ex-gas inflation higher by 8 basis points or minus 8 basis points. Central plus 12 and plus 8. Stock compensation, plus 2 and plus 2.  And other plus 12 and plus 11. Adding up the columns, again, SG&A on a reported basis was better or lower by 45 basis points and lower ex gas inflation by 13. As you can see in the matrix, the core operations component again was better by 19 and low -- and higher by -- lower by 19 and then -- or higher by 8 excluding the impact from gas inflation.  Keep in mind these results include the permanent $1 an hour wage increase that we implemented in March of this year. This higher by bate -- by 8 basis point year-over-year expense result, it includes the 14-basis point cost of the dollar an hour wage increase. Central again, improved by 8 basis point ex-gas inflation and stock compensation also with strong sales and helped by 2 basis points.  Now the other of plus 12, or plus 11 without gas inflation, so lower. That was the number of basis points, included in other last year was the COVID expense of $217 million or 42 basis points and the reversal of a product tax assessment reserve of $84 million or 16 basis points. This year includes the write-off of the IT assets, totaling $84 million or 14 basis points.  So, you add all those up, that's where you get the 11. Next on the income statement is pre-opening. Pre-opening this year was $35 million. Last year, $26 million, so higher by 9. Pre-opening is up year-over-year, in part due to the timing of openings. And given different amounts of pre-opening on a given location, both within the quarter and the following quarter.  All told reported operating income in the fourth quarter increased by 18% coming in at $2.275 billion this year compared to $1.929 billion a year earlier. Below the operating income line, interest expense was 52 million this year, essentially the same as 51 million a year ago. Interest income and others for the quarter were higher by $77 million year-over-year. Roughly half of that is due to favorable FX, and the other half is related to last year's fourth-quarter charge for the make-whole debt prepayment.  Overall reported pre-tax earnings in the fourth quarter of 2021, came in up 23% coming in at 2.291 billion, compared to last year's 1.869 billion. Now, our tax rate in the fourth quarter was 26.1%, higher than last year's fourth-quarter rate of 24.9. For Fiscal '22, based on our current estimates, which of course can always change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total Company tax rate to be similar to Fiscal '21, somewhere in the 26% to 27% range.  Unless of course there are changes to the U.S. corporate tax rates, we'll have to wait and see. A few other items of note, warehouse expansion for the Fiscal '21 which just ended, we opened a net opening of 20, and we actually had 22 openings including two relocations, but a total increase of 20 net units.  This year, we're looking to open at least 25 net new units, including second warehouses in each of China and France, and our first location in New Zealand. As well, we plan to relocate five locations. R regarding capital expenditures, our fourth quarter 2021 spend capital expenditure was approximately 1.09 billion.  Our full-year capital spend was 3.59 billion. As I mentioned in last quarter's call, this included a relatively recent $340 million purchase of a distribution filler -- a distribution facility on the West Coast to support our big and bulky delivery activities. For E-commerce, E-commerce sales in the fourth quarter, ex - Fx increased by 8.9% year-over-year, that's on top of last year's Q4 E-commerce sales increase of 91%. Stronger departments, Jewelry, we actually sold a couple of rings in the $100,000 range.  Home Furnishings was strong, Pharmacy was strong, and Sporting Goods was strong. A couple of other large departments like Majors and Electronics, while very good sales, we had really outsized sales a year ago, in the fourth quarter, during COVID. Update on Costco Logistics.  Logistics continues to drive big and bulky sales. For the quarter, Costco Logistics sales within our delivery were up 130%. And in the quarter represented 24% of all sales on our U.S. E-commerce site. That compares to -- that 24% compares to the 11% of e-commerce sales last year. Mind you, much of that relates to moving things from other third parties to our own internal logistics department.  Approximately -- currently approximately seven to 10 thousand daily deliveries via Costco logistics are occurring and continuing to grow. In terms of our e-com app, we have over 10 million downloads. It's continually improving with additional features coming soon. Digital payment using the Costco credit card it's in pilot in several locations with the full route with full rollout by the middle of next month.  The ability to view warehouse receipts online, also next month. More detail on online purchases as well. And by October end, we -- an improved mobile site, improved look and feel, a new landing page, and expanded information both for dot-com use and for enhanced warehouse information.  From a supply chain perspective -- I want to go back to two things supply chain and inflation. From a supply chain perspective, the factors pressuring supply chains and inflation include port delays, container shortages, COVID disruptions, shortages on various components, raw materials, and ingredients; labor cost pressures, and trucker and driver shortages -- truck and driver services.  Domestically, anecdotally rather from an -- even on a domestic side, various major brands are requesting longer lead times. In some cases, difficulty in finding drivers in trucks on short notice, lead times on ingredients and packaging have been extended in some cases.  So planning is crucial, which I feel people have done a great job that over the last several months. Also, we're putting some limitations on key items like bath tissues, roll towels, signature water, high-demand cleaning-related skews related to the uptick in adults-related demand. Furniture delays in some shortages across traditional rollout times to go from 8 to 12 weeks up to 16 to 18 weeks.  In some ways, we think that's an advantage. We're selling out the -- generally, merchandise wins once it's received within two weeks on most items and we've ordered more and earlier. The same thing with toys and Christmas, we're bringing in some of the items early. Chip shortage impacting many items, as I mentioned in the last call, examples of impacted items, computers, tablets, video games, major appliances. The feeling is from the buyers as this will likely extend into 2022.  Again, we're ordering as much as we can and getting in earlier. And I think as evidenced by most recent sales results, we're doing okay with this. Despite these issues -- sorry. In terms of transportation costs, they're increasing were reading about it every day. Containers, trucks, and drivers all are impacting the timing of deliveries and higher freight costs. Despite all these issues, we continue to work to mitigate cost increases in a variety of different ways and hold down and/or mitigate our price increases passed onto the members.  We've also chartered 3 ocean vessels for the next year to transport containers between Asia and the U.S. and Canada, and we've leased several thousand containers for use on these ships. Every ship can carry 800 to 1,000 containers at a time and we'll make approximately 10 deliveries during the course of the next year.  Moving to inflation, again, there have been many -- there have been and are a variety of inflationary pressures that we and others are seeing and -- more of it. As I discussed on last quarter's call, inflationary factors abound, higher labor costs, higher freight cost, higher transportation demand, along with container shortages and port delays, increased demand in certain product categories.  Various shortages of everything from computer chips to oils and chemicals, at higher commodities prices. That's a lot of fun right now. Some inflationary soundbites, if you will, price increases on items shipped across the oceans. Some suppliers are -- that's paying 2-6 times for containers and shipping. Price increases of pulp and paper goods, some items up 4% to 8%.  Again, we're trying to mitigate those where we can and we think we've done a decent job of mitigating some of it. Plastics, resin increases on things like dressed trash bags, Ziplock skews, pet products include -- resin oriented pet products, plastic cups, plates, plastic wrap, many items up in the 5% to 11% range. Metals, again aluminum foil, mid-single-digit crossed increases as well as cans for sodas and other beverages.  I mentioned commodities earlier, oil, coffee, nuts, they remain generally, according to our buyers at 5-year highs, and so on. Higher import prices on things from Europe, like cheeses, but the combination of freight and FX. 3% to 10% increases on certain but not all apparel items. And fresh foods inflation is up in the mid to high single-digits, with meat leading the way up high -- single to low double-digits due to the feed, labor, and transportation costs. Now, I was asked back in March at our Second Quarter Earnings Call at what level we felt inflation was running overall on the sale price side.  I stated that our best guess at the time was somewhere between 1% and 1.5%. I updated that 16 weeks earlier -- 16 weeks ago on our May 26 Third Quarter Call and we opted for the estimate to be in the 2.5% to 3.5% range. As of today, in talking with our senior merchants, we would estimate the overall price inflation of the products we're selling to be in the 3.5% to 4.5% range.  As I discussed earlier, this inflation was the driver of the $30 million LIFO charge that we took in the quarter. But all of this said, I feel -- I feel very good with the job that our merchants, our Traffic department and our operators have all been doing enable to -- in order to get the products that we need, pivot when and where necessary, and keep our warehouses full while keeping prices as low as we can for our members and continuing to show incredible value versus our competitors.  I think this is reflected in our strong reported sales and profits that we've achieved, despite challenges and our typical aggressive pricing. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results for the 5 weeks ending September, Sunday, October 3rd, on Wednesday, October 6th, after the market close. And with that, I will open it up for questions with Anne. Anne? Thank you. Well on the first question, of course, I can't say we don't provide guidance, but we've always talked about being a top-line company and that helps a lot of things. So, depending on what level of sales, we'll have to wait and see. We do have the dollar increases started in March, that will anniversary next February.  So, at the end of Q2, next year. But again, we've shown that even with what we view as holding the line as much as we can on pricing and being pretty aggressive there and taking that into account, we've shown that with strong sales, we can certainly improve the bottom line as well, so fingers crossed. Sure. Well, first of all, as it relates to all the anecdotal comments I made about supply chain and inflation, I think overall we feel that we're doing a heck of a job in that stuff. And I think some of the advantages we have is that we certainly have the financial ability to bring in things early or to order early and to mitigate whatever delay may have occurred.  We certainly have the space to keep some of this stuff, most particularly because of our Costco Logistics acquisition a year ago, two additional storage space if you will. Not that we're having an issue with that because it's turning pretty fast, and the fact that we're able to pivot, we are bringing in new items. We're bringing in items off-season for Christmas, not -- pre - COVID it was toys, and trim at home, and electronics. Today it's all those things, plus things for the house, from barbecue grills, even summer items. But anything you can get your hands on. And again, I think we've done a very good job of adding suppliers where we can, and also making sure we're coming up with new items and being creative and innovative, even on the food and sundries side.  So, I think from that standpoint, despite sometimes looking at each other, the merchants and the traffic people never need to say, boy, when this is going to end? The fact is, I think we're doing a very good job with that. So, from an inventory standpoint, for those of you who several of you do go and visit our locations on a random basis, they're full, they look good compared to some of the pictures we see from others sometimes.  And so, I feel from that standpoint, we have a good issue. With inflation, to the extent that there are permanent inflationary items, like freight costs, or even somewhat permanent for the next year, we can't hold on to all those, some of that has to be passed on and it is being passed on.  We're pragmatic about it, but we recognize that since things have been so successful and our sales have been strong, we can hold the line on some of those things and do a little better job, hopefully, do a better job than some of our competitors have, and be even that more extreme in the value. So, I think, all those things, so far, at least despite the challenges have worked in our favor a little bit. Well, first of all, let me finish, Simeon had one other question on wages, and let me just respond to that. Look, we're known for always being one of the best wage packages and benefits packages and take care of our employee's package out there in big retail and big boxes, and all forms of big retail.  And even if - we raised our lowest, our starting wage to that 16 and 16.50 of late, mind you, our average hourly wage in the U.S. is slightly north of 24, with a very healthy employee benefit plan. We will do whatever it takes to continue to that -- that model.  Who knows when and where, but we feel pretty good about where we are. And but as many of you on the call know, irrespective of what's going on with our Company in terms of strong sales or weak sales, we will do what's right by our employees. And Michael, I'm sorry, can I go back to your question? Okay. Well look, I think the anomaly over the last year-and-a-half has been that when a lot of big boxes or big retailers were enjoying comps pre-COVID in the -- I'll call it the two to 4% range of the two to 5% range, and we're enjoying 5, 6s, 7s, now we've been enjoying mid-teens or effectively low-to-mid teens over, and we've taken some market share from others.  We think that some of that will stick, and we hope it will stick, and we feel pretty good right now about what we've done and what we've accomplished. To the extent that we can generate greater than industry average comps. I think - and there - they don't have to be in the low-to-mid teens, they could still be in the mid-to-high singles that we could -- should continue to improve. But I guess I get back to the comment that has been reinforced internally from the beginning of time, we are a top-line Company and everything else will take care of itself. I think -- your first part of your question, I think tells part of the tale is there are so many moving parts. If you look at gasoline, which is an - it is 10%+ of our sales. It's a huge business that can have huge variations of gross margin.  Knock-on-wood, always profitable, but it's still quite a range of gross margin. And that's more reflective of what's going on with competition in the retail gasoline market. We feel that sometimes other large retailers of gasoline, are looking to make a little more, which gives us the ability to be quite profitable but still show even bigger savings.  So, there are lots of puts and takes. Certainly, from last year, you had roughly a 16-week period, where our Optical and our Hearing Aid Centers were outright closed. Travel went to literally having negative revenue because it was not having a new business and it was refunding previously booked business at the trough of COVID, and so there's that kind of anomalies.  Again, I get back to thinking that due to the unfortunate thing called COVID, some businesses have benefited in the sense that we were essential, in the sense that our [cavernous] (ph) places like we feel that people felt comfortable coming in to the extent that we are able merchandise-wise to have pivoted and maintain notwithstanding supply chain issues, maintain exciting full warehouses of merchandise. So, I think those are the things that help us. Yeah. It's hard to say. I wouldn't just say it's that much based on that. It really depends. And mind you, when you have -- again, we've enjoyed a number of years of effectively very little, if any, or no LIFO or eating into our previous LIFO credit 5 and 6 years ago. But what -- if there was consistent inflation going forward for the next 2, 3, 4 quarters, you're going to also see some price increases to those customers.  And I might say some, there's been some already, but in our view, there is less than we could've done. And that will continue and I think the more consistent inflation -- if inflation raise stayed at this level, and we don't know that, but if it did stay at this level even with a LIFO charge, in some ways, it will be offset by price increases. [Indiscernible]. I don't know the -- I haven't asked and I don't know the answer to that. It makes sense. Thanks. It's the quarter, it's basically if you take your cost -- silos of inventory and what was it at Q3 end and what is it now at Q4 end. What we've said over the years is that certainly, we look at our gross profit as a combination of a gross margin plus a membership fee. But we really don't look at it together in that way you that, \"Hey, if we do something with the membership fee, we could be more aggressive on pricing. \" I remember years ago somebody had asked when the economy had softened and our comps did weaken a little bit and we were coming up on that fifth anniversary - ish of a pending increase and somebody said, given the economy's weaker you and your sales have weakened a little bit, still a positive number, but weakened a little bit.  Would you still do it? And the response at the time was more likely we will do it because that's what we do. We could drive lower prices with it and drive more business. And so, we really do -- we look at the loyalty and certainly, the loyalty and renewal rates have been up. [Indiscernible] If obviously, we're still a way away from anniversarying the last 5th year or so, the 5th plus year anniversarying of the last increase. So, we're a little way from thinking about it. I think if the -- we've always been considered to have more cash and have a more conservative balance sheet. I think as the world is saying that they think that it should be going up more. I don't think we've thought about it going up more.  In fact, when we did the capital raise in April of '20 and related specifically to what if -- was the worst-case of COVID, once -- 6 months later, we saw that we didn't need it. We probably gave it back to our shareholders and then a little.  So, I think the other anomaly has been is we've been blessed with a very good fiscal year. The last year and a half in terms of net income and operating cash flow relative to our CAPEX, our regular dividend, and the special, let's say that kind of offset the capital -- the debt we did. So, at the end of the day, I don't see us changing our MO in that at this point. It's really all about the value proposition. Are -- if anything, I think from the outside, people would look at us relative to other retailers and say we've been more aggressive on holding prices than others, at least that's how we feel.  But we have to be pragmatic as these things are permanent consistent. You've got to raise the price; we can't be completely noble here. But we feel that if anything, that moat has probably widened a little bit for us and that's great, we like wider moats. That's our view. That's our buyer's view. But we're looking at, frankly, given how strong it's been, and in our DNA, we hate raising prices. We want to be the last to raise it and the first to lower it. Is in our DNA not even -- putting on shades on the side and not even looking, at others.  We're looking at how do we drive our own business and we know that being the most -- the best value out there and having great merchandise and all that other wonderful stuff is how you do it. And as we've seen such strength in our numbers, and then as we've encountered rising levels in inflation, where can we hold the price on some things? And that's what we do. It's an art form more than a science. But it seems to work for us. Well, the big answer is we hope so. The fact that we are opening more units in '21 than we did in '20 is a positive. The fact that there are several international units that tends to have higher growth rates. The fact that Auto Renew is kind of a freebie in the sense that more people getting -- signing up and putting your credit card on their application -- in their application or signing up for the -- more importantly, signing up for the Citi Visa card.  That helps you a little bit driving the Executive Member, getting more people today -- if every 100 people signing up today, I think a little over half, I don't have an exact number, sign up as an executive member.  I remember 6, 7 years ago, or 8 years ago, it was half that percentage. And these are rough numbers, so don't hold me to them. But at the end of the day, executive members, by its definition, have higher renewal rates. They shop more frequently; they buy more stuff. So, all of that stuff is -- that -- those are all good factors for us. I don't think we have. By the way, before the next question, somebody checked a number, but we have seen a recent increase in applications in the last couple of weeks. I think Chuck asked that. Okay? No, I think -- when you say member promotions what do you mean? Oh, marketing. We did -- we do a variety of things. Not a huge basis, but we tried some things in the last few years. We've done some things with Groupon and with, one other one -- Living Social.  We've done some things as you've mentioned, but those are not on -- there I'd say they're on a regular -- irregular basis and we try different things all the time, but I know -- I think that's really, frankly, independent of looking at the membership fee itself.  It's really about how do we drive memberships and what is the incremental cost? What is the true cost of acquiring a new member other than waiting for them to go online or walk into the warehouse to sign up themselves? And so, we're always trying some new things. Less than 20%. Less than 20% of our Asia shipping. I don't know that off the top of my head. What I -- and I don't have all the specific statistics in front of us. All the charts that we look at keep going in the right direction. The number of people that bought online, percentage of members, the hit rate when we do something on an e-mail to get people to do something online. What Bob has mentioned, thank you, Bob, is that when you are -- if you take a regular, loyal member and when they do start shopping online, they may shop a few times less in-store, but the aggregate of the two is greater than their historical.  Which makes up? By the way, the other thing there is that the online, while we're constantly putting on what I'll call greater frequently traffic building items velocity items. And like apparel and health and beauty aids and things like that. The fact that matter is more and more big and bulky items are bought online.  Years ago, if you wanted to buy a mattress or a refrigerator, you had to go buy it and pick it up and take it home. We didn't deliver. We didn't install it. That's of course changed in the last many years and we have an Appliance business in the U.S. that's well over a billion dollars and growing fast -- continue to grow fast, helped by Costco Logistics. So that changes the metric a little bit too. I don't know. I don't have in front of me any detail by region in that regard. What I do know is, like everything right now it's all over the board. We're talking -- I forget what cleaning supply it was, whether it was Clorox, or Lysol, or some type of antibacterial wipe or whatever it was.  But there had been -- a year ago there was a shortage of merchandise, now they've got plenty of merchandise, but there's 2 to 3-week delays on getting it delivered because there's a limit on short-term changes to trucking and delivery needs of the supplier. So, it really is all over the board. Yes. Yes. Yes. If you look to the chart, which went down, so it's that -- last summer or last spring it was negative, more refunds than new things being bought. It really got back to almost normal. I'm talking about, bookings of resort vacations and -- to Hawaii and to Mexico and things like that.  And just a month ago -- month-and-a-half, two months ago, at the monthly budget being the charts were showing us it's almost back to where it was pre-COVID. And then it fell like a rock, not as bad as it was at its drought last spring, but it's certainly calmed down. Cars were not hit as bad, but that will fluctuate based on, again, what's going on out there. Right. We're currently not doing it. We discontinued it, for now, we'll try some new things somewhere sometime, but at this point, we got a lot of good things going on and we really didn't see a lot of traction in it. I wouldn't say that. I think food -- fresh turns so fast, it turns more than 50 times a year or whatever. And we've got a hot price on strip steaks or keeping the rotisserie chicken and for $0.99, that's going to impact you a little faster. But the comment here is that we're not going to change the price of muffins every week. So, we'll take a little less margin on some items. I think it's all over the board. But at the end of the day, it's an art form, not a science, or not straight across, we're going to do this much on every item. Mostly. Pharmacy and Optical have. Food courts have come back, Hearing Aids not quite yet, but much better than it was at its trough -- And Travel is lots of fun based on what's going on with COVID. No, it will have a three in front of it. First of all, as it relates to pricing and elasticity, I think if we were considered the best Company in the world with data analytics, we would still not use it for price elasticity. We're going to do what we do as merchants and look at competitive prices, and see how low we can mark something up.  And the old saying from years ago, we want to improve margins and lower prices at the same time by buying better and doing those things. So, I don't see that happening at all. As it relates to the other aspect of that, that's coming. We made a big investment in what I'll call data analytics for us because we went from darn near 0 to something.  But brought on a VP of data analytics a year ago in March. There's been a lot of progress, a lot of focus to date has been on the merchandising side, providing better tools to buy and to project, and things like that. I think you'll see more of that over the next year, but again, we're getting there.  I always look at it as just some of the things that others are doing that will help. It's low-hanging fruit for us because we haven't done it yet, but we'll keep going. But that's where a lot of the data analytic function to date in this past year as we built a department around it, has been just that. I think there's a little bit of both. There is a little bit of taking it where you can get it right now, and certainly, we're consciously bringing in. I think I mentioned even what was the furniture where the cycle has gone from 12 and 14 weeks to 16 and 18, we're bringing in early. And certainly, on seasonal things, we'll do that on some items. But it's a mixed bag just because we're pivoting and blocking and tackling in 12 different directions like everybody. We have time for one last question. It's both. I am sorry, what? Margins have generally stayed the same, I mean, we gave you some examples on the side of the fresh food, where it's changed and why, but generally speaking, I think there is, again, a lot of moving parts and we continue to figure out how to balance it. Well, I mean, I'm not on a specific product example, but the fact is, one we've got strong relationships and good buying power with our vendors. When we're eating a little bit into something, we're asking in some cases for them to eat a little bit into it. During these times, we're constantly figuring out how to be where they're any cost savings to offset some of the cost increases.  Whether it's packaging or whatever it might be. And so, I mean, I think one of the things that help us is that we're worried about managing 3,800 items, not 100,000 items or 50,000 items, and that's helped us. Yeah, there are times where we'll be pivoting in and out of items for that reason also. Sorry to be vague but it really is, there are just so many different things out there. Well, thank you, everyone will be around for any additional questions, and have a good week and talk to you next time."

Last year's third quarter included $283 million pre-tax, or $0.47 per share of COVID-19-related costs.  Net sales for the quarter increased year-over-year in the quarter by 21.7% from $44.38 billion -- to $44.38 billion this year from $36.45 billion a year ago. Comparable sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 were as follows: in the U.S., on a reported basis, sales were - comparable sales were up 18%, ex gas inflation, up 15.2%; Canada, on a reported basis, up 32.3%, ex both gas and strong Canadian dollar, ex gas and FX, up 16.7%; other international reported plus 22.9%, ex gas and FX, plus 13.1%. All told, company reported comp sales of 20.6% and, again, ex gas and FX, 15.1% up; e-commerce, on a reported basis, was 41.2%, ex FX was up 38.2%, and that's on top of a year ago in the third quarter when it was up 66.1% in Q3 a year ago versus the prior year to that.  In terms of Q3 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 12.5% worldwide and plus 11.9% in the U.S. Our average transaction or ticket was up 7.3% worldwide and up 5.7% U.S. during the third quarter. And these numbers include the positive impact both of gas inflation and FX. So adjusting for that, they would be in the 1.8% and 2.7% in the U.S. adjusted for those.  Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted sales by approximately 290 basis points. And gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 260 basis points.  Going down the income statement. Membership fee income reported for the third quarter, $901 million or 2.03% of sales. Again, we had strong FX, and so adjusting for that out, the $86 million reported increase would have been up $67 million, so FX up 8.2%, on a reported basis, up 10.6%.  In terms of renewal rates, the U.S. and Canadian rate of -- came in at 91.0%, the same as it was at Q2 end. Worldwide, our total company renewal rate was 88.4% at Q3 end or 0.1% lower during the prior quarter-end. China entered the renewal calculation for the first time this fiscal quarter. First year renewal rates generally lag those of later years. And excluding China, the worldwide rate would have actually improved 0.1% versus the prior quarter.  In terms of number of members at Q3 end, both member households and total cardholders. At the end of third quarter, total paid households 60.6 million, up from 59.7 million 12 weeks earlier. Total cardholders, 109.8 million, up from 108.3 million at the end of the second quarter 12 weeks ago. At Q3 end, paid executive membership totaled 24.6 million members, an increase of 817,000 during the 12 weeks since Q2 end.  Moving down the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin in the third quarter was lower year-over-year by 35 basis points, coming in at 11.18% compared to a year ago at 11.53%.  As I usually do, I ask you to jot down a few numbers, two columns: both the reported year-over-year change in gross margin; and the second column, ex gas inflation. Merchandise core, reported minus 52 basis points year-over-year and ex gas inflation, minus 29 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses reported plus 2 basis points and ex gas inflation plus 7 basis points. 2% Reward, plus 1 basis point and minus 2 basis points. Other, plus 14 basis points in both columns. Total, therefore, reported gross margin, again, year-over-year was reported down 35 basis points and ex gas inflation down 10 basis points.  The core merchandise component, as you show here, was -- as I mentioned here, was down 52 basis points year-over-year on -- and down 29% on ex gas inflation. This is primarily a function of sales shifting from core to ancillary versus last year as we begin to revert back to more historical sales penetrations. Recall, last year, we saw a significant shift of sales out of ancillary and other businesses and into the core.  In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in third quarter, the core and core margin were better by plus 27 basis points, with nonfoods up significantly, rebounding from last year's lows. Food and sundries flat year-over-year and fresh foods down from last year, the latter still strong by historical standards.  Fresh, as we've mentioned over the last few quarters, is lapping exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outsized sales that began a year ago in Q3 with the onset of COVID. Ancillary and other business gross margins, again, ex gas inflation was up 7 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. We have a lot going on here as of last year we \u2013 as last year, we had closed the hearing aid and optical departments and had severely limited the service and selection at our food courts for most of Q3 last year.  Gas had a particularly good quarter a year ago, which had helped to offset some of those closures a year ago. This year, we're showing margin improvement in optical, food court, e-com and hearing aids, somewhat offset by gas.  The 2% Reward was, again, on excluding gas inflation, was lower by 2 basis points, indicating higher sales penetration to our executive members and the rewards associated with it. And other is plus 14 basis points. 9 of the 14 basis points is attributable to lower COVID-19 costs year-over-year. $44 million hit to margin in Q3 a year ago versus a $14 million hit to margin this year in the third quarter. Last year, we incurred 10 weeks of the incremental $2 an hour premium wage. This -- that portion you see here relates to the labor associated with our fulfillment manufacturing businesses. This year, we incurred two weeks of the incremental two-hour -- the incremental $2 an hour premium wage as the program was discontinued at the end of the second week of Q3 after 52 weeks in place.  The other plus 5 basis points or $19.7 million came from accruing a reserve last year in Q3 for certain third-party gift cards and ticket programs that were adversely impacted by the onset of COVID. One other comment, as I discussed during our March 4 Q2 earnings conference call. In conjunction with the discontinuing of the $2 an hour premium pay, we implemented a permanent wage increase for our hourly employees as well as most of our salaried manager employees, which took effect in week three of this fiscal quarter. Since it's a permanent wage increase going forward, its impact is simply in our reported numbers and not separated out as COVID-related. Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the third quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 107 basis points. Again to jot down these following 2 columns and numbers, first column is reported, and second column, excluding gas inflation. In terms of operations, year-over-year, plus 37 basis points, meaning lower or better by 37 basis points, ex gas inflation, plus 20 basis points. Central plus 4 basis points and plus 1 basis point; stock compensation, plus 5 and plus 4; other, plus 61 and plus 61. For a total, on a reported basis, again, SG&A year-over-year was lower or better by 107 basis points on a reported basis and excluding gas inflation, better by -- or lower by 86 basis points.  Again, looking here, the core operation was better by 37 and plus -- better by 20, excluding the impact of gas inflation. A good result, particularly given that we implemented a permanent $1 an hour wage increase for the last 10 of the 12 weeks that comprise Q3. Central, nothing surprising there. Same with stock comp, and other, the plus 61 basis points ex gas inflation, 56 of the 61 was attributable to the lower cost from COVID. $239 million hits SG&A in Q3 a year ago compared to $44 million in Q3 this year. The balance or plus 5 basis points, lower by 5 basis points, was $18.5 million were cost associated with the acquisition and integration of Innovel a year ago.  Next on the income statement is preopening expense. Basically, this year, it was -- it came in at $10 million, $2 million higher than the $8 million in Q3 of fiscal '20. Nothing out of the ordinary with the preopening this quarter.  All told, reported operating income in Q3 '21 increased 41%, coming in at $1.663 billion this year compared to $1.179 billion a year ago in the quarter.  Below the operating income line, interest expense was $40 million this year versus $37 million a year ago. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $6 million or better by $6 million. Interest income was actually lower by $2 million year-over-year due to lower interest rates. Additionally, FX and other was higher by $8 million year-over-year.  Overall, reported pretax income in the third quarter was up -- reported pretax income was up 42%, coming in at $1.650 billion this year compared to $1.163 billion a year ago. In terms of e-commerce, our e-commerce sales, as I mentioned earlier -- I'm sorry, before I go to e-commerce, our tax rate in the third quarter came in at 25.2% compared to 26.7% a year earlier. This quarter benefited from onetime discrete tax item that benefited our number.  For all of '21, based on our estimates, which, of course, are, sadly, subject to change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total company tax rate for the year to be in the 26% to 27% range. A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, in Q3, we opened 6 new warehouses, 1 in the U.S.; 3 in Canada; and 2 internationally. We also have plans in Q4 to open 7 additional ones, 5 in the U.S. and 2 others internationally. And that would put us in a total of 21 net new warehouses for the fiscal year, 23 -- which included 2 relocations, so 21 net.  In addition to the 21 planned openings for fiscal '21, we are looking to open about 25 new units, net new units in each of the next 2 fiscal years, including a second warehouse in China in fiscal '22, which would be the end of -- towards the end of calendar '21 and a third expected to open in late calendar '22, which would be early fiscal year '23.  Regarding CapEx, the third quarter fiscal '21 spend was approximately $1.03 billion. Our full year CapEx spend is now estimated to be in the $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion range, increased a little from our estimate made 12 weeks earlier to include the recent $340 million purchase of a distribution facility on the West Coast to support our big and bulky delivery activities.  Now going -- turning to e-commerce. Again, e-commerce sales in the third quarter ex FX increased 38.2% year-over-year. Stronger departments included jewelry, home furnishings, sporting goods, hardware and majors, which, of course, includes both everything from appliances to consumer electronics.  In terms of Costco Logistics and an update there, we anniversary-ed the purchase of Innovel, now called Costco Logistics this fiscal quarter. Costco Logistics continues to drive big and bulky sales with the U.S. e-com sales on these items up 53% during the quarter.  Costco Logistics fulfilled about 70% of all U.S. big and bulky orders, and we also continue to add some new big and bulky vendors. Overall, we've improved delivery time on many items from up to 2 weeks to in many -- in several cases, now 5 to 7 days. As well, we've taken several items that were previously vendor-drop shipped that are now -- and are now being direct imported allowing us to not only speed up delivery but reduce prices to our members.  From a supply chain perspective, port delays are continuing to have an impact. We are utilizing additional carriers, in some cases, to help alleviate some of that. Containers and pallets are also facing shortages anecdotally, 35% to 50% increase in incoming containers this year versus a year ago. Some of that's pent-up demand, but just from the low points a year ago. The turnaround of a container hitting the U.S., delivering its contents and being back at the U.S. port to head back overseas has gone from approximately 25 days to 50 days. So a combination of things in terms of delays.  Chips shortages are impacting many items from an inflation standpoint, some items more than others. And again, as I mentioned, with regard to containers and shipping, transportation costs have increased as well. Despite these issues, we continue to work to mitigate cost increases and supply chain delays in a variety of different ways as best we can. The biggest way we've handled supply chain delays is adjusted ordering and front-loading, if you will, orders of many items. And we think we've got that pretty well under control.  This will continue -- the feeling is that this will continue for the most part of this calendar year. We've had a lot of questions about inflation over the past few months. There have been and are a variety of inflationary pressures that we and others are seeing. Inflationary factors abound. These include higher labor costs, higher freight costs, higher transportation demand, along with the container shortage and port delays that I mentioned, increased demand in various product categories some shortages, various shortages of everything from chips to oils and chemical supplies by facilities hit by the Gulf freeze and storms and, in some cases, higher commodity prices.  Some inflationary sound bites, if you will. Price increases on items shipped across the ocean with suppliers paying up to double for containers and shipping. Price increases of pulp, paper goods, some things up 4% to 8%, plastic and resin increases from trash bags to plastic cups, plates, et cetera, and plastic wraps. Metals, aluminum foil, mid-single-digit cost increases also cans for sodas and other beverages. Higher import prices on cheeses, the combination of the product itself as well as some FX strength of some foreign currencies as well as freight, anywhere from 3% to 10% increases on certain apparel items, not all.  In terms of fresh, higher protein prices, for example, meat overall year-over-year is up 7%. Beef in the last month has been up as much as 20%. Some of that is due to feed labor and transportation costs as well as restocking some of the additional increased demand coming now from institutional needs as restaurants start to reopen. And the list could go on and on.  Now all this being said, I was asked back on our March 4 -- second quarter call. At what level we felt inflation was running overall at that time with our goods. I stated that our best guess was somewhere in the 1% to 1.5% range. As of today, we guess that overall price inflation at the selling level, and excluding our gasoline sales, would be estimated to be probably more in the 2.5% to 3.5% range.  Some items are up more and some items, the sale prices haven't yet changed. And some items are even down a little bit. We think, again, we've done pretty well in terms of controlling that as best as we can, but the inflation pressures abound.  In terms of sampling and demos in the warehouse, as you all know, we eliminated our popular food sampling and demo activities in our warehouses last March at the onset of the pandemic. As various states opened and closed last summer and fall, we tried a few sampling events. A few single-serve items like cookies and crackers, take-out only, no cook to prepared sample items and a few enhanced talking demos such as items for display only.  I'm happy to report that over the next couple of weeks, we're beginning a phased return to full sampling. This will come in waves. The first wave of locations, about 170 of our 550-ish locations in the U.S. will be activated by the first week of June, with most of the remaining locations returning towards the near -- or towards the end of June. The first wave will actually determine how fast we roll out and what and when restrictions are lifted. I'm sure there will be a few states with unique restrictions as well.  Increased safety protocols are and will be in place, including all samples prepared behind plexiglass, prepared in smaller batches for better safety control and distribute it to members one at a time.  Food courts, same thing as well. I'm pleased to report that our food courts are also coming back over the next few weeks in a bigger way. Last March, again in 2020 as the pandemic took hold, we pared back menu basically to hotdogs and pizza and soda and smoothies, and we eliminated all seating, those takeout only. We began several weeks ago adding back tables and seating and -- at a handful of outdoor food courts in a few states.  Over the past few months, we've also added back a few more food items, including bringing back a new and improved churros, which will be at all U.S. locations by the 4th of July, and adding a high-end soft ice cream to replace our frozen yogurt.  And by June 7, we plan to have tables in seating back at most locations, but with more physical separation, tables of 4 instead of 6 and 8 and about half the seating capacity as we had before. Again, these are still subject to doing this in waves and see how it goes and subject to any additional state rules or restrictions in a few cases.  Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results. For the 4 weeks ending the Sunday, May 30, on next Thursday, June 4 after market closes. With that, I will open up to questions and answers, and I'll turn it back over to Sarah. Sarah?\nOperator: Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is open.\nMichael Lasser: Good afternoon. Richard, you outlined a variety of inflationary pressures that you're seeing in the business. How is this going to impact Costco's gross margin over the next couple of quarters? Costco tends to move more slowly with changing prices than others. Should we expect this to be a pressure point, especially as you lap a period of strong gross margin gain given the good sell-through last year?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I mean, we'll have -- of course, Michael, we'll have to wait and see. I mean, our view is, is that while historically, we want to be -- mitigate those increases and work with our vendors and try to be as efficient as possible to lower those pressure points, some of it will pass through, and some of it has passed through. From a competitive standpoint, our view is it has not really impacted our margins in any big way. Some of the inflationary pressures, some very simple examples might be things like our $4.99 rotisserie chicken and our $2.99 40-packet of water. Those have stayed the same, notwithstanding there's been some pressure on some cost components of these items. So those are already impacting our margins a little. And I don't -- I think overall, relative to competition, that's not going to be an impact -- a big impact of where we go margin-wise.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. My follow-up question is on the value of the Costco membership. Amazon is enhancing the value of its membership with more media content. Walmart continues to focus on the value of its membership offering. Do you think these factors are influencing the pricing power that Costco has to raise the fees associated with either the gold or executive membership? And do you feel like there has been a sharp increase in the value of a Costco membership over the last four years is that as you approach the normal cadence of when you would typically raise your fees, you could do it this time again?\nRichard Galanti: Sure. Well, look, we focus first on driving more value. And I would like to think that some of the benefits that we've had in terms of strong business over the last -- not only the last year with COVID, certainly, we've been helped by the fact that we've been deemed an essential business and the strength in fresh and food items has helped quite a bit as well and buying things for the home. But I think we've gained market share on top of that, and that's all about value. I mean, our model is -- our view is our model is intact as it relates to the best prices on the best quality goods and services. And certainly, our buying power keeps improving in that regard. We've added things as it relates to different forms of procuring the merchandise, whether it's in-store or a big increase like many people with e-commerce. Certainly, our acquisition of what's now called Costco Logistics has been a big boom for our -- we believe, for our sales strength and competitiveness in those areas. So we think from a value proposition standpoint, the value of what we offer our members keeps going up.  As it relates to fee increases, historically, we've done it about every five years, so we would expect now to start getting questions since this is a year before that, and our answer is pretty straightforward. We'll have to wait and see. But we certainly feel good about our competitive position.\nMichael Lasser: All right. Thank you so much and best of luck.\nRichard Galanti: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimeon Gutman: Hey, Richard, the core on core, I think, you said up 27. And I know you don't guide on this. I just want to ask maybe about the puts and the takes, if you talk about other categories that are higher margin that have yet to recover on the positive side. And then on the other side, the spoilage and some other things that helped you last year sort of come back. So just kind of think are there more good guys, the bad guy and just another way to think about the gross margin core on core going forward?\nRichard Galanti: Sure. Well, there's always different pieces to that equation. As I mentioned, one of the things that we mentioned over the last few quarters was particularly strong fresh foods margins with higher labor productivity and much lower products spoilage. While, again, we're still above where we were pre-COVID, it's come down a little from its peak a year ago in Q3, but still nonetheless better than historical numbers.  One of the things that I mentioned picked up was nonfood. Again, the strength that we've seen in nonfoods has continued. It really started in the summer when people buying things for their home. Outside of that, certainly, I would expect on an ancillary business, taking gas out of it for a minute because that goes up and down at -- with a lot of factors causing it who the heck knows. But at the end of the day, if you look at some of the other ancillary businesses, I would expect to see, of course, margin improvement with optical and hearing aid relative to a year ago, for sure, even in Q4.  Same thing with travel. Travel is coming back as we see on the news every night. Travel is coming back in a big way with the improvement with COVID as well as probably a lot of pent-up demand. And we're seeing that ourselves in our travel business. And that's a high-margin business, although a small piece of the total sales action for the company.  So I think, overall, we seem to figure out how to get there in different ways, even something like Costco Logistics that in the last three-or-so quarters, I pointed out, it was a 5 to 7 basis point hit to margin. It's finally -- anniversary-ed some of that, and hopefully, we'll start to show some improvement. But there's little things like that that might show you a little improvement in the future.  So -- but overall, it gets back to our ability to price our goods to - for great value and being competitive and still hopefully improving the bottom line will continue. But we'll let you know each quarter.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Sorry about the noise, but one quick question on inflation. It sounds like maybe other retailers are raising prices, but you're just -- your prices are up and not letting them lag. So I guess you're seeing the demand staying healthy. Or are you seeing the environment just stay rationale all across the board, and that's allowing you to take pricing up sort of at the same time as the input costs go up?\nRichard Galanti: Well, look, I think, first of all, we look at what we can do with our own blinders on. There has been a lot of CPG companies, both in paper goods, soda pop that have announced increases. And many of them are sticking because we and other retailers are aware of the underlying costs associated with it. I think we -- I'd like to think we can do as good a job as any given our purchasing power and limited number of SKUs that can mitigate that as best we can. To the extent that those are happening, the fact that, on average, our competitors are taking those probably as fast as not a little faster than us is a positive. But we've taken some price increases on things that have gone up.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Thanks, Richard.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citigroup. Your line is open.\nTracy Kogan: Hey, it's Tracy Kogan filling in for Paul. I have a question about your customer -- the customers that you've gained over the past year during the pandemic. And I was wondering if you could talk about maybe the demographics of that customer and what the repeat purchases have looked like, and how their spending might differ from your core group of customers? Thanks.\nRichard Galanti: Right. What's -- I guess, most interesting is, other than from an age standpoint, being a demographic that's so -- the next young generation of Gen Z or millennials before that and Gen Y or whatever else, we're getting our share of them. We did see over the -- as COVID hit, there was, of course, a spike not only -- there was a big spike, a big increase with same-day fresh delivery in many -- in most cases, with us with our relationship with Instacart. And also doing ourselves two-day dry grocery and some other items. And again, anecdotally, we know that we garnered some additional members that way. On the 2-day, since that is done via mostly UPS, you may have -- we've gotten some members that are outside of our geographic market areas of physical warehouses, but not a big giant number. So overall, I think if anything, we've seen our continued strength of adding net new members to existing warehouses.  Certainly, opening new warehouses helps and perhaps getting a few related to the online next-day delivery of fresh and things like that. Beyond that, again, when we see who from -- again, from an age demographic, we're getting -- we think that we're getting our good share of younger people as we did in previous. That was -- historically, that was sometimes a concern of some on Wall Street. Is this for the older generation? And what we're finding is as long as we keep changing our product mix to gear towards our -- who the member is, and in our case, when you see what we've done with organics over the last 10 years or more now, and summer sporting equipment and you name it, we get our fair share of those people.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett.\nCharles Grom: Richard, inventory dollars were up about 27%, which is much higher than you guys currently run. Just curious if there's any pull forward of items. And I guess, how do you feel about the current -- the position right now?\nRichard Galanti: I think what's interesting is -- yes, it was a little lower last year because we were just being hit with it. And so while we were scurrying to get merchandise in, we would also -- if you recall, back in March and early April, as we were realizing like everybody else that this was going to last longer, we were starting to cut back where we could seasonal orders and might have reduced our patio furniture needs for the part of the summer season and some of our Halloween needs and Christmas needs.  And then we found out that we needed it even more. So probably some of it has to do with the fact that it being a little lower. And then as what I talked to earlier in this call about front-loading and buying early, that's -- we are happy to have some extra inventory. We clearly have a lot of -- we have plenty of cash to do that. And certainly, the cost of buying forward a little bit on some of these things is de minimis relative to what we earn on our cash.\nCharles Grom: Okay. Great. That makes sense. And then just on the consumer. Curious what you're seeing over the past few weeks or maybe the past couple of months from a behavior perspective, both frequency in your clubs, basket sizes, particularly in states that are further along in the reopening process.\nRichard Galanti: Well, again, it's hard to figure all these out because so many things were happening particularly last year in April, May, June time frame. What we saw is the states that opened a little early, we started seeing a little bit more shopping frequency a little earlier like Texas and Florida, but not in a meaningful discernible way. Trend-wise, yes, but not like let's wait for that everywhere.  But even in states that have been a little bit more closed, I mean the U.S., in particular, has opened up quite a bit in the last 1 month, 1.5 months as evidenced by new CDC guidelines and I think the spring weather in general, and so -- and just the pent-up interest in doing that. So I think a lot of that's already in there.  And in other countries, in Canada, there's still some -- for much of the last fiscal quarter, in about 38 of the 101 or 102 Costcos in Canada, one of the main provinces, there was limitations on -- we had to cordon off nonessential items or so nonfood items. We can only sell food and cleaning supplies and paper goods and health and beauty and the like. So -- but that's -- even that is, I think, in a big way pretty much over.\nCharles Grom: Okay. Great. And then just last one for me. COVID costs were down meaningfully here in the third quarter. I'd imagine relative to the $281 million that you booked in the fourth quarter last year, you'd expect them to come down a lot. Is that a fair assumption for 4Q?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Yes, again, a big chunk of that is the $2 an hour premium, which has been eliminated. And again, mind you that there'll still be a chunk related to the $1 permanent -- mostly $1 permanent wage increase that we did.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays.\nKaren Short: Actually, just following up on that last question. So looking at your sales growth versus your SG&A growth and recognizing that within SG&A dollars, you did still have the $2 for part of the quarter, I mean, it's been -- it's a much wider gap than we've seen for a long time, like even kind of looking at pre-COVID. So I'm wondering if there's anything you could point to on that specifically, and how to think about that going forward. And then I had one other question.\nRichard Galanti: Sure. I think first and foremost, it's sales, strong sales. This is a business that we know the benefits -- the operating leverage we got when we could do a 7% comp instead of a 4 or 5, and enjoying the comps that we have now, that's the biggest single piece of it. If anything, in the quarter, health care cost probably a little higher because people weren't going for their regular doctor visits a year ago in the third quarter. And so that was probably a little bit of a hit. But more -- what offsets all those types of anecdotal things is strong sales and just a core labor costs.\nKaren Short: Okay. And then...\nRichard Galanti: Gas as well, taking gas inflation out of there would reduce that a little bit.\nKaren Short: Right. Okay. And then my second question or actually maybe 2 more, with respect to the membership fee, obviously, recognizing the value of membership fee to your members, how are you thinking about timeline on the next possible increase just because I think we did anniversary what would be the 5-year mark?\nRichard Galanti: No. Actually, the 5-year mark is next June.\nKaren Short: Okay. And so what's -- how are you thinking about that philosophically?\nRichard Galanti: Philosophically, I get to think about not thinking about it for several months. No, jokes aside, again, we feel good about our member loyalty. Needless to say, with our renewal rates, we feel very good about our competitive position. But there's -- we really haven't given a lot of thought yet.\nKaren Short: Okay. And then just my last question. In terms of e-com, obviously, you gave us a good percent of sales and the growth that doesn't include third party. Can you actually give us a number -- and can you just give us an update on where that stands when you include the third-party in food?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. I think it's -- my guess is it's probably not as impactful now. The third party, most particularly the same-day fresh delivery really peaked last, I want to say, May or April, late April. And where -- it was huge and, I mean, it was tenfold increase. And it's now probably halved, still huge relative to pre-pandemic. But -- so it's not as impactful as it was. So again, I think there are a couple of quarters where we had -- a couple of quarters ago, we had like an 86% comp in e-commerce.  And we said that if you added back the stuff that we don't put in there like same-day fresh since third parties come in and buy it in the warehouse and take it to you, that 86% -- that 85% or 86% was up towards 100%. If you just -- this is -- I'm shooting from the hip here, but if that was 15 percentage points, let's assume it's 5 to 8 percentage points, but certainly not 15.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim.\nJohn Heinbockel: Richard, let me start, Costco Logistics, where are you guys now with capacity utilization? And where will you be when you add this new facility? And to the degree that costs are coming down, have you yet invested in price? Or are you investing more in delivery timetable, quickness of delivery?\nRichard Galanti: Well, we were proving -- not to say that we don't have a few complaints every day from someone that screwed something up. But at the end of the day, we're improving in a big way. We actually were aggressive on pricing immediately. It's kind of like when we went into a new country like France or Spain, we're pricing in low volume, less efficient departments like fresh as if we were doing a lot of volume. And so those are examples where it's hurting us to start with as it relates to -- we're going to price the goods or lower the price of a mattress or a furniture set delivery based on what we can do before we actually do it.  Now that's thankfully catching up for itself -- with itself. In terms of capacity, it has a lot of capacity. As I mentioned, right now, about 70% of our big and bulky is now delivered through Costco Logistics. Some of it was being delivered by third parties that we're doing fine, but now we're doing it ourselves. That business, as I mentioned, is continuing to grow very handily not only for us but industry-wide with furniture and things for the home, exercise equipment, TVs and the like. And we think that we have tremendous capacity available. What we bought was at a capacity of less than 50% of what it had been doing itself a few years before. But again, those aren't completely -- you can't completely compare those two.  What we just bought was a huge facility and acreage that allow us to do more big and bulky and recognizing so many things come in from overseas in big and bulky, and it's again on the West Coast in California. And so it's going to help us continue to grow that business.  We think we have a lot of growth. Way before COVID and more big and bulky and everything else, recall in the U.S., what we saw over the last 5 years, I think it was 5 years ago, we said in just white goods when all we did was sell them in store, we did about $50 million. And the year pre-COVID, 3 years hence, we did about $750 million or something. We're well beyond that now, both natural growth as well as what COVID has done in terms of people buying things for the home and then us being able to become more competitive on pricing.  We've seen items, not across the board, but items where we've lowered the price by 10% and 15% or more, greatly improved the delivery time and are driving that business.\nJohn Heinbockel: And then just real quick, lastly, the cold and frozen delivery program, the 2-day program, how is that being fulfilled? And how do you think about that conceptually, right, in terms of consumer uptake versus the dry grocery that you did previously?\nRichard Galanti: It's really too early, John, to tell. We just started that 3 weeks ago, and something that our people in that operation wanted to try. And business centers, it's -- we think it's something that lends itself well to our business customer needs as well, and we'll see.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from R5 Capital.\nScott Mushkin: So Richard, I actually wanted to get back at this big and bulky that we were talking about before. Kind of hoping you can maybe size the opportunity. Obviously, you guys are putting a lot of money into it. What kind of -- maybe you can give us like what percentage of your sales are in those items now, where do you think it's going to go. Like how much do you think you can drive sales? I was just wondering if you could do anything to size it because it's obviously a big focus for the company and a big capital investment.\nRichard Galanti: Yes. I don't have that detail in front of me. We're seeing 30% and 50% increases on items within some of those categories, everything from outdoor patio furniture or indoor furniture to mattresses to exercise equipment, the TVs along the way.\nScott Mushkin: And is your expectation to bring in more vendors? And I don't know how many SKUs you're offering, but will you have more SKUs? And how are you thinking about advertising at your membership base?\nRichard Galanti: Well, yes, I mean, first of all, I think that when we look at our 3- to 5-year plan, we think there will be outsized growth certainly for the next 3-plus years, we'll see. In terms of adding SKUs, yes, but we're not going crazy. Certainly, there's more SKUs online furniture sets, sofa and chair sets. We might have 1 or 2 on display, sometimes, in a warehouse, we'll have a dozen or so online. So we are adding both vendor names as well as additional selection, but still greatly limited relative to the traditional retail of those items.\nScott Mushkin: Perfect. And then my second question is something we've talked about all the time, and I could go at it again. It's just on the openings. I know you said 25 this year over '22 and 25 in '23, I guess. I mean obviously, our research suggests you guys could do a lot more. And I know we've talked about the, I guess, the hard thing of getting the right locations and everything else. But what would it take to get that to 30 to 35, again on a more permanent basis? And is that something you guys would kind of strive to do? Because clearly the market opportunity is there.\nOperator: This is the operator. I'm sorry. The line of the speaker got disconnected for a second. [Technical Difficulty]. \nRichard Galanti: Sorry about that. Scott, let's go back to your question. My apologies.\nScott Mushkin: That's all right. So my question was, I don't know what -- did you guys hear any of my question or no?\nRichard Galanti: You can start again.\nScott Mushkin: Okay. So basically, you said fiscal '22 and '23, 25 clubs and 25 clubs, we've talked about this a number of times about trying to get that number up. Obviously, the market opportunity is there. Can you beef up the real estate department? Like what's the -- what's holding you guys back to getting to 30 to 35? Again, because it looks like the opportunity is there to us with the research.\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think some other countries tend to be a little slower and challenged, but we have beefed it up. That's one of the reasons I think that I went out as far as I did by saying 25 in each of the next 2 years. We feel relatively confident that the -- all the items that we have in the fire right now, both U.S. and Canada as well as other parts of the world, we feel good about. We've got a lot of things going on.  Now going from 25 to 35, I'm not sure we're prepared to do that yet. Could we do it? Yes. But certainly, in some of the countries that are smaller, we like to go slow. And I mean, we picked up the pace in China by now having 2 ready either under construction or getting ready to be under construction and to open over the next 18 months. And for us, that's faster than we would have gone. And you'll see more announcements both there and elsewhere over the next few quarters.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer.\nErica Eiler: This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. So first, I wanted to touch on your services business. As we look at travel and optical and food court, is there any way you can help us frame, at this point, how much of your service businesses have recovered versus 2019 levels?\nRichard Galanti: Well, there's a few different things. I mean if I look at travel, I think, in the last month, we probably had 10 of our top 15 days ever in our history, so even at holiday time in '19. Part of that, again, though, was the pent-up demand. So we'll see where it normalizes out. Right now, both car rentals, we also pivoted and added in addition to -- while cruises are still down, they're being booked again now, but still down.  We did a big push starting several months ago to negotiate and offer some great deals on other, what I'll call, U.S., Mexico and Hawaii-type trips -- vacation trips.  Yes. So bookings, they're not revenue yet, but bookings are particularly strong now. And hearing aid, you had a little bit of the same issue when they were essentially closed down because of direct one-to-one contact, when you're getting fitted for a hearing aid. There was a lot of pent-up demand that we've seen and we continue to see, the same with optical. We think that will continue to be normalized, but we'll have to wait and see.  Food courts is probably going to take another several months. Having tables out there will help, expanding the menu will help. And of course, pharmacy didn't really ever see a big dramatic downturn.\nErica Eiler: Okay. Great. And then your food categories have held up really well in spite of lapping the difficult comparisons last year. So maybe just an update on how you're thinking about food-at-home consumption from here.\nRichard Galanti: Well, I mean, our 40,000-foot view of that is that what was gained because of food away from home stopping a year ago, and while it picked up some with takeout and delivery, it's now starting to improve a little bit, but some of that's going to be sticky. I don't know what the exact number is going to be, but our view is, is that it still certainly hasn't reverted back.  I mean restaurants are just beginning to open in a bigger way. In many cases, still people are reluctant to go in. In many cases, the tables are further separated. So some of that's going to continue for the next 6-plus months, is my guess. Beyond that, when all is said and done, will some of it still be sticky? Our view is probably the fact that we, as a company, have done a pretty good job of staying in stock and certainly the quality of our fresh foods, I think that we've not only benefited from that. I'd like to think that we gain market share from other traditional food retailers in that regard, particularly on the fresh side.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital Markets.\nKelly Bania: Richard, first, just wanted to ask about executive membership, the penetration, I guess, up over $800,000 this quarter. This is high as I can see it in our model here. Just was curious if that's still happening in a meaningful way in the U.S.? Or if there's any other countries? And just any color you can provide on that point.\nRichard Galanti: I think the one factor that was a little a bit of an anomaly is as we -- just in the last year, we expanded executive membership to Japan where we have 29 locations, 28 locations -- 29 locations, and including 2 new Japan locations this quarter. And as a company, I think, overall, we continue to get better at signing people up as executive members, telling them what the virtue of it is and doing a better job of having a higher percentage of every 100 new members that sign up as well as converting.  I think within that 817,000 something just under 200,000 was Japan. So even taking that out, I think it was 180-something thousand. So even taking that out, the 6 30 or 40 pluses, it was still a very strong number for the quarter outside of that.\nKelly Bania: Okay. That's helpful. And then just any update on the pickup test that's happening?\nRichard Galanti: It's still a test. We're still just doing it in New Mexico in 3 locations. And the utilization of it, when we first did it, we marketed a little bit. The utilization has not set the world on fire in terms of where it's trending.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine from Loop Capital.\nLaura Champine: So Richard, you mentioned the negative impact on renewals from the Chinese store lapping. Are they renewing at about the same pace that you would normally expect first year renewals relative to prior store openings in new geographies?\nRichard Galanti: One of the unique things, if I go back over the last 15 years when we've opened in new countries, you have outsized new sign-ups and, frankly, probably some that are just lucky of us. And so you have a lower-than-average renewal rate to start with. When I look back at the 7 or 8 countries outside of the U.S. and Canada, I mean, there's 10 or so, but what we've seen is that instead of -- in the U.S. or Canada, we might add anywhere from 5,000 to 20,000 members in the first year, recognizing in some of these are existing markets. So you've got people shopping more often because they're closer to the new opening.  We've enjoyed in Korea, Taiwan, Japan and even more so in China 50,000 to 100,000 new member sign-ups when we open up. And then a year later, 1.5 years later, when they're renewing -- when that first batch is renewing for the first time to get to that 88-plus worldwide renewal rate and the 90.1 in the U.S. and Canada, it starts off, it could be anywhere from the high 50s to the mid-60s in that first year.  And I don't have in front of me what China is. But China is also outsized in that regard. I think we have close to 400,000 members in that 1 location. Remind you, it's a very large city and Costco entered as a well-known entity, notwithstanding the fact that it was our first one. So for all those reasons, it alone affected that worldwide renewal rate.  We're not surprised. And by the way, even whatever renewals, nonrenewals we've been -- that have been incurred, we've gotten more than that in terms of new sign-ups. I think at the end of about 3 months after we opened in China, which was August of '19, we had around 300,000 members, and I think now we have about 400,000. So even if we've lost a bunch, we've gained a bunch plus some more.\nLaura Champine: Understood. And then secondly, on the roughly 30 basis points decline in core margins on an ex gas basis, you mentioned that that is related in part to the sales shift back to lower-margin ancillary business. Was this the quarter where you're lapping the most extreme move away from ancillary? Or is it -- are we likely to see a similar impact as we move through the year?\nRichard Galanti: I think Q3 was probably the most. It will still be impactful in Q4, probably not as much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich from Evercore ISI.\nGregory Melich: Two questions. First on e-commerce and multichannel. Do you have an update on the penetration now for e-commerce? Is it 10% or close? And what are you seeing in terms of the percentage of members that use multichannel and what their renewal rates look like, if they're any different?\nRichard Galanti: First of all, I think it's about 7.5 or 8, and part of that is the huge shrink in gas.\nGregory Melich: Got it.\nRichard Galanti: And what was the other part of the question, Greg?\nGregory Melich: The other part of that was just for people that -- like what percentage of members actually use multichannel offering? Like used either 2-day or Instacart, is it majority that have used it? And then what do their renewals look like once they've used you in multiple channels?\nRichard Galanti: Somewhere around 45% of our members have used e-commerce. And the renewal rate is slightly better. I'm not talking about new members that signed up that have just used e-commerce, I'm talking about just how many people -- how many existing members have used e-commerce.\nGregory Melich: Got it. No, that's great. And then the second question was on gasoline, I just want to make sure I got this right. Do you have a number for what the gallons growth was? And a penny profit was up or down. I think -- I know it hurts the mix, but just where we are in that cycle right now with gas inflation?\nRichard Galanti: Gas dollar profits were down because we had a -- it was interesting. Notwithstanding the fact that -- well, if you think back again in the third quarter last year, it was mid-February effectively to mid-May. The first 4 -- 3 to 4 weeks of that, there was a frenzy. It was either pre-COVID or the frenzy of people hoarding and everything. So gas was pretty strong in those first few weeks.  Then it plummeted and -- but not withstanding the fact that it plummeted, pricing was less competitive. So we had a very strong P&L, as I think I'm sure I mentioned last year in the quarter, it was particularly strong. We had a fine gas profit this quarter. But last year was fine with a capital F.\nGregory Melich: Got it. And so the pressure on any penny profit that you can get when gallons are recovering, I mean gallons are recovering now. Are we at that stage?\nRichard Galanti: Yes, very much so.\nGregory Melich: Okay. And what's -- do you have a number that you can give us in the quarter?\nRichard Galanti: I have one I cannot give you. No, I can't. Gas has been -- for those of you who've known us for many years, gas used to be a business that, on a given day or week, on a fully allocated P&L, could actually lose a little or all the way to make a lot. And it would be very volatile. In a matter of a week or 2, it could switch from the top to the bottom there.  The normal over the last few years has been it is a profitable business, and there's still some outlying big profitable days and a lot more days that are just regularly profitable. But the fact that it's coming up and the fact that it is probably overall a little less competitive out there, but that's not just in the last few weeks, that's been over the last year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse.\nRobert Moskow: I want to know, do you have any data you can share about the demographics or income levels of the new members that you've picked up in the past year? Is it trending any differently than your typical new member growth? Is it younger? I think Tracy kind of asked this question already, but I wonder if you had any specifics.  And then lastly, I wanted to know, do you think you've got any benefit this quarter from consumers having just more money in their pocket from stimulus payments? Or is that not really characteristic of your membership?\nRichard Galanti: I don't have any economic average income demographics in front of me. I know when we look at new member sign-ups currently versus a year ago versus 2 and 3 years ago, we still are getting our share of younger people maybe a little younger than that right now simply because of e-com and what have you has helped a little bit on that area, but nothing discernibly different.  As it relates to where we helped -- when we've looked at things in the past as it relates to some unusual stimulus, our view is we haven't seen as big a benefit as some of the other discounters or general merchandise discounters have seen. But it can't hurt. So my guess is it certainly it's probably helped us some, but not as much as others.\nRobert Moskow: It probably helped a little, not a lot. Okay.\nRichard Galanti: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict from Baird.\nPeter Benedict: Richard, first question, just given the sourcing challenges around the pandemic, I'm just curious, any updated thoughts you have on your vertical sourcing initiatives? Anything being sped up or slowed down? Just what's your -- what's the latest update on that?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Well, look, I mean, in a big way, I think the fact that we've got 2 meat plants and a chicken plant and a bakery commissary and a couple of optical grinding labs, if anything, those things have helped us a little bit. They're at full production in a big way. When feed costs go up -- in the chicken plant, for example, we go out somewhat with feed costs, but I'm sure we don't hedge ourselves completely in either directions, but we've done a pretty good job of managing those costs. Yes, go ahead -- but nothing major there. And then what was the other question?\nPeter Benedict: No. Yes, I was just wondering if you accelerated any initiatives that you maybe had in the pipeline, given what you've seen in COVID? Or if there's been any maybe new areas of the business that you maybe weren't considering vertical before, but maybe now you are?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. I think the big one that has -- again, that has surprised us in the sense that we think there's lots of opportunity there is the whole Costco Logistics side. For a variety of reasons, not only handling it ourselves and controlling the destiny of delivery times. But actually, there's a number of items that we historically have drop-shipped, if you will. The supplier carries the inventory, the supplier sends it and, needless to say, there's a cost associated with that. As we get bigger and higher volume and do some of those things direct, we're able to basically improve the delivery time and lower the price, and we've seen that.  And then we're getting better at insulation. That's something that we will continue to improve on as well. So I think that's probably the one area. I don't -- there's nothing currently planned in terms of the next big chicken plant, if you will. There's going to still be significant money spent on fulfillment, in distribution and logistics, as I just mentioned earlier about our CapEx. Beyond that, there was one other thing I was going to mention, which I can't remember now. Why don't we take two more questions.\nPeter Benedict: No worries. Richard, just one follow-up on self-checkout, that effort you have. How penetrated is that across the chain right now? And what's been the member feedback? Are you guys pleased with the service you're giving there? Obviously, volumes are really high through the club, so I'm just curious on that.\nRichard Galanti: Self-checkout works. It's in 90-plus percent of our warehouses. I've seen locations where we started with 6, 2 stacks of 3, and now we're at 9 and 12 in a couple of locations. So it's working. Certainly, the customer likes it. And it improves the frontline and service. So -- and it's cost efficient.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets.\nJacob Chinitz: This is Jake Chinitz on for Scott. I know you've done a couple of things to stay more in touch with members, especially on the e-commerce side, for example, building a database of updated member e-mails. So can you just give us an update where that may be from a progression standpoint? And any results you've seen from that?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think we're improving and a lot of the improvement we're doing in terms of a better mobile site and is -- and better service to our members, and ability to communicate to our members. Hold on 1 second here.  In the last quarter -- I'm sorry, the last year, we've gone -- we've increased the number of e-mailable addresses by 24%. And we're seeing higher conversion rates, as I mentioned already. And we're doing more things in the warehouse with -- to drive traffic online as well. So I think all those things are working, and we'll continue to improve our mobile. I'll make a point on the next earnings call to talk about -- I mentioned on Q2 earnings call, there were kind of like 3 phases of upgrades to our mobile site starting in September and then over the next 6-or-so months after that. I'll make a point of pointing some of those things out. Recognizing some of those things others have been doing, and we're just getting around to do.  Why don't we take one more question and that will be it?\nOperator: Your last question, sir, comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo.\nEdward Kelly: Just first one for you, Richard, on timing and next openings in China. Any more detail on when that next door is going to open? And then you talked about good news coming on pace of maybe opening beyond that. Thoughts on the potential to accelerate there now that you've had that first store open for a while?\nRichard Galanti: Well, yes. I mean our view originally was we'd open 1, and even before that opening, we -- where would be 5 years hence, maybe we'd have 3. And my guess is today, we'll shoot for a number a little bigger than that, maybe 4 or 5. But there's a lot of -- there's a few irons in the fire over there, but those are the 2 that are signed, sealed and under construction.\nEdward Kelly: And the next opening, when is that scheduled for?\nRichard Galanti: I believe the fall -- hold on a second. Late next summer.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Calendar '22.\nRichard Galanti: Yes, calendar '22, which would be Q1 of '23.\nEdward Kelly: And then just one for -- on your business customer. Just remind us of your business customer mix. And then what are you seeing in that customer as things start to recover? Do you think there's any permanent damage to that business at all? Or do you expect it to just sort of come back with reopen?\nRichard Galanti: Look, there's fewer businesses. I mean yes, I think one of the things that recognize this change over our 37 years or so in business, if you go back in the first few years, it was probably 75-25 or 80-20 business to consumer. And consumers were buying a lot of institutional business items. Today, arguably while we're still a wholesaler and, certainly, business members are important to us, it's probably 75-25 the other way, 75 consumer. And recognize one of the reasons we've done our business center is to focus more on that as well. In fact, I think all 3 openings in Canada this coming quarter or this past quarter, are business centers. And our deliveries are starting to come back.  Look, at the end of the day, I don't have the statistics in front of me, but if there were -- for every 100 small restaurants, be it a food truck or takeout or ethnic, I don't know how many of them closed, probably not a lot, but was it 10 or 20, I don't know. And the others are coming back. So there's probably a little bit of detriment there. And as I mentioned earlier, though, our view is that we think some of the business, not just in the food area, will be sticky to us as well.\nOperator: There are no question at this time. Sir, you may continue.\nRichard Galanti: I would like to just say one last thing. At the end of the call before opening it to Q&A, I mentioned that our May sales release for the 4 weeks ending May 30 would be on Thursday, June 4. It's actually Thursday, June 3. So thanks for that correction. Thank you, everyone, and have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Galanti",
            "content": "Thank you, Sarah, and good afternoon to everyone. I'll start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law.  In today's press release, we reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 to 12 weeks ended this past May 9. Reported net income for the quarter was $1.220 billion, or $2.75 per diluted share. Last year's third quarter net income was \u2013 they came in at $838 million, or $1.89 per share. This year's third quarter included $57 million pre-tax, or $0.09 per share in COVID-19-related costs. Last year's third quarter included $283 million pre-tax, or $0.47 per share of COVID-19-related costs.  Net sales for the quarter increased year-over-year in the quarter by 21.7% from $44.38 billion -- to $44.38 billion this year from $36.45 billion a year ago. Comparable sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 were as follows: in the U.S., on a reported basis, sales were - comparable sales were up 18%, ex gas inflation, up 15.2%; Canada, on a reported basis, up 32.3%, ex both gas and strong Canadian dollar, ex gas and FX, up 16.7%; other international reported plus 22.9%, ex gas and FX, plus 13.1%. All told, company reported comp sales of 20.6% and, again, ex gas and FX, 15.1% up; e-commerce, on a reported basis, was 41.2%, ex FX was up 38.2%, and that's on top of a year ago in the third quarter when it was up 66.1% in Q3 a year ago versus the prior year to that.  In terms of Q3 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 12.5% worldwide and plus 11.9% in the U.S. Our average transaction or ticket was up 7.3% worldwide and up 5.7% U.S. during the third quarter. And these numbers include the positive impact both of gas inflation and FX. So adjusting for that, they would be in the 1.8% and 2.7% in the U.S. adjusted for those.  Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted sales by approximately 290 basis points. And gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 260 basis points.  Going down the income statement. Membership fee income reported for the third quarter, $901 million or 2.03% of sales. Again, we had strong FX, and so adjusting for that out, the $86 million reported increase would have been up $67 million, so FX up 8.2%, on a reported basis, up 10.6%.  In terms of renewal rates, the U.S. and Canadian rate of -- came in at 91.0%, the same as it was at Q2 end. Worldwide, our total company renewal rate was 88.4% at Q3 end or 0.1% lower during the prior quarter-end. China entered the renewal calculation for the first time this fiscal quarter. First year renewal rates generally lag those of later years. And excluding China, the worldwide rate would have actually improved 0.1% versus the prior quarter.  In terms of number of members at Q3 end, both member households and total cardholders. At the end of third quarter, total paid households 60.6 million, up from 59.7 million 12 weeks earlier. Total cardholders, 109.8 million, up from 108.3 million at the end of the second quarter 12 weeks ago. At Q3 end, paid executive membership totaled 24.6 million members, an increase of 817,000 during the 12 weeks since Q2 end.  Moving down the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin in the third quarter was lower year-over-year by 35 basis points, coming in at 11.18% compared to a year ago at 11.53%.  As I usually do, I ask you to jot down a few numbers, two columns: both the reported year-over-year change in gross margin; and the second column, ex gas inflation. Merchandise core, reported minus 52 basis points year-over-year and ex gas inflation, minus 29 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses reported plus 2 basis points and ex gas inflation plus 7 basis points. 2% Reward, plus 1 basis point and minus 2 basis points. Other, plus 14 basis points in both columns. Total, therefore, reported gross margin, again, year-over-year was reported down 35 basis points and ex gas inflation down 10 basis points.  The core merchandise component, as you show here, was -- as I mentioned here, was down 52 basis points year-over-year on -- and down 29% on ex gas inflation. This is primarily a function of sales shifting from core to ancillary versus last year as we begin to revert back to more historical sales penetrations. Recall, last year, we saw a significant shift of sales out of ancillary and other businesses and into the core.  In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in third quarter, the core and core margin were better by plus 27 basis points, with nonfoods up significantly, rebounding from last year's lows. Food and sundries flat year-over-year and fresh foods down from last year, the latter still strong by historical standards.  Fresh, as we've mentioned over the last few quarters, is lapping exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outsized sales that began a year ago in Q3 with the onset of COVID. Ancillary and other business gross margins, again, ex gas inflation was up 7 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. We have a lot going on here as of last year we \u2013 as last year, we had closed the hearing aid and optical departments and had severely limited the service and selection at our food courts for most of Q3 last year.  Gas had a particularly good quarter a year ago, which had helped to offset some of those closures a year ago. This year, we're showing margin improvement in optical, food court, e-com and hearing aids, somewhat offset by gas.  The 2% Reward was, again, on excluding gas inflation, was lower by 2 basis points, indicating higher sales penetration to our executive members and the rewards associated with it. And other is plus 14 basis points. 9 of the 14 basis points is attributable to lower COVID-19 costs year-over-year. $44 million hit to margin in Q3 a year ago versus a $14 million hit to margin this year in the third quarter. Last year, we incurred 10 weeks of the incremental $2 an hour premium wage. This -- that portion you see here relates to the labor associated with our fulfillment manufacturing businesses. This year, we incurred two weeks of the incremental two-hour -- the incremental $2 an hour premium wage as the program was discontinued at the end of the second week of Q3 after 52 weeks in place.  The other plus 5 basis points or $19.7 million came from accruing a reserve last year in Q3 for certain third-party gift cards and ticket programs that were adversely impacted by the onset of COVID. One other comment, as I discussed during our March 4 Q2 earnings conference call. In conjunction with the discontinuing of the $2 an hour premium pay, we implemented a permanent wage increase for our hourly employees as well as most of our salaried manager employees, which took effect in week three of this fiscal quarter. Since it's a permanent wage increase going forward, its impact is simply in our reported numbers and not separated out as COVID-related. Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the third quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 107 basis points. Again to jot down these following 2 columns and numbers, first column is reported, and second column, excluding gas inflation. In terms of operations, year-over-year, plus 37 basis points, meaning lower or better by 37 basis points, ex gas inflation, plus 20 basis points. Central plus 4 basis points and plus 1 basis point; stock compensation, plus 5 and plus 4; other, plus 61 and plus 61. For a total, on a reported basis, again, SG&A year-over-year was lower or better by 107 basis points on a reported basis and excluding gas inflation, better by -- or lower by 86 basis points.  Again, looking here, the core operation was better by 37 and plus -- better by 20, excluding the impact of gas inflation. A good result, particularly given that we implemented a permanent $1 an hour wage increase for the last 10 of the 12 weeks that comprise Q3. Central, nothing surprising there. Same with stock comp, and other, the plus 61 basis points ex gas inflation, 56 of the 61 was attributable to the lower cost from COVID. $239 million hits SG&A in Q3 a year ago compared to $44 million in Q3 this year. The balance or plus 5 basis points, lower by 5 basis points, was $18.5 million were cost associated with the acquisition and integration of Innovel a year ago.  Next on the income statement is preopening expense. Basically, this year, it was -- it came in at $10 million, $2 million higher than the $8 million in Q3 of fiscal '20. Nothing out of the ordinary with the preopening this quarter.  All told, reported operating income in Q3 '21 increased 41%, coming in at $1.663 billion this year compared to $1.179 billion a year ago in the quarter.  Below the operating income line, interest expense was $40 million this year versus $37 million a year ago. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $6 million or better by $6 million. Interest income was actually lower by $2 million year-over-year due to lower interest rates. Additionally, FX and other was higher by $8 million year-over-year.  Overall, reported pretax income in the third quarter was up -- reported pretax income was up 42%, coming in at $1.650 billion this year compared to $1.163 billion a year ago. In terms of e-commerce, our e-commerce sales, as I mentioned earlier -- I'm sorry, before I go to e-commerce, our tax rate in the third quarter came in at 25.2% compared to 26.7% a year earlier. This quarter benefited from onetime discrete tax item that benefited our number.  For all of '21, based on our estimates, which, of course, are, sadly, subject to change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total company tax rate for the year to be in the 26% to 27% range. A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, in Q3, we opened 6 new warehouses, 1 in the U.S.; 3 in Canada; and 2 internationally. We also have plans in Q4 to open 7 additional ones, 5 in the U.S. and 2 others internationally. And that would put us in a total of 21 net new warehouses for the fiscal year, 23 -- which included 2 relocations, so 21 net.  In addition to the 21 planned openings for fiscal '21, we are looking to open about 25 new units, net new units in each of the next 2 fiscal years, including a second warehouse in China in fiscal '22, which would be the end of -- towards the end of calendar '21 and a third expected to open in late calendar '22, which would be early fiscal year '23.  Regarding CapEx, the third quarter fiscal '21 spend was approximately $1.03 billion. Our full year CapEx spend is now estimated to be in the $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion range, increased a little from our estimate made 12 weeks earlier to include the recent $340 million purchase of a distribution facility on the West Coast to support our big and bulky delivery activities.  Now going -- turning to e-commerce. Again, e-commerce sales in the third quarter ex FX increased 38.2% year-over-year. Stronger departments included jewelry, home furnishings, sporting goods, hardware and majors, which, of course, includes both everything from appliances to consumer electronics.  In terms of Costco Logistics and an update there, we anniversary-ed the purchase of Innovel, now called Costco Logistics this fiscal quarter. Costco Logistics continues to drive big and bulky sales with the U.S. e-com sales on these items up 53% during the quarter.  Costco Logistics fulfilled about 70% of all U.S. big and bulky orders, and we also continue to add some new big and bulky vendors. Overall, we've improved delivery time on many items from up to 2 weeks to in many -- in several cases, now 5 to 7 days. As well, we've taken several items that were previously vendor-drop shipped that are now -- and are now being direct imported allowing us to not only speed up delivery but reduce prices to our members.  From a supply chain perspective, port delays are continuing to have an impact. We are utilizing additional carriers, in some cases, to help alleviate some of that. Containers and pallets are also facing shortages anecdotally, 35% to 50% increase in incoming containers this year versus a year ago. Some of that's pent-up demand, but just from the low points a year ago. The turnaround of a container hitting the U.S., delivering its contents and being back at the U.S. port to head back overseas has gone from approximately 25 days to 50 days. So a combination of things in terms of delays.  Chips shortages are impacting many items from an inflation standpoint, some items more than others. And again, as I mentioned, with regard to containers and shipping, transportation costs have increased as well. Despite these issues, we continue to work to mitigate cost increases and supply chain delays in a variety of different ways as best we can. The biggest way we've handled supply chain delays is adjusted ordering and front-loading, if you will, orders of many items. And we think we've got that pretty well under control.  This will continue -- the feeling is that this will continue for the most part of this calendar year. We've had a lot of questions about inflation over the past few months. There have been and are a variety of inflationary pressures that we and others are seeing. Inflationary factors abound. These include higher labor costs, higher freight costs, higher transportation demand, along with the container shortage and port delays that I mentioned, increased demand in various product categories some shortages, various shortages of everything from chips to oils and chemical supplies by facilities hit by the Gulf freeze and storms and, in some cases, higher commodity prices.  Some inflationary sound bites, if you will. Price increases on items shipped across the ocean with suppliers paying up to double for containers and shipping. Price increases of pulp, paper goods, some things up 4% to 8%, plastic and resin increases from trash bags to plastic cups, plates, et cetera, and plastic wraps. Metals, aluminum foil, mid-single-digit cost increases also cans for sodas and other beverages. Higher import prices on cheeses, the combination of the product itself as well as some FX strength of some foreign currencies as well as freight, anywhere from 3% to 10% increases on certain apparel items, not all.  In terms of fresh, higher protein prices, for example, meat overall year-over-year is up 7%. Beef in the last month has been up as much as 20%. Some of that is due to feed labor and transportation costs as well as restocking some of the additional increased demand coming now from institutional needs as restaurants start to reopen. And the list could go on and on.  Now all this being said, I was asked back on our March 4 -- second quarter call. At what level we felt inflation was running overall at that time with our goods. I stated that our best guess was somewhere in the 1% to 1.5% range. As of today, we guess that overall price inflation at the selling level, and excluding our gasoline sales, would be estimated to be probably more in the 2.5% to 3.5% range.  Some items are up more and some items, the sale prices haven't yet changed. And some items are even down a little bit. We think, again, we've done pretty well in terms of controlling that as best as we can, but the inflation pressures abound.  In terms of sampling and demos in the warehouse, as you all know, we eliminated our popular food sampling and demo activities in our warehouses last March at the onset of the pandemic. As various states opened and closed last summer and fall, we tried a few sampling events. A few single-serve items like cookies and crackers, take-out only, no cook to prepared sample items and a few enhanced talking demos such as items for display only.  I'm happy to report that over the next couple of weeks, we're beginning a phased return to full sampling. This will come in waves. The first wave of locations, about 170 of our 550-ish locations in the U.S. will be activated by the first week of June, with most of the remaining locations returning towards the near -- or towards the end of June. The first wave will actually determine how fast we roll out and what and when restrictions are lifted. I'm sure there will be a few states with unique restrictions as well.  Increased safety protocols are and will be in place, including all samples prepared behind plexiglass, prepared in smaller batches for better safety control and distribute it to members one at a time.  Food courts, same thing as well. I'm pleased to report that our food courts are also coming back over the next few weeks in a bigger way. Last March, again in 2020 as the pandemic took hold, we pared back menu basically to hotdogs and pizza and soda and smoothies, and we eliminated all seating, those takeout only. We began several weeks ago adding back tables and seating and -- at a handful of outdoor food courts in a few states.  Over the past few months, we've also added back a few more food items, including bringing back a new and improved churros, which will be at all U.S. locations by the 4th of July, and adding a high-end soft ice cream to replace our frozen yogurt.  And by June 7, we plan to have tables in seating back at most locations, but with more physical separation, tables of 4 instead of 6 and 8 and about half the seating capacity as we had before. Again, these are still subject to doing this in waves and see how it goes and subject to any additional state rules or restrictions in a few cases.  Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results. For the 4 weeks ending the Sunday, May 30, on next Thursday, June 4 after market closes. With that, I will open up to questions and answers, and I'll turn it back over to Sarah. Sarah? Well, I mean, we'll have -- of course, Michael, we'll have to wait and see. I mean, our view is, is that while historically, we want to be -- mitigate those increases and work with our vendors and try to be as efficient as possible to lower those pressure points, some of it will pass through, and some of it has passed through. From a competitive standpoint, our view is it has not really impacted our margins in any big way. Some of the inflationary pressures, some very simple examples might be things like our $4.99 rotisserie chicken and our $2.99 40-packet of water. Those have stayed the same, notwithstanding there's been some pressure on some cost components of these items. So those are already impacting our margins a little. And I don't -- I think overall, relative to competition, that's not going to be an impact -- a big impact of where we go margin-wise. Sure. Well, look, we focus first on driving more value. And I would like to think that some of the benefits that we've had in terms of strong business over the last -- not only the last year with COVID, certainly, we've been helped by the fact that we've been deemed an essential business and the strength in fresh and food items has helped quite a bit as well and buying things for the home. But I think we've gained market share on top of that, and that's all about value. I mean, our model is -- our view is our model is intact as it relates to the best prices on the best quality goods and services. And certainly, our buying power keeps improving in that regard. We've added things as it relates to different forms of procuring the merchandise, whether it's in-store or a big increase like many people with e-commerce. Certainly, our acquisition of what's now called Costco Logistics has been a big boom for our -- we believe, for our sales strength and competitiveness in those areas. So we think from a value proposition standpoint, the value of what we offer our members keeps going up.  As it relates to fee increases, historically, we've done it about every five years, so we would expect now to start getting questions since this is a year before that, and our answer is pretty straightforward. We'll have to wait and see. But we certainly feel good about our competitive position. Thanks. Sure. Well, there's always different pieces to that equation. As I mentioned, one of the things that we mentioned over the last few quarters was particularly strong fresh foods margins with higher labor productivity and much lower products spoilage. While, again, we're still above where we were pre-COVID, it's come down a little from its peak a year ago in Q3, but still nonetheless better than historical numbers.  One of the things that I mentioned picked up was nonfood. Again, the strength that we've seen in nonfoods has continued. It really started in the summer when people buying things for their home. Outside of that, certainly, I would expect on an ancillary business, taking gas out of it for a minute because that goes up and down at -- with a lot of factors causing it who the heck knows. But at the end of the day, if you look at some of the other ancillary businesses, I would expect to see, of course, margin improvement with optical and hearing aid relative to a year ago, for sure, even in Q4.  Same thing with travel. Travel is coming back as we see on the news every night. Travel is coming back in a big way with the improvement with COVID as well as probably a lot of pent-up demand. And we're seeing that ourselves in our travel business. And that's a high-margin business, although a small piece of the total sales action for the company.  So I think, overall, we seem to figure out how to get there in different ways, even something like Costco Logistics that in the last three-or-so quarters, I pointed out, it was a 5 to 7 basis point hit to margin. It's finally -- anniversary-ed some of that, and hopefully, we'll start to show some improvement. But there's little things like that that might show you a little improvement in the future.  So -- but overall, it gets back to our ability to price our goods to - for great value and being competitive and still hopefully improving the bottom line will continue. But we'll let you know each quarter. Well, look, I think, first of all, we look at what we can do with our own blinders on. There has been a lot of CPG companies, both in paper goods, soda pop that have announced increases. And many of them are sticking because we and other retailers are aware of the underlying costs associated with it. I think we -- I'd like to think we can do as good a job as any given our purchasing power and limited number of SKUs that can mitigate that as best we can. To the extent that those are happening, the fact that, on average, our competitors are taking those probably as fast as not a little faster than us is a positive. But we've taken some price increases on things that have gone up. Right. What's -- I guess, most interesting is, other than from an age standpoint, being a demographic that's so -- the next young generation of Gen Z or millennials before that and Gen Y or whatever else, we're getting our share of them. We did see over the -- as COVID hit, there was, of course, a spike not only -- there was a big spike, a big increase with same-day fresh delivery in many -- in most cases, with us with our relationship with Instacart. And also doing ourselves two-day dry grocery and some other items. And again, anecdotally, we know that we garnered some additional members that way. On the 2-day, since that is done via mostly UPS, you may have -- we've gotten some members that are outside of our geographic market areas of physical warehouses, but not a big giant number. So overall, I think if anything, we've seen our continued strength of adding net new members to existing warehouses.  Certainly, opening new warehouses helps and perhaps getting a few related to the online next-day delivery of fresh and things like that. Beyond that, again, when we see who from -- again, from an age demographic, we're getting -- we think that we're getting our good share of younger people as we did in previous. That was -- historically, that was sometimes a concern of some on Wall Street. Is this for the older generation? And what we're finding is as long as we keep changing our product mix to gear towards our -- who the member is, and in our case, when you see what we've done with organics over the last 10 years or more now, and summer sporting equipment and you name it, we get our fair share of those people. I think what's interesting is -- yes, it was a little lower last year because we were just being hit with it. And so while we were scurrying to get merchandise in, we would also -- if you recall, back in March and early April, as we were realizing like everybody else that this was going to last longer, we were starting to cut back where we could seasonal orders and might have reduced our patio furniture needs for the part of the summer season and some of our Halloween needs and Christmas needs.  And then we found out that we needed it even more. So probably some of it has to do with the fact that it being a little lower. And then as what I talked to earlier in this call about front-loading and buying early, that's -- we are happy to have some extra inventory. We clearly have a lot of -- we have plenty of cash to do that. And certainly, the cost of buying forward a little bit on some of these things is de minimis relative to what we earn on our cash. Well, again, it's hard to figure all these out because so many things were happening particularly last year in April, May, June time frame. What we saw is the states that opened a little early, we started seeing a little bit more shopping frequency a little earlier like Texas and Florida, but not in a meaningful discernible way. Trend-wise, yes, but not like let's wait for that everywhere.  But even in states that have been a little bit more closed, I mean the U.S., in particular, has opened up quite a bit in the last 1 month, 1.5 months as evidenced by new CDC guidelines and I think the spring weather in general, and so -- and just the pent-up interest in doing that. So I think a lot of that's already in there.  And in other countries, in Canada, there's still some -- for much of the last fiscal quarter, in about 38 of the 101 or 102 Costcos in Canada, one of the main provinces, there was limitations on -- we had to cordon off nonessential items or so nonfood items. We can only sell food and cleaning supplies and paper goods and health and beauty and the like. So -- but that's -- even that is, I think, in a big way pretty much over. Yes. Yes, again, a big chunk of that is the $2 an hour premium, which has been eliminated. And again, mind you that there'll still be a chunk related to the $1 permanent -- mostly $1 permanent wage increase that we did. Sure. I think first and foremost, it's sales, strong sales. This is a business that we know the benefits -- the operating leverage we got when we could do a 7% comp instead of a 4 or 5, and enjoying the comps that we have now, that's the biggest single piece of it. If anything, in the quarter, health care cost probably a little higher because people weren't going for their regular doctor visits a year ago in the third quarter. And so that was probably a little bit of a hit. But more -- what offsets all those types of anecdotal things is strong sales and just a core labor costs. Gas as well, taking gas inflation out of there would reduce that a little bit. No. Actually, the 5-year mark is next June. Philosophically, I get to think about not thinking about it for several months. No, jokes aside, again, we feel good about our member loyalty. Needless to say, with our renewal rates, we feel very good about our competitive position. But there's -- we really haven't given a lot of thought yet. Yes. I think it's -- my guess is it's probably not as impactful now. The third party, most particularly the same-day fresh delivery really peaked last, I want to say, May or April, late April. And where -- it was huge and, I mean, it was tenfold increase. And it's now probably halved, still huge relative to pre-pandemic. But -- so it's not as impactful as it was. So again, I think there are a couple of quarters where we had -- a couple of quarters ago, we had like an 86% comp in e-commerce.  And we said that if you added back the stuff that we don't put in there like same-day fresh since third parties come in and buy it in the warehouse and take it to you, that 86% -- that 85% or 86% was up towards 100%. If you just -- this is -- I'm shooting from the hip here, but if that was 15 percentage points, let's assume it's 5 to 8 percentage points, but certainly not 15. Well, we were proving -- not to say that we don't have a few complaints every day from someone that screwed something up. But at the end of the day, we're improving in a big way. We actually were aggressive on pricing immediately. It's kind of like when we went into a new country like France or Spain, we're pricing in low volume, less efficient departments like fresh as if we were doing a lot of volume. And so those are examples where it's hurting us to start with as it relates to -- we're going to price the goods or lower the price of a mattress or a furniture set delivery based on what we can do before we actually do it.  Now that's thankfully catching up for itself -- with itself. In terms of capacity, it has a lot of capacity. As I mentioned, right now, about 70% of our big and bulky is now delivered through Costco Logistics. Some of it was being delivered by third parties that we're doing fine, but now we're doing it ourselves. That business, as I mentioned, is continuing to grow very handily not only for us but industry-wide with furniture and things for the home, exercise equipment, TVs and the like. And we think that we have tremendous capacity available. What we bought was at a capacity of less than 50% of what it had been doing itself a few years before. But again, those aren't completely -- you can't completely compare those two.  What we just bought was a huge facility and acreage that allow us to do more big and bulky and recognizing so many things come in from overseas in big and bulky, and it's again on the West Coast in California. And so it's going to help us continue to grow that business.  We think we have a lot of growth. Way before COVID and more big and bulky and everything else, recall in the U.S., what we saw over the last 5 years, I think it was 5 years ago, we said in just white goods when all we did was sell them in store, we did about $50 million. And the year pre-COVID, 3 years hence, we did about $750 million or something. We're well beyond that now, both natural growth as well as what COVID has done in terms of people buying things for the home and then us being able to become more competitive on pricing.  We've seen items, not across the board, but items where we've lowered the price by 10% and 15% or more, greatly improved the delivery time and are driving that business. It's really too early, John, to tell. We just started that 3 weeks ago, and something that our people in that operation wanted to try. And business centers, it's -- we think it's something that lends itself well to our business customer needs as well, and we'll see. Yes. I don't have that detail in front of me. We're seeing 30% and 50% increases on items within some of those categories, everything from outdoor patio furniture or indoor furniture to mattresses to exercise equipment, the TVs along the way. Well, yes, I mean, first of all, I think that when we look at our 3- to 5-year plan, we think there will be outsized growth certainly for the next 3-plus years, we'll see. In terms of adding SKUs, yes, but we're not going crazy. Certainly, there's more SKUs online furniture sets, sofa and chair sets. We might have 1 or 2 on display, sometimes, in a warehouse, we'll have a dozen or so online. So we are adding both vendor names as well as additional selection, but still greatly limited relative to the traditional retail of those items. Sorry about that. Scott, let's go back to your question. My apologies. You can start again. Well, I think some other countries tend to be a little slower and challenged, but we have beefed it up. That's one of the reasons I think that I went out as far as I did by saying 25 in each of the next 2 years. We feel relatively confident that the -- all the items that we have in the fire right now, both U.S. and Canada as well as other parts of the world, we feel good about. We've got a lot of things going on.  Now going from 25 to 35, I'm not sure we're prepared to do that yet. Could we do it? Yes. But certainly, in some of the countries that are smaller, we like to go slow. And I mean, we picked up the pace in China by now having 2 ready either under construction or getting ready to be under construction and to open over the next 18 months. And for us, that's faster than we would have gone. And you'll see more announcements both there and elsewhere over the next few quarters. Well, there's a few different things. I mean if I look at travel, I think, in the last month, we probably had 10 of our top 15 days ever in our history, so even at holiday time in '19. Part of that, again, though, was the pent-up demand. So we'll see where it normalizes out. Right now, both car rentals, we also pivoted and added in addition to -- while cruises are still down, they're being booked again now, but still down.  We did a big push starting several months ago to negotiate and offer some great deals on other, what I'll call, U.S., Mexico and Hawaii-type trips -- vacation trips.  Yes. So bookings, they're not revenue yet, but bookings are particularly strong now. And hearing aid, you had a little bit of the same issue when they were essentially closed down because of direct one-to-one contact, when you're getting fitted for a hearing aid. There was a lot of pent-up demand that we've seen and we continue to see, the same with optical. We think that will continue to be normalized, but we'll have to wait and see.  Food courts is probably going to take another several months. Having tables out there will help, expanding the menu will help. And of course, pharmacy didn't really ever see a big dramatic downturn. Well, I mean, our 40,000-foot view of that is that what was gained because of food away from home stopping a year ago, and while it picked up some with takeout and delivery, it's now starting to improve a little bit, but some of that's going to be sticky. I don't know what the exact number is going to be, but our view is, is that it still certainly hasn't reverted back.  I mean restaurants are just beginning to open in a bigger way. In many cases, still people are reluctant to go in. In many cases, the tables are further separated. So some of that's going to continue for the next 6-plus months, is my guess. Beyond that, when all is said and done, will some of it still be sticky? Our view is probably the fact that we, as a company, have done a pretty good job of staying in stock and certainly the quality of our fresh foods, I think that we've not only benefited from that. I'd like to think that we gain market share from other traditional food retailers in that regard, particularly on the fresh side. I think the one factor that was a little a bit of an anomaly is as we -- just in the last year, we expanded executive membership to Japan where we have 29 locations, 28 locations -- 29 locations, and including 2 new Japan locations this quarter. And as a company, I think, overall, we continue to get better at signing people up as executive members, telling them what the virtue of it is and doing a better job of having a higher percentage of every 100 new members that sign up as well as converting.  I think within that 817,000 something just under 200,000 was Japan. So even taking that out, I think it was 180-something thousand. So even taking that out, the 6 30 or 40 pluses, it was still a very strong number for the quarter outside of that. It's still a test. We're still just doing it in New Mexico in 3 locations. And the utilization of it, when we first did it, we marketed a little bit. The utilization has not set the world on fire in terms of where it's trending. One of the unique things, if I go back over the last 15 years when we've opened in new countries, you have outsized new sign-ups and, frankly, probably some that are just lucky of us. And so you have a lower-than-average renewal rate to start with. When I look back at the 7 or 8 countries outside of the U.S. and Canada, I mean, there's 10 or so, but what we've seen is that instead of -- in the U.S. or Canada, we might add anywhere from 5,000 to 20,000 members in the first year, recognizing in some of these are existing markets. So you've got people shopping more often because they're closer to the new opening.  We've enjoyed in Korea, Taiwan, Japan and even more so in China 50,000 to 100,000 new member sign-ups when we open up. And then a year later, 1.5 years later, when they're renewing -- when that first batch is renewing for the first time to get to that 88-plus worldwide renewal rate and the 90.1 in the U.S. and Canada, it starts off, it could be anywhere from the high 50s to the mid-60s in that first year.  And I don't have in front of me what China is. But China is also outsized in that regard. I think we have close to 400,000 members in that 1 location. Remind you, it's a very large city and Costco entered as a well-known entity, notwithstanding the fact that it was our first one. So for all those reasons, it alone affected that worldwide renewal rate.  We're not surprised. And by the way, even whatever renewals, nonrenewals we've been -- that have been incurred, we've gotten more than that in terms of new sign-ups. I think at the end of about 3 months after we opened in China, which was August of '19, we had around 300,000 members, and I think now we have about 400,000. So even if we've lost a bunch, we've gained a bunch plus some more. I think Q3 was probably the most. It will still be impactful in Q4, probably not as much. First of all, I think it's about 7.5 or 8, and part of that is the huge shrink in gas. And what was the other part of the question, Greg? Somewhere around 45% of our members have used e-commerce. And the renewal rate is slightly better. I'm not talking about new members that signed up that have just used e-commerce, I'm talking about just how many people -- how many existing members have used e-commerce. Gas dollar profits were down because we had a -- it was interesting. Notwithstanding the fact that -- well, if you think back again in the third quarter last year, it was mid-February effectively to mid-May. The first 4 -- 3 to 4 weeks of that, there was a frenzy. It was either pre-COVID or the frenzy of people hoarding and everything. So gas was pretty strong in those first few weeks.  Then it plummeted and -- but not withstanding the fact that it plummeted, pricing was less competitive. So we had a very strong P&L, as I think I'm sure I mentioned last year in the quarter, it was particularly strong. We had a fine gas profit this quarter. But last year was fine with a capital F. Yes, very much so. I have one I cannot give you. No, I can't. Gas has been -- for those of you who've known us for many years, gas used to be a business that, on a given day or week, on a fully allocated P&L, could actually lose a little or all the way to make a lot. And it would be very volatile. In a matter of a week or 2, it could switch from the top to the bottom there.  The normal over the last few years has been it is a profitable business, and there's still some outlying big profitable days and a lot more days that are just regularly profitable. But the fact that it's coming up and the fact that it is probably overall a little less competitive out there, but that's not just in the last few weeks, that's been over the last year. I don't have any economic average income demographics in front of me. I know when we look at new member sign-ups currently versus a year ago versus 2 and 3 years ago, we still are getting our share of younger people maybe a little younger than that right now simply because of e-com and what have you has helped a little bit on that area, but nothing discernibly different.  As it relates to where we helped -- when we've looked at things in the past as it relates to some unusual stimulus, our view is we haven't seen as big a benefit as some of the other discounters or general merchandise discounters have seen. But it can't hurt. So my guess is it certainly it's probably helped us some, but not as much as others. Yes. Yes. Well, look, I mean, in a big way, I think the fact that we've got 2 meat plants and a chicken plant and a bakery commissary and a couple of optical grinding labs, if anything, those things have helped us a little bit. They're at full production in a big way. When feed costs go up -- in the chicken plant, for example, we go out somewhat with feed costs, but I'm sure we don't hedge ourselves completely in either directions, but we've done a pretty good job of managing those costs. Yes, go ahead -- but nothing major there. And then what was the other question? Yes. I think the big one that has -- again, that has surprised us in the sense that we think there's lots of opportunity there is the whole Costco Logistics side. For a variety of reasons, not only handling it ourselves and controlling the destiny of delivery times. But actually, there's a number of items that we historically have drop-shipped, if you will. The supplier carries the inventory, the supplier sends it and, needless to say, there's a cost associated with that. As we get bigger and higher volume and do some of those things direct, we're able to basically improve the delivery time and lower the price, and we've seen that.  And then we're getting better at insulation. That's something that we will continue to improve on as well. So I think that's probably the one area. I don't -- there's nothing currently planned in terms of the next big chicken plant, if you will. There's going to still be significant money spent on fulfillment, in distribution and logistics, as I just mentioned earlier about our CapEx. Beyond that, there was one other thing I was going to mention, which I can't remember now. Why don't we take two more questions. Self-checkout works. It's in 90-plus percent of our warehouses. I've seen locations where we started with 6, 2 stacks of 3, and now we're at 9 and 12 in a couple of locations. So it's working. Certainly, the customer likes it. And it improves the frontline and service. So -- and it's cost efficient. Well, I think we're improving and a lot of the improvement we're doing in terms of a better mobile site and is -- and better service to our members, and ability to communicate to our members. Hold on 1 second here.  In the last quarter -- I'm sorry, the last year, we've gone -- we've increased the number of e-mailable addresses by 24%. And we're seeing higher conversion rates, as I mentioned already. And we're doing more things in the warehouse with -- to drive traffic online as well. So I think all those things are working, and we'll continue to improve our mobile. I'll make a point on the next earnings call to talk about -- I mentioned on Q2 earnings call, there were kind of like 3 phases of upgrades to our mobile site starting in September and then over the next 6-or-so months after that. I'll make a point of pointing some of those things out. Recognizing some of those things others have been doing, and we're just getting around to do.  Why don't we take one more question and that will be it? Well, yes. I mean our view originally was we'd open 1, and even before that opening, we -- where would be 5 years hence, maybe we'd have 3. And my guess is today, we'll shoot for a number a little bigger than that, maybe 4 or 5. But there's a lot of -- there's a few irons in the fire over there, but those are the 2 that are signed, sealed and under construction. I believe the fall -- hold on a second. Late next summer. Yes, calendar '22, which would be Q1 of '23. Look, there's fewer businesses. I mean yes, I think one of the things that recognize this change over our 37 years or so in business, if you go back in the first few years, it was probably 75-25 or 80-20 business to consumer. And consumers were buying a lot of institutional business items. Today, arguably while we're still a wholesaler and, certainly, business members are important to us, it's probably 75-25 the other way, 75 consumer. And recognize one of the reasons we've done our business center is to focus more on that as well. In fact, I think all 3 openings in Canada this coming quarter or this past quarter, are business centers. And our deliveries are starting to come back.  Look, at the end of the day, I don't have the statistics in front of me, but if there were -- for every 100 small restaurants, be it a food truck or takeout or ethnic, I don't know how many of them closed, probably not a lot, but was it 10 or 20, I don't know. And the others are coming back. So there's probably a little bit of detriment there. And as I mentioned earlier, though, our view is that we think some of the business, not just in the food area, will be sticky to us as well. I would like to just say one last thing. At the end of the call before opening it to Q&A, I mentioned that our May sales release for the 4 weeks ending May 30 would be on Thursday, June 4. It's actually Thursday, June 3. So thanks for that correction. Thank you, everyone, and have a good day."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Q2 Earnings Call and February Sales Conference. I would now like to hand the call over to your speaker today, Mr. Richard Galanti. You may begin your conference.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you, [Buena] [ph], and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those outlined in today\u2019s call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the Company\u2019s public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the Company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today\u2019s press release, we reported operating results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the 12 weeks ended February 14, as well as February retail sales results for the four weeks ended this past Sunday, February 28. Reported net income for the quarter was $951 million or $2.14 per share, compared to $931 million or $2.10 per diluted share last year. This year\u2019s results included $246 million pre-tax or $0.41 per diluted share and costs incurred primarily from COVID-19 premium wages. Net sales for the quarter increased 14.7% to $43.89 billion from $38.26 billion a year ago in the second quarter. Comparable sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 were as follows. For the 12-week period U.S. comps were reported at 11.4% and excluding gas deflation and FX 12.6%. Canada reported at 13.4%, ex gas deflation and FX 10.6%. Other International reported at 21.5%, ex gas deflation and FX 17.7%. All told, total Company reported at 13.0% and ex gas deflation and FX 12.9%. E-commerce on a reported basis was 75.8% and FX 74.8%. In terms of the second quarter comp sales metrics, our traffic or shopping frequency increased 1% worldwide and up 2.7% in the U.S. on a year-over-year basis during the quarter. Our average transaction or ticket was up 11.9% total Company and 8.5% in the U.S. during the second quarter. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted sales by approximately 110 basis points and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 100 basis points. I\u2019ll review our February sales results a little bit later in the call. Going down the income statement, membership fee income came in reported at $881.5 million or 2.01%, compared to $816.4 million or 2.13% in the quarter a year ago, so up $65 million or 8%. Excluding the impact of FX, the $65 million increase would be $56 million, which would represent a 6.9% increase, excluding the impact of FX. No openings occurred in fiscal \u2013 in the second fiscal quarter both this year and last year in the fiscal quarter. In terms of renewal rates, the U.S. and Canadian renewal rate came in at as of for Q2 at 91.0% as of Q2 end. This was up 0.1% from the 90.9% at the end of the prior fiscal quarter. Worldwide our total Company renewal rates were 88.5%, as of Q2 end also up 0.1% from the prior quarter\u2019s number of 88.4%. In terms of number of members as of Q2 end, both member households and cardholders, in terms of households at Q2 end we came in at 59.7 million, up from 59.1 million 12 weeks earlier and total cardholders 108.3 million, up from 107.1 million 12 weeks earlier. As of Q2 end paid executive members were 23.8 million, an increase of 506,000 during the 12 weeks since Q1 end. Moving down the income statement to the gross margin, this year\u2019s gross margin came in at 10.96%, 2 basis points lower than last year\u2019s second quarter on a reported basis of 10.98%. Excluding gas deflation, it would have been 11 basis points lower. As I always ask you, do a little chart here to show some of the components of margin. Two columns, reported and the second column without gas deflation. First line item would be core merchandise. On a reported basis core merchandise margin year-over-year was came in at plus 71 basis points, ex gas deflation, plus 63 basis points. Second line item, ancillary businesses, minus 53 basis points and then without gas minus 55 basis points. 2% reward, minus 6 and minus 5. Other minus 14 and minus 14. So all told on a reported basis year-over-year minus 2 basis points and again ex gas deflation minus 11 basis points. So as you can see from this chart, the core merchandise component was higher ex gas deflation by 63 basis points. Similar to the last several fiscal quarters\u2019 sales penetration has shifted to the core business, resulting in higher contribution of our total gross margin dollars coming from the core operations versus a year earlier. Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation only to their own sales, core on core, if you will, margins year-over-year were higher by 71 basis points. Fresh foods was again the biggest driver here. With strong sales in fresh, we benefited from the efficiency gains and labor productivity and significantly lower spoilage. That being said, the other three major merchandise categories, food and sundries, softlines and hardlines all had higher margin percentages year-over-year in the quarter as well. Ancillary and other business gross margin was lower by 53 basis points and by 55 ex gas deflation in the quarter with most of the negative impact coming from gas and to a lesser extent from the aggregate of travel, hearing aids, pharmacy and food courts offset a little bit by a positive impact from e-com. Costco Logistics, which was our Innovel acquisition a year ago, impacted ancillary margins by 6 basis points to the negative. 2% reward, you can see was impacted negatively by 5 basis points implying that more higher penetration of our sales are coming from the executive membership group. And other is the minus 14 basis points. All of this is attributable to the cost of COVID-19 or about $60 million of the $246 million previously mentioned. These are the direct costs for incremental wages allocated to our manufacturing, production and fulfillment operations. Moving on to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the second quarter was higher or worse year-over-year by 11 basis points on a reported basis, coming in at 9.89% versus 9.78% a year earlier. The minus 11 ex gas deflation would have been a minus 3. Again, doing a little chart of comparison with two columns, both reported and then without gas deflation. First line item would be operations, plus 31, so lower or better by 31 basis points. Core operations was on a reported basis. Without gas deflation plus 38, so lower or better by 38 basis points. Central minus 3 basis points and minus 2. Stock compensation plus 3 and plus 3 and other minus 42 and minus 42. You add those columns up on a reported basis again, SG&A was higher year-over-year by 11 basis points and ex gas deflation higher by 3. The core operations component when you look at that was better by 31 or 38 excluding the impact from deflation. SG&A in the core, excluding the COVID-related expenses, which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment, was significantly leveraged with a strong core merchandise sales increases. Central, again minus 2 ex gas deflation stock comp, plus 3 both small year-over-year basis points changes together pretty much awash. And other was a minus 42 basis points hit to SG&A, which were incremental wage and benefit costs related to COVID or $186 million of that $246 million total amount. So $60 million of the $246 million hits the margin and $186 million of the $246 million hits SG&A. I\u2019d like to take a minute here and discuss our COVID-related expenses and how they\u2019re changing effective this past Monday, March 1. Over the past 12-month period, March 2020 through February 2021 companywide we expended approximately $1.60 billion pretax on COVID-related items. Of this amount, approximately $825 million related specifically to the $2 an hour extra hourly pay. The remaining $200 million plus was made up of several other items, including the few month period where employees 65 and older were paid to stay home. This was early on during the original lockdowns, cleaning of mass supplies, paying wages to several \u2013 for several weeks to our third-party demo service employees and assisting employees with pay childcare leave which continues. With the $2 an hour extra pay having been paid in for full year that extra amount has been discontinued as of this past Sunday, February 28. And effective March 1, a few days ago, we have implemented a permanent wage increase for hourly employees as well as most salaried warehouse employees. In the U.S. and Canada, we are permanently increasing our starting wage and most wage steps above that by a $1 an hour and increasing our top of scale hourly wage by $0.45 an hour on top of the previously planned $0.55 an hour increase for top of scale. With these changes, our entry level hourly wages will increase from $15 and $15.50 an hour to $16 and $16.50 an hour. Similar type increases are occurring in other countries where we operate. With this change, along with the reduction and/or elimination of several components of the $200 million plus expenses I just discussed, on a going-forward basis this $1 billion plus expensed over the past 12 months will be reduced by a little over one-half starting March 1, which is the beginning of week three in the current fiscal third quarter. Next on the income statement is preopening expense, pretty much the same year-over-year. This year came in at $9 million compared to last year\u2019s $7 million, so $2 million higher. In both fiscal quarters there were zero openings, although this relates to upcoming openings as well. All told, reported operating income for the second quarter of 2021, including the $246 million mentioned earlier showed an increase of 5.8% coming in at $1.340 billion this year compared to $1.266 billion last year. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $40 million this year versus $34 million last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was lower by $26 million year-over-year. Interest income itself was lower by $19 million due to lower interest rates. Additionally, FX and other was lower by $7 million. Overall reported pre-tax income in the second quarter was up 3.3% coming at $1.319 billion this year compared to $1.277 billion a year earlier. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the second quarter was 26.4%, a little higher than the 25.9% recorded in Q2 of last year. For all of 2021 based on our current estimates, which of course these are always subject to change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total Company tax rate for the fiscal year to be in the 26% to 27% range. A few other items of note, in terms of warehouse expansion, as I mentioned, we \u2013 there were no openings in Q2. There were eight net new openings in Q1. So we\u2019re eight year-to-date in the second half of the fiscal year, but this quarter, in the fourth fiscal quarter we plan to open 13 more net new units. Five of those will be in the U.S., three will be in Canada and five will be in overseas. Regarding CapEx, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we spent approximately $573 million. Our full year CapEx spend is still estimated in the $3 billion to $3.2 billion range. Moving onto e-commerce, e-commerce sales overall for the quarter ex FX increased 75% year-over-year. A few of the stronger departments over the counter and pharmacy, garden and patio, small electrics, health and beauty and majors, including consumer electronics, total online grocery grew at a very strong rate in the second quarter. The comp numbers just mentioned follow our usual convention. Our usual convention, which excludes our third-party same-day grocery program, which was up 450% year-over-year in the quarter. If we include the third-party same-day in our e-com comps, the 76% reported comp number would have been 96%. Costco Logistics, formerly known as Innovel continues to fulfill a greater percentage of our delivery items and has steadily increased since its acquisition a year ago March. In Q2, we made it a priority to enhance our white club service, which includes assembly or complex installation. It\u2019s now standard on many items and offered as an upgrade on many others. Turning to COVID-19 and some of the issues and impacts surrounding it, we continued to enjoy strong core merchandise sales. I think our buying teams have done a great job keeping our building with stock despite outsized demand on some items and some supply chain challenges as well. From a supply chain perspective, overseas rate has continued to be an issue in regards to container shortage and port delays. This has caused timing delays on certain categories, including furniture, sporting goods, lawn and garden and even some food and sundries items like seafood, imported cheeses and oils. We expect these pressures to ease in the coming months, but it\u2019s impacting everyone, of course. Regarding the pressures from high consumer demand, examples of areas where we have some supply issues on the non-food side, certain electronics due to chip and component shortages like TVs, computers and smart home related items, exercise equipment, bikes and outdoor activity items, lawn and garden items and appliances. On the food side, canned beverages have some shortages due mostly to the aluminum can issue of shortages. Bacon is up 45% in pounds and so for whatever reason, there is a lot of demand there. So there is a little bit of challenges there. Gloves, surface cleaning, wipes and sanitizing sprays and some paper goods. Fresh foods overall is looking pretty good. Our three warehouse curbside pickup test in Albuquerque is ongoing. We don\u2019t really have a lot to add at this time as the test is recent and continuing. The pilot is going well. Our members have responded to it and basket size has actually surpassed our expectations. Our focus of course is how can we be more efficient in doing it and determining if this offering can become scalable and makes a firm sense for us. Turning to our February sales results, the four weeks ended this past Sunday, February 28, compared to the same period last year. As reported in our release, net sales for the month of February came in at $14.05 billion, an increase of 15.2% from $12.2 billion last year. Again, going down the numbers that were in the release. On the U.S. reported basis were up \u2013 on a same-store sale basis were up 10.3%. That\u2019s both reported and without gas and FX. Canada reported 21.6%, ex FX 15.7%. Other International 25.7%, ex FX 20.6%. Total Company 13.8% reported, ex gas and FX 12.3%. Within those numbers e-com 91.1% reported and without gas and FX 89.4%. As with the quarter these numbers \u2013 the e-com numbers would be higher if we included the third-party same-day fresh. When we discussed last year\u2019s February sales results, we pointed out that the fourth week last year had a big uptick in sales. That\u2019s kind of was the beginning of what we felt was a little bit of consumer \u2013 pressure for consumers to buy in for fear of lockdown, again primarily related to consumers buying ahead of the anticipated COVID lockdowns and closures. That positively impacted last year\u2019s February sales by approximately 3 percentage points. Similarly, sales in week four of this February, this week \u2013 week four of this year February were lower as we anniversaried that unusually strong week from a year ago. The estimated negative impact to the February month was approximately 3.5 percentage points. So the reported numbers of 13.8% and ex-gas and FX of 12.3% would have been higher excluding that impact. Our comp traffic or frequency for February was flat to last year worldwide and up 0.7% in the U.S., again some impact of that last week. Worldwide the average transaction was up 13.8%, which included positive impacts of 140 basis points from FX and 10 basis points of the gas inflation. Foreign currencies year-over-year relative to the dollar benefited February comps in Canada by 540 basis points, Other International by approximately 570 basis points and total Company by 140 basis points. Gas price inflation again positively impacted total reported comp sales by about 10 basis points, whereas the average selling price was about a percentage point higher year-over-year. In terms of regional and merchandising categories, the general highlights U.S. regions with strong results for South East, Mid West and Texas. Internationally in local currencies, we saw the strongest results in Korea, UK and Japan. Moving to merchandise highlights, the following comp sales results by category for the month and these exclude the positive impact of FX. Food and sundries were in the positive high-single digits. Departments with the strongest results were liquor, frozen foods and cooler. Hardlines were positive in the high 20%s. Better performing departments were toys and seasonal, sporting goods, hardware and majors, which again is both white goods and consumer electronics for the most part. Softlines were up \u2013 also up in the low 20%s. Better performing departments included housewares, small appliances and home furnishings. And finally, fresh foods were up in the low 20%s. Better performing departments included meat and deli. Ancillary business sales, as mentioned earlier, were down and they were down in terms of sales in the mid-single digits in February, primarily due to lower year-over-year sales in food court hearing aids and gasoline. Overall, relatively a good fiscal second quarter impacted, of course, by COVID expenses, impacted both plus and minus by various aspects of our business due to COVID and certainly as I mentioned in the ancillary, gas had the biggest of the ancillary hits. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases we will announce our March sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, April 4 on Wednesday, April 7 after the market close. With that, I will open it up to Q&A and turn it back to Lena.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Michael Lasser of UBS. Your line is open.\nMichael Lasser: Good evening, Richard. Thank you for taking my question. My first question is on the gross margin expansion that Costco is [doing] [ph] over the last few quarters. Can we assume that as sales slow that you\u2019re just going to give back a lot of these gross margin gain constraints going to go up and all the efficiencies that come along with double-digit comp go away. Or is there anything that Costco has learned that it\u2019s now doing differently that will allow it to hold on to these gross margin [gains] [ph]?\nRichard Galanti: Well, first of all, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re doing anything dramatically -. we were going to do anything dramatically different. I mean we\u2019re already pretty aggressive on a lot of things. And of course, we\u2019re always trying to drive sales with aggressive value and pricing. Probably the one area which can be a challenge or will be a challenge at some point is fresh. The particular strength in fresh foods for the last several quarters on a year-over-year basis has been the strong fresh has led to higher labor productivity, which is part of the cost component of that if you will manufacturing businesses as well as a lower spoilage or what we call damaged and destroyed in many cases given the strength you\u2019re not throwing away as much stuff at the end of the day or a week, and you\u2019re again be much more productive from a labor efficiency standpoint. At some point, that will subside is my guess. Beyond that, we feel pretty good about our ability to be very competitive and price along that way.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. And you said going on the - wage expense, going forward this billion dollar plus expense will reduced a little by half early March 1 given the permanent wage increases. So we should just say half the $1 billion or $500 million of expense that Costco has incurred over the last four quarters is not going to go away, even though your wages will be increasing, your SG&A dollars should go down?\nRichard Galanti: Well, SG&A, and then as I mentioned earlier, the COVID related premium wages the $2, that $800 plus million, a piece of that hit margin because of our manufacturing businesses, the labor involved on the manufacturing side, that\u2019s part of cost of sales. And so again, if you looked at those proportions, I think on the $246 million, we said $60 million related to margin hit and $186 million related to SG&A hit. A simple guess would be you could take that type of percentage of these numbers and apply it quarterly may be a little bit more to SG&A than that those percentages. And so, yes, if you looked at the $1.60 billion that we talked about, and we say a little over half, so simple math would suggest a little over half of that should come back. Although, we\u2019ll stop talking about COVID-related expenses too as we\u2019ve now anniversaried it.\nMichael Lasser: Understood. Thanks again, Richard.\nOperator: Your next question is from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimeon Gutman: Hey Richard, how are you? My first question is also on gross margin. Can you \u2013 I just want to clarify, because there was a big swing in the reported number. Core on core looked pretty healthy, very similar to the prior quarter. You said I think plus 71. And so the big swing here was pretty much mostly gas or all gasoline. And can you remind us, when does the gasoline margin compare peak? Does it get worse before it gets better?\nRichard Galanti: I \u2013 year ago in the third quarter, we\u2019ve pointed out that it helped us. But it\u2019s like it\u2019s \u2013 it is gas, it is volatile and the profitability in gas goes up and down dramatically. It\u2019s a meaningful business for us. And as prices go up, we generally make less, which has happened of late. And I think not just for us, but the supermarket chains, the other discount stores that operate chains of gas stations. And so we \u2013 again directly try to point that out each time. But there\u2019s no rhyme or reason it can change on a dime.\nSimeon Gutman: Fair enough. And I guess just to clarify, but it is right the core looks like it was consistent with prior quarters, the big swing and the reported was just then the remainder was mostly due to gas in this quarter, right. Why it was down\u2026\nRichard Galanti: Right. Gas is more than half of all those other things [indiscernible] certainly travel is impacted as you well know right now, probably one of - the food courts, because we\u2019re still not open with seating, essentially [indiscernible] as well. So all those are impacting, but gas is \u2013 was the prime mover there. I was looking back at last year, what we call again, what we call warehouse and other businesses, which again gas is a meaning when there are big swings, it tends to be gas is the biggest component of that. A year ago in Q1 versus a year earlier, that\u2019d be Q1 2020 versus 2019. That number I don\u2019t have the detail on gas, but it was 19 basis points to the positive. In Q2 year-over-year, it was 2 to the negative. In Q3, it was 21 to the positive. In Q4 it was 71 to the negative. So you can see it fluctuates. This year in the first quarter, it was 22 to the negative and now 55 to the negative. And again, there\u2019s a lot of components of that number, not just gas, but gas generally tends to be the big mover there.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then my follow-up question is on SG&A. If you look at SG&A year-to-date, so Q1 and Q2, and you exclude all the premium pay, right. We are excluding it from this year, even from last year, it looks like SG&A is still taking a step up year-over-year that\u2019s higher than what looks normal like in prior years. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s incremental wage changes. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything else that\u2019s changed in the business this year-to-date from an SG&A perspective, you\u2019ll have easier comparisons because the premium stuff starts coming up in the back half. But is there any reason why you structurally stepped up in the first half of this year.\nRichard Galanti: Dollar was \u2013 well, I think it\u2019s a strong sales as a percentage of sales actually, I think you\u2019ll find it goes directionally better.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay, yes. I was looking on \u2013 yes.\nRichard Galanti: I\u2019m looking at core operations for all of fiscal 2020 versus all of fiscal 2019 on an ex gas deflation basis was lower or better by 25 basis points. Again, that\u2019s not \u2013 we separate out that below the quarterly stuff or the unusual stuff, the COVID stuff, but the core business was lower or had lower or better SG&A percent by 25 basis points for the entire year. This year in the first two quarters, it was plus 62 and plus 38. So that\u2019s on average 50.\nSimeon Gutman: Fair enough. Okay. Thank you, Richard.\nOperator: Your next question is from Chris Horvers of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nChris Horvers: Thanks. Good evening. So I wanted to follow-up on that February commentary. So last February 2020, you did add a nine and that lasts or you did a 12 and that last week at [a 200] [ph] basis points. So that would suggest you did about a 20 in that the last week of February. And just doing the math, that would suggest that you were just slightly down if it was a 350 base point headwind down maybe on like a stack basis maybe like 1% or 2%. Is that right?\nRichard Galanti: No, I think I agree with what you said about last year. This year the first three weeks were a little over a 17 and the last week brought that 17 down to our 13.8.\nChris Horvers: Right, okay. So yes, you were down.\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Maybe I explained it differently each year, but yes, basically the 13.8 reported, what \u2013 for the first three weeks was a low 17 and the fourth week caused it to be a 13.8 for the whole four weeks.\nChris Horvers: Right. So sorry, your comp down \u2013 right, so your comp down high teens basically. So that \u2013 so as you look ahead it\u2019s interesting because, but at the same time, as you look forward to comparisons remain tough, but you also meter traffic in your stores quite aggressively. I mean I think peers are up double-digits in the month of March and April and you\u2019re actually down in April. So can you talk about to what degree do you think you actually left business on the table, as we think about just trying to model out against these comparisons going forward?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I can\u2019t speak for others. We\u2019re frankly thrilled with our sales numbers in our and how we\u2019ve done over the course of the last year. As you look at both March and our fiscal third quarter March, this giant step up in sales and traffic and hoarding, if you will, by customers started in week four of February and lasted through about 2.5 weeks into March. So we\u2019ll talk about it specifically when we report March sales, as it relates to the fiscal quarter, which is essentially mid-February to mid-May, I don\u2019t have the exact dates in front of me, but that 12-week period and included not only that tough comparison for those 3, 3.5 weeks, which included week four February and weeks, one, two, and part of three in March, but also when there was a lockdown and offset and that, and kind of late March into April and even early May, we had some very tough compares. And so that\u2019ll make it in our view, all things be equal, an easier comparison. So I think there\u2019s going to be a plus and a minus that probably add up to about even we\u2019ll see. The next challenge of course, will be Q4, which is a mid-May through the end of August. That\u2019s what we enjoyed comps in the 12% to 15% range on an ongoing basis into September, October as well. But for Q4 where we saw a lot of strengths, not only on the food side, but on the non-food side as people are buying things for the home as they weren\u2019t traveling or going to sporting events and the like.\nChris Horvers: Okay. And I just want to follow back up on the February math, sorry to delay this, but it was \u2013 where you actually modestly positive in that last week, it just under comped the average and it brought it down.\nRichard Galanti: Modestly positive, yes.\nChris Horvers: Got it. Understood. Thanks very much.\nRichard Galanti: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question is from Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.\nChuck Grom: Hey, thanks a lot, Richard. I know that\u2019s kind of has been a drag on the top line, but when you look at your business geographically and overlay that with markets that are maybe a bit farther along in the reopen process. Just I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve noticed any improvement in gas gallons.\nRichard Galanti: You are a little bit, overall I mean our gas gallons year-over-year, I think in was February the quarter and the quarter were down 9% or 10%, which is an improvement \u2013 relative improvement. And within that, in some of the regions like in the South, Texas, Florida, you\u2019ve seen a little better improvement.\nChuck Grom: Okay, great. Thank you. And then just on the balance sheet inventory dollars are up 17% \u2013 roughly 17% is a little bit ahead of sales. I guess how are you feeling about the currency of inventory as you transition out of for insurance and some of the spring items?\nRichard Galanti: Yes, we made a conscious effort a couple of months ago. I think even on the last quarterly call, we talked a little bit about some of the challenges with port delays both on the farm side of where the merchandise is coming from, as well as the ports along the West Coast of North America in particular and container shortages. So we were front-loading and not everything came in short. So we have frontloaded items that are not seasonal items or frontloaded extra inventory of basics. And so I\u2019m not concerned about that at all.\nChuck Grom: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mike Baker of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nMike Baker: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to ask about your view on inflation, obviously pricing in the market. One of your big competitors talk about being satisfied with their price gaps, which maybe means it\u2019ll be a little bit less pricing pressure out there. So how do you think about that? And again, how do you think about inflation it\u2019s spiked mid-year sort of moderating a little bit, but now commodity costs back up, maybe it goes up again from here.\nRichard Galanti: Well, I\u2019d say in the last several months, we\u2019ve seen a little more inflation than we had in part because of some of the container shortages, freight costs are a little higher, there\u2019s some high demand items or product shortages due to supply chain in general, that we want up. When asked on a broad stroke basis on some of these items, what type of inflation we\u2019re seeing, sometimes as much as 2% to 4%, sometimes less than that. And on meat, it\u2019s trended upward in the mid-singles, pork in the high-singles. That\u2019s why bacon, I mentioned bacon and \u2013 but we feel good about our competitive ability. We\u2019re \u2013 we always want to be the last to raise and the first to lower. And but we feel, again, as you look at our margins, we feel good about where our margins are coming in and our ability to be very competitive out there.\nMike Baker: Okay. That makes sense. So are we seeing our panic buying and bacon yet or not at that point yet?\nRichard Galanti: Probably tomorrow, because I mentioned it.\nMike Baker: Exactly. I\u2019m heading there tonight. Thanks.\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Karen Short of Barclays. Your line is open.\nKaren Short: Hi, thanks. I wanted to get back to this SG&A and/or I guess gross margin question. So when I look at the EBIT growth in this quarter versus sales growth, and I back out COVID costs. The second quarter was by far the narrowest gap. So 3Q, 4Q, 1Q, 2Q like you were a third of what you were in 1Q, like half \u2013 more than half or less than half of what you were in 4Q, 3Q. So it clearly is a question of like the gross profit dollar growth versus the SG&A growth. So I guess I\u2019m wondering, can you just talk through that a little bit more, because the change in this quarter, this is somewhat glaring.\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Well, I think again Karen gets back to gas. Gas is a high sales dollar number and the impact to somebody put me on mute please. The impact of gas is both dollars and average price to lower gross margin as well. That\u2019s really the biggest piece of it.\nKaren Short: Right. But I\u2019m talking EBIT dollar growth, excluding COVID costs versus the sales. So I guess, yes, I mean I guess sales I have to adjust for gas, but it just still seems like a very widespread or why\u2026\nRichard Galanti: Well, I can just, again, without being specific \u2013 dollar specific, the biggest dollar impact year-over-year profitability of, if I \u2013 when I mentioned these various pluses and minuses was gas.\nKaren Short: Okay.\nRichard Galanti: And the combination in it\u2019s a 10%-ish piece of our business, which had a lower gross margin and lower dollar price per gallon. Both of those things would touch to lower sales, lower profits, and that\u2019s impacted.\nKaren Short: Okay. And then just turning to the forward look on gross margin, obviously appreciating the fact that strength and the fresh strength will hurt potentially gross margins as we get into the next couple months. But ancillary should I guess help offset some of that appreciating gas may is you can\u2019t predict that, but can you maybe talk through the dollar buckets of gross profit dollars in the other categories within ancillary?\nRichard Galanti: Well, again, travel should improve recognizing how much will reprove we\u2019ll wait to see, but its starting to improve a little bit. Food courts will improve the same thing as we start to put out seating and expand what we offer there. Now when that occurs and how that occurs, we\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019re probably going to do it in certain regions first and go from there. Gas is the big unknown in the big guesstimate of which direction it goes each week. But we\u2019ll, again, try to point that out to you. Here, we\u2019ve seen a \u2013 we have seen a period improvement in hearing aid and optical.\nKaren Short: Okay. And then just last one for me. Is there any impact of the SG&A dollars from the enhanced white glove service that you could call out?\nRichard Galanti: There is a better efficiencies, although keep in mind, we\u2019ve really grown this thing fast of taking our \u2013 some of our existing, not only have these departments grown dramatically in the last year. We were using third parties for a lot of it, and we continue to push more on there and to improve the service, to lower the price. And so I think you should see that should continue to improve, but it was not without its costs to accomplish all that in the last quarter.\nKaren Short: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Paul Lejuez of Citigroup. Your line is open\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey everyone, [indiscernible] on for Paul. I was wondering if we could circle back on the inflation question and kind of go through some of the puts and takes of inflation items that you\u2019ll be anniversary coming up in the coming quarters.\nRichard Galanti: Well, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re anniversary any of them as soon. It\u2019s just starting to happen in the last month or two. And again, a lot of it has to do in our view. You\u2019ve had a little bit of inflation over the last year with on things like paper goods, because of just a huge demand in the shortages. But in terms of some of the recent things with container shortages and port issues, some supply issues on chips and components of big ticket items as you know cost of Steelers up 50% to 100%. All those things impact that. I think it\u2019s more \u2013 if this has happened in the last several months versus a year ago.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Can you quantify the impact of freight costs and some of the container issues that ahead on this most recent quarter?\nRichard Galanti: I can\u2019t off with the notes that I have in front of me. I mean, anecdotally, if you look at what is the cost per container coming over used to be its up 10% to 15%.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s it for now. Thank you.\nRichard Galanti: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question is from Scott Mushkin of R5 Capital. Your line is open.\nScott Mushkin: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. So I kind of wanted to think about the business more strategically Richard and understand, we went through a period where you did the Citibank deal, and then you guys didn\u2019t talk too much about it, but you really expanded your fresh offerings, which I think helped the clogs and drive some traffic. I was wondering if you think about the business over the next couple of years, and we think about kind of self-help initiatives. Where do you think there\u2019s some levers that you guys can pull?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think first of all, some of them are ongoing. Kirkland Signature continues to be something that will continue to increase the offerings that we do. There aren\u2019t a giant billion dollar ones, items like that. There\u2019s a handful of items like paper towels and toilet paper and water that are huge. There\u2019s the cake cups and those things that are in the hundreds of millions of dollars, but there\u2019s lots of 20s to 100s out there. And we continue to do that with all kinds of quality, organic packaged food items as well. I think one of the things that we\u2019ve seen from some of our vertical integration starting to pay off, we\u2019ve got the chicken facility at full capacity now. We\u2019ve got a great bakery commissary, we \u2013 two years ago, we opened a second meat plant. We\u2019re seeing some improvement from that. We\u2019re also starting to identify items that historically we manufactured in one place, generally the United States, and then shipped all over the world, whether it\u2019s roasting of nuts and cashews. And yes, and doing bringing all that product from where it\u2019s grown to the U.S. for roasting and packaging and shipping out worldwide. We now have a supplier in Asia that is doing all the needs for Asia, Australia, and dramatically we\u2019re able to \u2013 or dramatically reduce the price and drive sales and drive bottom line dollars for us. We\u2019re doing that with all kinds of \u2013 we\u2019re looking at all kinds of avenues to do that with from paper goods to things like that as well. So I think these are long-term opportunities, but there should be a lot of them over the next several years. Also e-com notwithstanding, our start back in the early 2000s, we like everybody has that\u2019s become more important over the last year in particular, it\u2019s approaching 10% of our business and continue to grow nicely and we\u2019re driving \u2013 we\u2019re getting better at doing it and getting more clicks and the like, and that regard. So I think e-commerce and then the big and bulky our acquisition of Innovel last March, all you see now, and we pointed out, I think for the last three fiscal quarters, a 6 or 7 basis point hit to gross margin as it relates to the \u2013 it\u2019s like in manufacturing, it\u2019s a service business that goes ultimately back into our cost of sales, what that thing costs. Notwithstanding the fact that that has helped drive sales of big and bulky items. And in fact, lowered the prices to our members on some of those items. So we think that\u2019s as expected, it was going to be earnings dilutive at the operation standpoint for the first couple of years and be fine there, but more as importantly, if not more importantly growing big and bulky as part of our business, we\u2019re seeing big \u2013 continued big increases from mattresses to white goods to exercise equipment, notwithstanding the fact that there\u2019s been some shortages in some of those items.\nScott Mushkin: That\u2019s great. Thanks for all the color. That was perfect.\nOperator: Your next question is from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nScot Ciccarelli: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. So as you guys get food inflation on meat, pork, et cetera, our price increases there a direct pass through to the customer. Or do you guys try to be sticky on some of your prices the way you have been with rotisserie chickens, for example.\nRichard Galanti: I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be as extreme as the old chicken example from 15 years ago, where we stuck with continue to stay at 499 and figure out ways how to do that. But certainly, we are \u2013 we want to be the last, we want to be as sticky as possible and hold off and we\u2019ll wait until our cost has come through the system. But overall, particularly on fresh items, those prices probably change more often than not both at traditional supermarkets, as well as the Costco\u2019s world.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. And then you\u2026\nRichard Galanti: And in fact, the other thing I want to mention is, we\u2019re a little unique in terms of our product mix. When you look at it, we\u2019re selling part of our meat business is prime. And those are the types of things where we can get a strong margin for us and show you a greater savings because the markups traditionally on something like that special item, or even higher at traditional retail outlets. So we think overall we\u2019re a good stead in that regard.\nScot Ciccarelli: That\u2019s helpful, Richard. And then you did mention your chicken plant, as you know, I think it\u2019s been for a bit fully up and running. Are you generating the efficiencies you guys originally anticipated when you first went down that, that road?\nRichard Galanti: We\u2019re pretty close. I mean we\u2019re at full production, which is similar. There\u2019s been some puts and tastes. We \u2013 as we built it, we decided to put in additional things that we think provide for higher quality product like air chilling and things like that. The COVID expenses certainly have impacted us more than nobody had planned for it. So that of course, should improve over the next year. I think it\u2019s \u2013 the feed costs, we\u2019ve been fortunate. Historically, we\u2019ve been \u2013 the first year we were fortunate feed costs are coming up a little bit, but we\u2019re also finding that the chickens are growing a little better than we thought. And so all those things add up to we feel pretty good about it.\nScot Ciccarelli: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question is from Greg Melich of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nGreg Melich: Hi, thanks. I just \u2013 I want to start just to clarify the inflation at the risk of being for a comment on it. You said that there are items that are higher, right. But the 2% to 4% comment, Richard, was that saying what you actually think it is now in your average ticket? Or is that just saying some items are in other words just, would you estimate the whole benefits like 1% or 2% right now?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Some categories are in that 2% to 4% range and some are little, I mentioned are like meat and pork are a little higher than that, produces flat, but I \u2013 we don\u2019t do life anymore, but I think if you look at our costs on average, the view is probably flat up 1%, 1.5%, but somewhere in that range that\u2019s I guess.\nGreg Melich: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for that clarification. Second is what you went through the renewal rates, I guess as you\u2019re thinking about it now what do you think you could really get renewal rates to, and maybe tie it in with some of the other things you have to really drive loyalty, like the credit card program. Any update there in terms of what sort of engagement you have with it, what percentage of customers or sales are on the card to help us understand where that renewal rate could be trending?\nRichard Galanti: Sure. Well, look, what we internally call the triple plays, not only getting to become a member, but upgrade to the executive member and then to apply and get the Citi Visa card, recognizing that not everybody that applies for it gets it based on credits that\u2019s \u2013 that credit decision is made by issuing bank, not by us. And the \u2013 sorry, I lost my train of thought, but renewal rate \u2013 in terms of improving renewal rate, as we do add people to the credit card and to executive membership, both of those things tend to increase provide for more loyal customer or a high renewal rate. Also we\u2019re doing more things to get you to auto-renew whether it\u2019s on the Citi Visa card or working on some other areas right now as well, to be sent we get you to auto renew by almost a facto there\u2019s going to be a high renewal rate on those as well. First and foremost, ultimately if the things we do to make you want to remain a member of Costco, we think that some of those things like upgrading to executive membership, which we\u2019ve shown you continues to be part of our quarterly positive there, as well as getting more people to auto renew. Can you hear me?\nGreg Melich: Yes, I can. That\u2019s better.\nRichard Galanti: Sorry.\nGreg Melich: We heard that, okay. And last, is there any hope on travel bookings? And I sort of glimpse is there that still depressed?\nRichard Galanti: It is coming back, but it\u2019s the same thing I said back in the spring, in the summer when there was some easing of COVID statistics and people were starting to book out for Christmas and even into the winter and spring of 2021, but they did it knowing that there was generally full cancellation capabilities. We\u2019re now seeing, and as you might expect, many of those things were canceled. Now we\u2019re seeing the same thing again. We\u2019ve also \u2013 travel department, we\u2019re doing pretty well, relatively speaking on car rentals. And as it relates to travel and hotel bookings, we have added some additional domestic items and Mexico items for the domestic \u2013 for the U.S. domestic market as well. Hawaii and Mexico are pretty strong. Again, within the relative framework, there is some four and five star things that we\u2019ve gotten in other parts of the world, which wouldn\u2019t talk to us a few years ago, but so, we\u2019re optimistic it\u2019s going to come back and expected. And we\u2019ve certainly, I think improved our offerings.\nGreg Melich: Excellent. I guess putting a hard pressure monitors across from the bacon going forward and good luck.\nRichard Galanti: There\u2019s a fast food retailer out there that has a interesting name for that. Anyway, why don\u2019t we have two more questions?\nOperator: Your next question is from Greg Badishkanian of Wolfe. Your line is open.\nSpencer Hanus: Hi, this is Spencer Hanus on for Greg. My first question is how should we think about how much of the share gains you have this year you\u2019ll retain. And then the low-single digit comp in the last week of February, how did that compare to your internal expectations?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I\u2019ll answer the last question first. I mean we \u2013 all we knew is that week four of February compared to a year ago and weeks one and two, and part of three of March were going to be tough compares. I think we actually did a little better than we thought, but still it was a low number given the strength a year ago. And I\u2019m sorry, what was your first question?\nSpencer Hanus: Market share, TV market share.\nRichard Galanti: TV market share, look at the end of the day, some of it\u2019s going to be sticky and some of it\u2019s not. We all personally hope that restaurants will reopen and we\u2019ll all be able to go out and enjoy and socialize that will impact retail food sales at Costco and supermarkets, and the likes to some extent. That being said there are other retail formats, whether it was restaurants and food that have closed for good, apparel retailers, other general merchandise retailers. So in some ways, some of the stickiness unfortunately relates to certain aspects of retail that have closed for good. And some of it will be that they\u2019ve gotten more comfortable buying some of these things from the likes of Costco. I hope we lose some of it to the examples of restaurants and the like, and other stores that were impacted as they can reopen. And \u2013 but I\u2019m sure that we will end up keeping a little bit of it as well.\nSpencer Hanus: That\u2019s helpful. And then for the new members that you\u2019ve recruited during COVID, how are they different than previous cohorts? And are you expecting to see renewal rates in line with the overall company average?\nRichard Galanti: Whenever we sign up a member, if you look at our 90% point whatever percent renewal rate in the U.S. and Canada, that includes some 10-year plus members that are 93% or 94% or 5%, and include some members that have in the last two years, that might be mid-70%s to mid-80%s. So you\u2019re always from zero to year one to renewal, it\u2019s going to be a lower rate in year one to year two, it\u2019s a combination of two-year members plus some new one-year members picks that renewal rate up. My guess is some of these new ones again, they\u2019re going to follow that format. The other thing though, is in some cases, we think we\u2019ve gotten new members sometimes in markets where we don\u2019t even operate physical stores, not a lot, but it can\u2019t hurt.\nSpencer Hanus: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nRupesh Parikh: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So Richard, I just wanted to ask you just about e-commerce fulfillment capacity. So you guys are obviously registered very strong growth last several months. So just curious where you guys are from a fulfillment perspective and whether you would expect to see a step up in investment going forward.\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think there has been a step up in the last couple of years, and it\u2019s continued this year. We are building additional fulfillment as we speak fulfillment capability. We\u2019re getting better at it, but so is everybody that\u2019s, I\u2019ve seen this kind of wild growth. In some ways, we think it may be easier for us because of the fewer items. We\u2019re doing the two-day groceries still through our business centers, which works pretty smoothly. So it is a larger percentage of the $3-ish billion we spend every year than it used to be, but certainly the biggest single percentage is still opening new warehouses.\nRupesh Parikh: Okay, great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. So clearly, you guys have \u2013 sorry, go ahead.\nRichard Galanti: In addition to physical capital expenditures, there\u2019s also IT capital expenditures, which is part of our CapEx as well. And there\u2019s a lot of investment in that around everything from e-commerce from mobile app to fulfillment in the like.\nRupesh Parikh: Okay, great. And then just given the announcement on the increase in minimum wages, do you see any other levers going forward that can offset some of the wage pressures that we\u2019ve seen maybe on a multi-year basis in your business?\nRichard Galanti: From the beginning, I used to think about that question 30 years ago. And what we find is, is that we\u2019re always able to, because we\u2019ve got a great employee base and that are hardworking and loyal and know that we care, we as a company are, they are cared about. I think that we feel that we\u2019ve seen over the years, everything from inventory shrink to labor productivity, certainly we measure these things too, but labor productivity, and a lot of it has to do with coming up with ideas many of which are these ideas come from our employees that are on the ground, if you will working in the meat department, figuring out how to be more efficient with pounds per hour, per labor hour. So we\u2019ve always figured out ways, not worried about let\u2019s figure out how to save it, and then we can give it, pass it onto them, let\u2019s pass it on and we\u2019ll get there from an efficiency standpoint. And it seems to have worked for us.\nRupesh Parikh: On the CapEx basis\u2026\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Other things like, we\u2019re now have self-checkout in 60% or 70% of our 558 Costco\u2019s in the U.S. It\u2019ll be on virtually all of them. And we\u2019ll see in another countries as well. That\u2019s the savings that took us awhile to believe part of it and to figure it out, I think we\u2019re on the third format of it, the version of it, but it\u2019s working in our environment the way we want it to, and we see savings there. So we\u2019re constantly figuring those things out. And we attribute a lot of that to many of these good ideas don\u2019t come from the rooms here at the office. They come from the people out on the floor.\nRupesh Parikh: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nEdward Kelly: Hi Richard, thanks for letting me here. I just want to go back, first of all on the ancillary gross margin, you talked about gas being a bit more than half, so the remainders pandemic related, I guess 15, 20 basis points. Has that drag been consistent there since the pandemic began? So if I look back over the other quarters, whatever sort of remainder there would just be the gas movement.\nRichard Galanti: Yes. I think it was worse last year in Q3 and \u2013 but it\u2019s been similar. It\u2019s improving a little right now, but still negative year-over-year. The big delta is as you had gas and quarters where we talked about gas was a big positive. It offset \u2013 more than offset some of these other negatives.\nEdward Kelly: Right. Okay. So we have that coming back when life normalizes, then when you look at the other segment of the gross margin, how much of that\u2019s going to come back because the 16 with the wage increase play a role there. So should I assume only half of that comes back?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think from simple math, we talked about the $246 million for this quarter in total for COVID-related and of that $60 million impacted margin. So $60 million over $246 million, whatever that percentage is a little under 25%. And on an annual basis, we talked about the $1.60 billion a little over half. So just take half of that. And that\u2019s kind of the net improvement or pre-tax improvement in margin from that. But there \u2013 I\u2019m sure if there\u2019s other outliers, we\u2019ll explain them to you as we go into each quarter. Some of the things that\u2019s a easy one, because it\u2019s big and we know what we\u2019re doing with it. The unknowns are how quickly will travel come back. Travel is a very high margin, low SG&A business. Food courts, it\u2019ll improve dramatically once we get tables out there everywhere, and that\u2019s not going to happen tomorrow afternoon, but it\u2019s going to happen God willing over the next several months.\nEdward Kelly: Okay. And just one last one for you on, so on the core, historically the core margin really hasn\u2019t been up, it\u2019s obviously doing very well right now going forward, I mean you could still have maybe mix benefit from things like stimulus, but don\u2019t we eventually just sort of assume that what we\u2019ve seen over the last few quarters sort of normalizes back to pre-COVID level and we take the margin down by that I mean.\nRichard Galanti: I feel a little stronger than that, in terms of the positive. I think that on the fresh side, yes. At some point, when you have your tougher year-over-your compares, you\u2019re not going to get those big basis point improvements from spoilage and labor productivity. Now some of it though, at these new levels, you have more productivity. We\u2019re not going to necessarily lose it all. But if it\u2019s a tough compare, you\u2019ll lose a little, you\u2019ll lose some of it. So yes, on some of the other categories, particularly as we increase Kirkland Signature, as we sell certain things within fresh that are specialty items, where we can get a full margin and showed even greater savings in some cases, some of the vertical integration some of the things I mentioned, like the nuts and cashews, these are all little things, but those tend to offset some of those things. I\u2019m not suggesting we\u2019re going to keep it all, but I think that we\u2019re going to do better than people are than the question as a concern about.\nEdward Kelly: Great. Thank you.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you. Well, thank you for listening. We\u2019re all here. If you have any additional questions, you know who we are. Have a good afternoon. Thank you, Blenna [ph].\nOperator: You\u2019re welcome, sir. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Galanti",
            "content": "Thank you, [Buena] [ph], and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the Company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the Company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the 12 weeks ended February 14, as well as February retail sales results for the four weeks ended this past Sunday, February 28. Reported net income for the quarter was $951 million or $2.14 per share, compared to $931 million or $2.10 per diluted share last year. This year's results included $246 million pre-tax or $0.41 per diluted share and costs incurred primarily from COVID-19 premium wages. Net sales for the quarter increased 14.7% to $43.89 billion from $38.26 billion a year ago in the second quarter. Comparable sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 were as follows. For the 12-week period U.S. comps were reported at 11.4% and excluding gas deflation and FX 12.6%. Canada reported at 13.4%, ex gas deflation and FX 10.6%. Other International reported at 21.5%, ex gas deflation and FX 17.7%. All told, total Company reported at 13.0% and ex gas deflation and FX 12.9%. E-commerce on a reported basis was 75.8% and FX 74.8%. In terms of the second quarter comp sales metrics, our traffic or shopping frequency increased 1% worldwide and up 2.7% in the U.S. on a year-over-year basis during the quarter. Our average transaction or ticket was up 11.9% total Company and 8.5% in the U.S. during the second quarter. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted sales by approximately 110 basis points and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 100 basis points. I'll review our February sales results a little bit later in the call. Going down the income statement, membership fee income came in reported at $881.5 million or 2.01%, compared to $816.4 million or 2.13% in the quarter a year ago, so up $65 million or 8%. Excluding the impact of FX, the $65 million increase would be $56 million, which would represent a 6.9% increase, excluding the impact of FX. No openings occurred in fiscal \u2013 in the second fiscal quarter both this year and last year in the fiscal quarter. In terms of renewal rates, the U.S. and Canadian renewal rate came in at as of for Q2 at 91.0% as of Q2 end. This was up 0.1% from the 90.9% at the end of the prior fiscal quarter. Worldwide our total Company renewal rates were 88.5%, as of Q2 end also up 0.1% from the prior quarter's number of 88.4%. In terms of number of members as of Q2 end, both member households and cardholders, in terms of households at Q2 end we came in at 59.7 million, up from 59.1 million 12 weeks earlier and total cardholders 108.3 million, up from 107.1 million 12 weeks earlier. As of Q2 end paid executive members were 23.8 million, an increase of 506,000 during the 12 weeks since Q1 end. Moving down the income statement to the gross margin, this year's gross margin came in at 10.96%, 2 basis points lower than last year's second quarter on a reported basis of 10.98%. Excluding gas deflation, it would have been 11 basis points lower. As I always ask you, do a little chart here to show some of the components of margin. Two columns, reported and the second column without gas deflation. First line item would be core merchandise. On a reported basis core merchandise margin year-over-year was came in at plus 71 basis points, ex gas deflation, plus 63 basis points. Second line item, ancillary businesses, minus 53 basis points and then without gas minus 55 basis points. 2% reward, minus 6 and minus 5. Other minus 14 and minus 14. So all told on a reported basis year-over-year minus 2 basis points and again ex gas deflation minus 11 basis points. So as you can see from this chart, the core merchandise component was higher ex gas deflation by 63 basis points. Similar to the last several fiscal quarters' sales penetration has shifted to the core business, resulting in higher contribution of our total gross margin dollars coming from the core operations versus a year earlier. Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation only to their own sales, core on core, if you will, margins year-over-year were higher by 71 basis points. Fresh foods was again the biggest driver here. With strong sales in fresh, we benefited from the efficiency gains and labor productivity and significantly lower spoilage. That being said, the other three major merchandise categories, food and sundries, softlines and hardlines all had higher margin percentages year-over-year in the quarter as well. Ancillary and other business gross margin was lower by 53 basis points and by 55 ex gas deflation in the quarter with most of the negative impact coming from gas and to a lesser extent from the aggregate of travel, hearing aids, pharmacy and food courts offset a little bit by a positive impact from e-com. Costco Logistics, which was our Innovel acquisition a year ago, impacted ancillary margins by 6 basis points to the negative. 2% reward, you can see was impacted negatively by 5 basis points implying that more higher penetration of our sales are coming from the executive membership group. And other is the minus 14 basis points. All of this is attributable to the cost of COVID-19 or about $60 million of the $246 million previously mentioned. These are the direct costs for incremental wages allocated to our manufacturing, production and fulfillment operations. Moving on to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the second quarter was higher or worse year-over-year by 11 basis points on a reported basis, coming in at 9.89% versus 9.78% a year earlier. The minus 11 ex gas deflation would have been a minus 3. Again, doing a little chart of comparison with two columns, both reported and then without gas deflation. First line item would be operations, plus 31, so lower or better by 31 basis points. Core operations was on a reported basis. Without gas deflation plus 38, so lower or better by 38 basis points. Central minus 3 basis points and minus 2. Stock compensation plus 3 and plus 3 and other minus 42 and minus 42. You add those columns up on a reported basis again, SG&A was higher year-over-year by 11 basis points and ex gas deflation higher by 3. The core operations component when you look at that was better by 31 or 38 excluding the impact from deflation. SG&A in the core, excluding the COVID-related expenses, which I'll discuss in a moment, was significantly leveraged with a strong core merchandise sales increases. Central, again minus 2 ex gas deflation stock comp, plus 3 both small year-over-year basis points changes together pretty much awash. And other was a minus 42 basis points hit to SG&A, which were incremental wage and benefit costs related to COVID or $186 million of that $246 million total amount. So $60 million of the $246 million hits the margin and $186 million of the $246 million hits SG&A. I'd like to take a minute here and discuss our COVID-related expenses and how they're changing effective this past Monday, March 1. Over the past 12-month period, March 2020 through February 2021 companywide we expended approximately $1.60 billion pretax on COVID-related items. Of this amount, approximately $825 million related specifically to the $2 an hour extra hourly pay. The remaining $200 million plus was made up of several other items, including the few month period where employees 65 and older were paid to stay home. This was early on during the original lockdowns, cleaning of mass supplies, paying wages to several \u2013 for several weeks to our third-party demo service employees and assisting employees with pay childcare leave which continues. With the $2 an hour extra pay having been paid in for full year that extra amount has been discontinued as of this past Sunday, February 28. And effective March 1, a few days ago, we have implemented a permanent wage increase for hourly employees as well as most salaried warehouse employees. In the U.S. and Canada, we are permanently increasing our starting wage and most wage steps above that by a $1 an hour and increasing our top of scale hourly wage by $0.45 an hour on top of the previously planned $0.55 an hour increase for top of scale. With these changes, our entry level hourly wages will increase from $15 and $15.50 an hour to $16 and $16.50 an hour. Similar type increases are occurring in other countries where we operate. With this change, along with the reduction and/or elimination of several components of the $200 million plus expenses I just discussed, on a going-forward basis this $1 billion plus expensed over the past 12 months will be reduced by a little over one-half starting March 1, which is the beginning of week three in the current fiscal third quarter. Next on the income statement is preopening expense, pretty much the same year-over-year. This year came in at $9 million compared to last year's $7 million, so $2 million higher. In both fiscal quarters there were zero openings, although this relates to upcoming openings as well. All told, reported operating income for the second quarter of 2021, including the $246 million mentioned earlier showed an increase of 5.8% coming in at $1.340 billion this year compared to $1.266 billion last year. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $40 million this year versus $34 million last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was lower by $26 million year-over-year. Interest income itself was lower by $19 million due to lower interest rates. Additionally, FX and other was lower by $7 million. Overall reported pre-tax income in the second quarter was up 3.3% coming at $1.319 billion this year compared to $1.277 billion a year earlier. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the second quarter was 26.4%, a little higher than the 25.9% recorded in Q2 of last year. For all of 2021 based on our current estimates, which of course these are always subject to change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total Company tax rate for the fiscal year to be in the 26% to 27% range. A few other items of note, in terms of warehouse expansion, as I mentioned, we \u2013 there were no openings in Q2. There were eight net new openings in Q1. So we're eight year-to-date in the second half of the fiscal year, but this quarter, in the fourth fiscal quarter we plan to open 13 more net new units. Five of those will be in the U.S., three will be in Canada and five will be in overseas. Regarding CapEx, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we spent approximately $573 million. Our full year CapEx spend is still estimated in the $3 billion to $3.2 billion range. Moving onto e-commerce, e-commerce sales overall for the quarter ex FX increased 75% year-over-year. A few of the stronger departments over the counter and pharmacy, garden and patio, small electrics, health and beauty and majors, including consumer electronics, total online grocery grew at a very strong rate in the second quarter. The comp numbers just mentioned follow our usual convention. Our usual convention, which excludes our third-party same-day grocery program, which was up 450% year-over-year in the quarter. If we include the third-party same-day in our e-com comps, the 76% reported comp number would have been 96%. Costco Logistics, formerly known as Innovel continues to fulfill a greater percentage of our delivery items and has steadily increased since its acquisition a year ago March. In Q2, we made it a priority to enhance our white club service, which includes assembly or complex installation. It's now standard on many items and offered as an upgrade on many others. Turning to COVID-19 and some of the issues and impacts surrounding it, we continued to enjoy strong core merchandise sales. I think our buying teams have done a great job keeping our building with stock despite outsized demand on some items and some supply chain challenges as well. From a supply chain perspective, overseas rate has continued to be an issue in regards to container shortage and port delays. This has caused timing delays on certain categories, including furniture, sporting goods, lawn and garden and even some food and sundries items like seafood, imported cheeses and oils. We expect these pressures to ease in the coming months, but it's impacting everyone, of course. Regarding the pressures from high consumer demand, examples of areas where we have some supply issues on the non-food side, certain electronics due to chip and component shortages like TVs, computers and smart home related items, exercise equipment, bikes and outdoor activity items, lawn and garden items and appliances. On the food side, canned beverages have some shortages due mostly to the aluminum can issue of shortages. Bacon is up 45% in pounds and so for whatever reason, there is a lot of demand there. So there is a little bit of challenges there. Gloves, surface cleaning, wipes and sanitizing sprays and some paper goods. Fresh foods overall is looking pretty good. Our three warehouse curbside pickup test in Albuquerque is ongoing. We don't really have a lot to add at this time as the test is recent and continuing. The pilot is going well. Our members have responded to it and basket size has actually surpassed our expectations. Our focus of course is how can we be more efficient in doing it and determining if this offering can become scalable and makes a firm sense for us. Turning to our February sales results, the four weeks ended this past Sunday, February 28, compared to the same period last year. As reported in our release, net sales for the month of February came in at $14.05 billion, an increase of 15.2% from $12.2 billion last year. Again, going down the numbers that were in the release. On the U.S. reported basis were up \u2013 on a same-store sale basis were up 10.3%. That's both reported and without gas and FX. Canada reported 21.6%, ex FX 15.7%. Other International 25.7%, ex FX 20.6%. Total Company 13.8% reported, ex gas and FX 12.3%. Within those numbers e-com 91.1% reported and without gas and FX 89.4%. As with the quarter these numbers \u2013 the e-com numbers would be higher if we included the third-party same-day fresh. When we discussed last year's February sales results, we pointed out that the fourth week last year had a big uptick in sales. That's kind of was the beginning of what we felt was a little bit of consumer \u2013 pressure for consumers to buy in for fear of lockdown, again primarily related to consumers buying ahead of the anticipated COVID lockdowns and closures. That positively impacted last year's February sales by approximately 3 percentage points. Similarly, sales in week four of this February, this week \u2013 week four of this year February were lower as we anniversaried that unusually strong week from a year ago. The estimated negative impact to the February month was approximately 3.5 percentage points. So the reported numbers of 13.8% and ex-gas and FX of 12.3% would have been higher excluding that impact. Our comp traffic or frequency for February was flat to last year worldwide and up 0.7% in the U.S., again some impact of that last week. Worldwide the average transaction was up 13.8%, which included positive impacts of 140 basis points from FX and 10 basis points of the gas inflation. Foreign currencies year-over-year relative to the dollar benefited February comps in Canada by 540 basis points, Other International by approximately 570 basis points and total Company by 140 basis points. Gas price inflation again positively impacted total reported comp sales by about 10 basis points, whereas the average selling price was about a percentage point higher year-over-year. In terms of regional and merchandising categories, the general highlights U.S. regions with strong results for South East, Mid West and Texas. Internationally in local currencies, we saw the strongest results in Korea, UK and Japan. Moving to merchandise highlights, the following comp sales results by category for the month and these exclude the positive impact of FX. Food and sundries were in the positive high-single digits. Departments with the strongest results were liquor, frozen foods and cooler. Hardlines were positive in the high 20%s. Better performing departments were toys and seasonal, sporting goods, hardware and majors, which again is both white goods and consumer electronics for the most part. Softlines were up \u2013 also up in the low 20%s. Better performing departments included housewares, small appliances and home furnishings. And finally, fresh foods were up in the low 20%s. Better performing departments included meat and deli. Ancillary business sales, as mentioned earlier, were down and they were down in terms of sales in the mid-single digits in February, primarily due to lower year-over-year sales in food court hearing aids and gasoline. Overall, relatively a good fiscal second quarter impacted, of course, by COVID expenses, impacted both plus and minus by various aspects of our business due to COVID and certainly as I mentioned in the ancillary, gas had the biggest of the ancillary hits. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases we will announce our March sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, April 4 on Wednesday, April 7 after the market close. With that, I will open it up to Q&A and turn it back to Lena. Well, first of all, I don't think we're doing anything dramatically -. we were going to do anything dramatically different. I mean we're already pretty aggressive on a lot of things. And of course, we're always trying to drive sales with aggressive value and pricing. Probably the one area which can be a challenge or will be a challenge at some point is fresh. The particular strength in fresh foods for the last several quarters on a year-over-year basis has been the strong fresh has led to higher labor productivity, which is part of the cost component of that if you will manufacturing businesses as well as a lower spoilage or what we call damaged and destroyed in many cases given the strength you're not throwing away as much stuff at the end of the day or a week, and you're again be much more productive from a labor efficiency standpoint. At some point, that will subside is my guess. Beyond that, we feel pretty good about our ability to be very competitive and price along that way. Well, SG&A, and then as I mentioned earlier, the COVID related premium wages the $2, that $800 plus million, a piece of that hit margin because of our manufacturing businesses, the labor involved on the manufacturing side, that's part of cost of sales. And so again, if you looked at those proportions, I think on the $246 million, we said $60 million related to margin hit and $186 million related to SG&A hit. A simple guess would be you could take that type of percentage of these numbers and apply it quarterly may be a little bit more to SG&A than that those percentages. And so, yes, if you looked at the $1.60 billion that we talked about, and we say a little over half, so simple math would suggest a little over half of that should come back. Although, we'll stop talking about COVID-related expenses too as we've now anniversaried it. I \u2013 year ago in the third quarter, we've pointed out that it helped us. But it's like it's \u2013 it is gas, it is volatile and the profitability in gas goes up and down dramatically. It's a meaningful business for us. And as prices go up, we generally make less, which has happened of late. And I think not just for us, but the supermarket chains, the other discount stores that operate chains of gas stations. And so we \u2013 again directly try to point that out each time. But there's no rhyme or reason it can change on a dime. Right. Gas is more than half of all those other things [indiscernible] certainly travel is impacted as you well know right now, probably one of - the food courts, because we're still not open with seating, essentially [indiscernible] as well. So all those are impacting, but gas is \u2013 was the prime mover there. I was looking back at last year, what we call again, what we call warehouse and other businesses, which again gas is a meaning when there are big swings, it tends to be gas is the biggest component of that. A year ago in Q1 versus a year earlier, that'd be Q1 2020 versus 2019. That number I don't have the detail on gas, but it was 19 basis points to the positive. In Q2 year-over-year, it was 2 to the negative. In Q3, it was 21 to the positive. In Q4 it was 71 to the negative. So you can see it fluctuates. This year in the first quarter, it was 22 to the negative and now 55 to the negative. And again, there's a lot of components of that number, not just gas, but gas generally tends to be the big mover there. Dollar was \u2013 well, I think it's a strong sales as a percentage of sales actually, I think you'll find it goes directionally better. I'm looking at core operations for all of fiscal 2020 versus all of fiscal 2019 on an ex gas deflation basis was lower or better by 25 basis points. Again, that's not \u2013 we separate out that below the quarterly stuff or the unusual stuff, the COVID stuff, but the core business was lower or had lower or better SG&A percent by 25 basis points for the entire year. This year in the first two quarters, it was plus 62 and plus 38. So that's on average 50. No, I think I agree with what you said about last year. This year the first three weeks were a little over a 17 and the last week brought that 17 down to our 13.8. Yes. Maybe I explained it differently each year, but yes, basically the 13.8 reported, what \u2013 for the first three weeks was a low 17 and the fourth week caused it to be a 13.8 for the whole four weeks. Well, I can't speak for others. We're frankly thrilled with our sales numbers in our and how we've done over the course of the last year. As you look at both March and our fiscal third quarter March, this giant step up in sales and traffic and hoarding, if you will, by customers started in week four of February and lasted through about 2.5 weeks into March. So we'll talk about it specifically when we report March sales, as it relates to the fiscal quarter, which is essentially mid-February to mid-May, I don't have the exact dates in front of me, but that 12-week period and included not only that tough comparison for those 3, 3.5 weeks, which included week four February and weeks, one, two, and part of three in March, but also when there was a lockdown and offset and that, and kind of late March into April and even early May, we had some very tough compares. And so that'll make it in our view, all things be equal, an easier comparison. So I think there's going to be a plus and a minus that probably add up to about even we'll see. The next challenge of course, will be Q4, which is a mid-May through the end of August. That's what we enjoyed comps in the 12% to 15% range on an ongoing basis into September, October as well. But for Q4 where we saw a lot of strengths, not only on the food side, but on the non-food side as people are buying things for the home as they weren't traveling or going to sporting events and the like. Modestly positive, yes. Yes. You are a little bit, overall I mean our gas gallons year-over-year, I think in was February the quarter and the quarter were down 9% or 10%, which is an improvement \u2013 relative improvement. And within that, in some of the regions like in the South, Texas, Florida, you've seen a little better improvement. Yes, we made a conscious effort a couple of months ago. I think even on the last quarterly call, we talked a little bit about some of the challenges with port delays both on the farm side of where the merchandise is coming from, as well as the ports along the West Coast of North America in particular and container shortages. So we were front-loading and not everything came in short. So we have frontloaded items that are not seasonal items or frontloaded extra inventory of basics. And so I'm not concerned about that at all. Well, I'd say in the last several months, we've seen a little more inflation than we had in part because of some of the container shortages, freight costs are a little higher, there's some high demand items or product shortages due to supply chain in general, that we want up. When asked on a broad stroke basis on some of these items, what type of inflation we're seeing, sometimes as much as 2% to 4%, sometimes less than that. And on meat, it's trended upward in the mid-singles, pork in the high-singles. That's why bacon, I mentioned bacon and \u2013 but we feel good about our competitive ability. We're \u2013 we always want to be the last to raise and the first to lower. And but we feel, again, as you look at our margins, we feel good about where our margins are coming in and our ability to be very competitive out there. Probably tomorrow, because I mentioned it. Yes. Thank you. Yes. Well, I think again Karen gets back to gas. Gas is a high sales dollar number and the impact to somebody put me on mute please. The impact of gas is both dollars and average price to lower gross margin as well. That's really the biggest piece of it. Well, I can just, again, without being specific \u2013 dollar specific, the biggest dollar impact year-over-year profitability of, if I \u2013 when I mentioned these various pluses and minuses was gas. And the combination in it's a 10%-ish piece of our business, which had a lower gross margin and lower dollar price per gallon. Both of those things would touch to lower sales, lower profits, and that's impacted. Well, again, travel should improve recognizing how much will reprove we'll wait to see, but its starting to improve a little bit. Food courts will improve the same thing as we start to put out seating and expand what we offer there. Now when that occurs and how that occurs, we're not \u2013 we're probably going to do it in certain regions first and go from there. Gas is the big unknown in the big guesstimate of which direction it goes each week. But we'll, again, try to point that out to you. Here, we've seen a \u2013 we have seen a period improvement in hearing aid and optical. There is a better efficiencies, although keep in mind, we've really grown this thing fast of taking our \u2013 some of our existing, not only have these departments grown dramatically in the last year. We were using third parties for a lot of it, and we continue to push more on there and to improve the service, to lower the price. And so I think you should see that should continue to improve, but it was not without its costs to accomplish all that in the last quarter. Well, I don't think we're anniversary any of them as soon. It's just starting to happen in the last month or two. And again, a lot of it has to do in our view. You've had a little bit of inflation over the last year with on things like paper goods, because of just a huge demand in the shortages. But in terms of some of the recent things with container shortages and port issues, some supply issues on chips and components of big ticket items as you know cost of Steelers up 50% to 100%. All those things impact that. I think it's more \u2013 if this has happened in the last several months versus a year ago. I can't off with the notes that I have in front of me. I mean, anecdotally, if you look at what is the cost per container coming over used to be its up 10% to 15%. Yes. Well, I think first of all, some of them are ongoing. Kirkland Signature continues to be something that will continue to increase the offerings that we do. There aren't a giant billion dollar ones, items like that. There's a handful of items like paper towels and toilet paper and water that are huge. There's the cake cups and those things that are in the hundreds of millions of dollars, but there's lots of 20s to 100s out there. And we continue to do that with all kinds of quality, organic packaged food items as well. I think one of the things that we've seen from some of our vertical integration starting to pay off, we've got the chicken facility at full capacity now. We've got a great bakery commissary, we \u2013 two years ago, we opened a second meat plant. We're seeing some improvement from that. We're also starting to identify items that historically we manufactured in one place, generally the United States, and then shipped all over the world, whether it's roasting of nuts and cashews. And yes, and doing bringing all that product from where it's grown to the U.S. for roasting and packaging and shipping out worldwide. We now have a supplier in Asia that is doing all the needs for Asia, Australia, and dramatically we're able to \u2013 or dramatically reduce the price and drive sales and drive bottom line dollars for us. We're doing that with all kinds of \u2013 we're looking at all kinds of avenues to do that with from paper goods to things like that as well. So I think these are long-term opportunities, but there should be a lot of them over the next several years. Also e-com notwithstanding, our start back in the early 2000s, we like everybody has that's become more important over the last year in particular, it's approaching 10% of our business and continue to grow nicely and we're driving \u2013 we're getting better at doing it and getting more clicks and the like, and that regard. So I think e-commerce and then the big and bulky our acquisition of Innovel last March, all you see now, and we pointed out, I think for the last three fiscal quarters, a 6 or 7 basis point hit to gross margin as it relates to the \u2013 it's like in manufacturing, it's a service business that goes ultimately back into our cost of sales, what that thing costs. Notwithstanding the fact that that has helped drive sales of big and bulky items. And in fact, lowered the prices to our members on some of those items. So we think that's as expected, it was going to be earnings dilutive at the operation standpoint for the first couple of years and be fine there, but more as importantly, if not more importantly growing big and bulky as part of our business, we're seeing big \u2013 continued big increases from mattresses to white goods to exercise equipment, notwithstanding the fact that there's been some shortages in some of those items. I don't think we'll be as extreme as the old chicken example from 15 years ago, where we stuck with continue to stay at 499 and figure out ways how to do that. But certainly, we are \u2013 we want to be the last, we want to be as sticky as possible and hold off and we'll wait until our cost has come through the system. But overall, particularly on fresh items, those prices probably change more often than not both at traditional supermarkets, as well as the Costco's world. And in fact, the other thing I want to mention is, we're a little unique in terms of our product mix. When you look at it, we're selling part of our meat business is prime. And those are the types of things where we can get a strong margin for us and show you a greater savings because the markups traditionally on something like that special item, or even higher at traditional retail outlets. So we think overall we're a good stead in that regard. We're pretty close. I mean we're at full production, which is similar. There's been some puts and tastes. We \u2013 as we built it, we decided to put in additional things that we think provide for higher quality product like air chilling and things like that. The COVID expenses certainly have impacted us more than nobody had planned for it. So that of course, should improve over the next year. I think it's \u2013 the feed costs, we've been fortunate. Historically, we've been \u2013 the first year we were fortunate feed costs are coming up a little bit, but we're also finding that the chickens are growing a little better than we thought. And so all those things add up to we feel pretty good about it. Yes. Some categories are in that 2% to 4% range and some are little, I mentioned are like meat and pork are a little higher than that, produces flat, but I \u2013 we don't do life anymore, but I think if you look at our costs on average, the view is probably flat up 1%, 1.5%, but somewhere in that range that's I guess. Sure. Well, look, what we internally call the triple plays, not only getting to become a member, but upgrade to the executive member and then to apply and get the Citi Visa card, recognizing that not everybody that applies for it gets it based on credits that's \u2013 that credit decision is made by issuing bank, not by us. And the \u2013 sorry, I lost my train of thought, but renewal rate \u2013 in terms of improving renewal rate, as we do add people to the credit card and to executive membership, both of those things tend to increase provide for more loyal customer or a high renewal rate. Also we're doing more things to get you to auto-renew whether it's on the Citi Visa card or working on some other areas right now as well, to be sent we get you to auto renew by almost a facto there's going to be a high renewal rate on those as well. First and foremost, ultimately if the things we do to make you want to remain a member of Costco, we think that some of those things like upgrading to executive membership, which we've shown you continues to be part of our quarterly positive there, as well as getting more people to auto renew. Can you hear me? Sorry. It is coming back, but it's the same thing I said back in the spring, in the summer when there was some easing of COVID statistics and people were starting to book out for Christmas and even into the winter and spring of 2021, but they did it knowing that there was generally full cancellation capabilities. We're now seeing, and as you might expect, many of those things were canceled. Now we're seeing the same thing again. We've also \u2013 travel department, we're doing pretty well, relatively speaking on car rentals. And as it relates to travel and hotel bookings, we have added some additional domestic items and Mexico items for the domestic \u2013 for the U.S. domestic market as well. Hawaii and Mexico are pretty strong. Again, within the relative framework, there is some four and five star things that we've gotten in other parts of the world, which wouldn't talk to us a few years ago, but so, we're optimistic it's going to come back and expected. And we've certainly, I think improved our offerings. There's a fast food retailer out there that has a interesting name for that. Anyway, why don't we have two more questions? Well, I'll answer the last question first. I mean we \u2013 all we knew is that week four of February compared to a year ago and weeks one and two, and part of three of March were going to be tough compares. I think we actually did a little better than we thought, but still it was a low number given the strength a year ago. And I'm sorry, what was your first question? TV market share, look at the end of the day, some of it's going to be sticky and some of it's not. We all personally hope that restaurants will reopen and we'll all be able to go out and enjoy and socialize that will impact retail food sales at Costco and supermarkets, and the likes to some extent. That being said there are other retail formats, whether it was restaurants and food that have closed for good, apparel retailers, other general merchandise retailers. So in some ways, some of the stickiness unfortunately relates to certain aspects of retail that have closed for good. And some of it will be that they've gotten more comfortable buying some of these things from the likes of Costco. I hope we lose some of it to the examples of restaurants and the like, and other stores that were impacted as they can reopen. And \u2013 but I'm sure that we will end up keeping a little bit of it as well. Whenever we sign up a member, if you look at our 90% point whatever percent renewal rate in the U.S. and Canada, that includes some 10-year plus members that are 93% or 94% or 5%, and include some members that have in the last two years, that might be mid-70%s to mid-80%s. So you're always from zero to year one to renewal, it's going to be a lower rate in year one to year two, it's a combination of two-year members plus some new one-year members picks that renewal rate up. My guess is some of these new ones again, they're going to follow that format. The other thing though, is in some cases, we think we've gotten new members sometimes in markets where we don't even operate physical stores, not a lot, but it can't hurt. Well, I think there has been a step up in the last couple of years, and it's continued this year. We are building additional fulfillment as we speak fulfillment capability. We're getting better at it, but so is everybody that's, I've seen this kind of wild growth. In some ways, we think it may be easier for us because of the fewer items. We're doing the two-day groceries still through our business centers, which works pretty smoothly. So it is a larger percentage of the $3-ish billion we spend every year than it used to be, but certainly the biggest single percentage is still opening new warehouses. In addition to physical capital expenditures, there's also IT capital expenditures, which is part of our CapEx as well. And there's a lot of investment in that around everything from e-commerce from mobile app to fulfillment in the like. From the beginning, I used to think about that question 30 years ago. And what we find is, is that we're always able to, because we've got a great employee base and that are hardworking and loyal and know that we care, we as a company are, they are cared about. I think that we feel that we've seen over the years, everything from inventory shrink to labor productivity, certainly we measure these things too, but labor productivity, and a lot of it has to do with coming up with ideas many of which are these ideas come from our employees that are on the ground, if you will working in the meat department, figuring out how to be more efficient with pounds per hour, per labor hour. So we've always figured out ways, not worried about let's figure out how to save it, and then we can give it, pass it onto them, let's pass it on and we'll get there from an efficiency standpoint. And it seems to have worked for us. Yes. Other things like, we're now have self-checkout in 60% or 70% of our 558 Costco's in the U.S. It'll be on virtually all of them. And we'll see in another countries as well. That's the savings that took us awhile to believe part of it and to figure it out, I think we're on the third format of it, the version of it, but it's working in our environment the way we want it to, and we see savings there. So we're constantly figuring those things out. And we attribute a lot of that to many of these good ideas don't come from the rooms here at the office. They come from the people out on the floor. Yes. I think it was worse last year in Q3 and \u2013 but it's been similar. It's improving a little right now, but still negative year-over-year. The big delta is as you had gas and quarters where we talked about gas was a big positive. It offset \u2013 more than offset some of these other negatives. Well, I think from simple math, we talked about the $246 million for this quarter in total for COVID-related and of that $60 million impacted margin. So $60 million over $246 million, whatever that percentage is a little under 25%. And on an annual basis, we talked about the $1.60 billion a little over half. So just take half of that. And that's kind of the net improvement or pre-tax improvement in margin from that. But there \u2013 I'm sure if there's other outliers, we'll explain them to you as we go into each quarter. Some of the things that's a easy one, because it's big and we know what we're doing with it. The unknowns are how quickly will travel come back. Travel is a very high margin, low SG&A business. Food courts, it'll improve dramatically once we get tables out there everywhere, and that's not going to happen tomorrow afternoon, but it's going to happen God willing over the next several months. I feel a little stronger than that, in terms of the positive. I think that on the fresh side, yes. At some point, when you have your tougher year-over-your compares, you're not going to get those big basis point improvements from spoilage and labor productivity. Now some of it though, at these new levels, you have more productivity. We're not going to necessarily lose it all. But if it's a tough compare, you'll lose a little, you'll lose some of it. So yes, on some of the other categories, particularly as we increase Kirkland Signature, as we sell certain things within fresh that are specialty items, where we can get a full margin and showed even greater savings in some cases, some of the vertical integration some of the things I mentioned, like the nuts and cashews, these are all little things, but those tend to offset some of those things. I'm not suggesting we're going to keep it all, but I think that we're going to do better than people are than the question as a concern about. Thank you. Well, thank you for listening. We're all here. If you have any additional questions, you know who we are. Have a good afternoon. Thank you, Blenna [ph]."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Richard Galanti. Please go ahead.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you, Cindy, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal \u2013 our fiscal year 2021, the 12 weeks ended November 22. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $1.166 billion or $2.62 per share, compared to $844 million or $1.90 per diluted share last year. This year\u2019s first quarter included tax benefits of $145 million or $0.33 per share, $0.16 of which was due to the deductibility of the $10 per share special cash dividend to the extent received by the company\u2019s received by the Company\u2019s 401(k) plan participants; and $0.17 related to stock-based compensation. Last year\u2019s first quarter included a $77 million or $0.17 per share tax benefit related to stock-based compensation, as well. And this year\u2019s results also included the cost related to our COVID-19 premium wages of $212 million pre-tax or $0.35 per diluted share. Net sales for the quarter increased 16.9% to $42.35 billion, up from $36.24 billion last year in Q1. In terms of our first quarter comp sales metrics, on a reported basis, for the U.S., we reported a 14.6% figure, excluding gas deflation and FX impacts, the 14.6% for the 12 weeks would have been 17.0% increase. Canada, for the 12 weeks reported 16.2% ex gas and FX 16.8%. Other international reported 18.7%, ex gas and FX 17.7%. So all sold for the total company we reported 15.4% comp sales increase and excluding gas deflation and FX, the 15.4% would be 17.1%. Ecommerce, on a reported basis for the 12 weeks was 86.4%, and excluding FX, 86.2%. In terms of Q1 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 5.5% worldwide and plus 7.6% in the U.S. Our average transaction size was up for the company 9.4% in the quarter year-over-year and up 6.5% in the U.S. These include the negative impacts from gas deflation and the positive impact from FX. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted sales by about 30 basis points and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 200 basis points. Going down the income statement, membership fee income came in at $860.9 million, up $57 million or 7.1%. Ex FX, it would have been up $54 million or 6.7%. During the quarter, we opened eight new units. In terms of renewal rates, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate as of the end of Q1 2021 was 90.9%, that compares to a quarter ago of 91.0% and worldwide, it was 88.4%, which was the same as it was a quarter ago. Now the U.S. and Canada rate of 90.9%, compared to the 91.0% this 0.1% decline was primarily the result of what we believe to be deferred renewals in Canada due to the pandemic. For example, traffic or frequency in our Canada warehouses in Q1 came in at a minus 1.3%, compared to a plus 7.6% figure in the United States. By the way, the U.S. renewal rate was the same at both quarters end. In terms of number of members at Q1 end, total paid households at Q1 end was 59.1 million, up from 12 weeks earlier Q4 end of 58.1 million and total cardholders at Q1 end was 107.1 million, compared to 12 weeks earlier at 105.5 million. Also at first quarter end, paid executive memberships totaled 23.3 million, an increase of 642,000 during the fiscal first quarter. On to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin in the first quarter was higher year-over-year by 50 basis points coming in at 11.55% of sales, compared to 11.05% a year ago. Excluding gas deflation, the 50 basis point increase would be 30 basis points. If you jot down two columns of numbers here to shed light on the components of gross margin, on a reported basis in Q1, 2021, the core merchandize margin year-over-year was up on a reported basis 83 basis points, plus 83. Second column, without gas deflation it would have been plus 66 basis points. Ancillary businesses, minus 15 basis points reported and minus 20, ex gas deflation. 2% reward minus 6 basis points and minus 4. Other, minus 12 and minus 12 and if you add up the two columns, on a reported basis again gross margin as reported as a percent of sales year-over-year in the quarter was up 50 basis points on a reported basis and ex gas deflation, up 30 basis points. Now the core merchandize component gross margin sales was higher 83, up 66 ex gas deflation. Similar to the last quarter, we had a sales shift from ancillary to core. This resulted in a higher contribution of our total gross margin dollars coming from the core operations versus last year. Looking at core merchandize categories in relation only to their own sales quarter-on-quarter if you will, margins year-over-year in the quarter were higher by 65 basis points. Fresh foods was again the biggest driver here with strong sales in the fresh we benefited from efficiency gains and labor productivity and significantly lower product spoilage. Food and sundries, soft lines and hard lines, the other three main core components all had higher margins year-over-year in the quarter as well. But fresh foods was the driver. Ancillary and other businesses gross margins as shown here was lower on a reported basis by 15 basis points and minus 20 ex gas deflation. Most of the impact coming from travel and to a lesser extent from gas, optical hearing aids and food courts. Costco logistics, which is our name for the acquisition of Innovel that we did several months ago impacted ancillary margins by minus six basis points, a slight relative improvement from the prior quarter year-over-year. 2% reward. Nothing surprising there. And the other in the minus 12 basis points, all of this was attributable to the costs of the COVID-19 of $53 million of the $212 million total amount previously mentioned. These are the direct costs for incremental wages allocated to our manufacturing, production and fulfillment operations. All told, even with the $53 million of COVID costs hitting the margin, Q4 year-over-year gross margin on a reported basis ex gas still up 30 basis points year-over-year. Moving to SG&A, our reported SG&A in the first quarter as a percent of sales was lower or better year-over-year by 15 basis points coming in at a 10.15% of sales, compared to a year earlier to first quarter of 10.30% and ex gas deflation, the 15 basis improvement would be 32 basis points of improvement. Again jotting down two columns of the numbers reported and without gas deflation, core operations in Q1 on a reported basis was lower or better by 49 basis points, so a plus 49, ex gas deflation of plus 62. Central, plus 1 and plus 3 basis points. Stock compensation, plus 3 and plus 4 basis points. Other, minus 38 and minus 37 basis points and summing those two columns up, total reported SG&A year-over-year was better or lower \u2013 better or plus 15 basis points and ex gas deflation, plus 32 basis points. Now, SG&A into the core, again, it shows ex deflation improvement of 62 basis points. This excludes the COVID cost which I\u2019ll talk about in a minute. There was significant \u2013 the basic significant leverage was strong core merchandize sales increases. In terms of others, the minus 38 or minus 37 basis point number ex deflation \u2013 gas deflation. These are incremental costs from the COVID-19 or $159 million of the $212 million total number that we had mentioned earlier. The premium wages have been extended through January 3rd at this time. Again, even including these $159 million of COVID-related premium pay expenses, SG&A year-over-year improved nicely. Next on the income statement is preopening expense, $22 million this year in the first quarter, compared to $14 million a year earlier. We had ten openings, eight net of two relocations during the quarter and four openings gross, three net of one relocation a year earlier. Last year\u2019s $14 million number did included a couple million dollars related to preopening on our new poultry \u2013 on our poultry complex, which was opened and went into business right before the beginning of Q1. All told, reported operating income for Q1 2021 increased 35%, coming in at $1.43 billion this year compared to $1.061 billion last year and even a higher percent increase of course, it would have been higher now we had those - the premium pay. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $39 million this year versus $38 million last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was lower by $6 million year-over-year. Interest income itself within interest income and other was lower by $22 million year-over-year, due in large part to lower interest rates, offset by FX and other which was up \u2013 was higher or better by $16 million year-over-year. So, overall, reported pretax income in Q1 2021 was up 34% coming in at $1.42 billion this year, compared to $1.058 billion a year earlier. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was 16.8%, compared to 19.1% in Q1 last year. Both year\u2019s tax rates benefited from the tax treatment of stock-based compensation as mentioned earlier. This year\u2019s tax rate in the first quarter also benefited from the tax deductibility of the special dividend payable to Company\u2019s 401(k) participants as discussed, that portion payable to the 401(k) plan participants as discussed earlier in the call. This year\u2019s full \u2013 this full year\u2019s - fiscal year\u2019s effective tax rate, excluding these discrete items is currently projected to be between 26% and 26.5%. In terms of warehouse expansion, as I mentioned in the first quarter of this fiscal year, we opened eight net new units. Our plan for the year is somewhere in the 20% to 22% range. None in the second quarter and 5 or 6 in Q3 and 7 or 8 in Q4. As of Q1 end, total warehouse square footage stood at 117 million square feet. In terms of capital expenditures, in the first quarter of 2021, we spent approximately $893 million. Our full year CapEx spend for fiscal 2021 is still estimated to be in the $3 billion to $3.2 billion range. In terms of ecommerce, overall, our ecommerce sales in Q1 ex FX increased at 86.2% year-over-year. A few of the stronger departments, food and sundries, housewares, pharmacy, OTC and health and beauty aids, small electrics and TVs and other electronics. Total online grocery grew at a very strong rate in Q1, nearly 300%. This comp numbers that I mentioned the 86.2% figure follow our usual convention which excludes these third-party same day grocery program as they come in themselves and shop in our warehouses and then delivered to our members. If we include the third-party same day in our e-commerce comps, the 86.2% result would have been just over 100% . Innovel, now rebranded as Costco Logistics continues to grow and we continue to push more big and bulky items to the site. We\u2019ve added - in the past quarter, we added an Instacart scheduler this quarter where members can select specific delivery dates for most big and bulky items and made improvements to our call center with specifically trained agents, as well. That continues to grow nicely. And lastly, a couple of fun sports items just loaded two days ago. We have a Babe Ruth Autographed Baseball for $64,000 and a Ty Cobb Autographed Louisville Slugger Bat for $160,000. We\u2019ve also recently sold a number of memberships for Wheels Up, a private jet service operator. Now turning to COVID and some of the issues and impacts surrounding it. From a sales perspective, similar to our strong sales results this past summer in our fiscal fourth quarter, we have continued to enjoy strong sales results during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We continue to generate strong sales in food and sundries and health and beauty aids and fresh foods and alike, and we\u2019ve also benefited from improved sales and products and items for the home as people are spending less on air and travel and hotel and dining, now they seem to have redirected some of those dollars to categories like electronics, furniture and mattresses, exercise equipment, housewares, cookware, domestics, et cetera. And as mentioned earlier, sales in most of our ancillary businesses were slower year-over-year in the quarter, travel, gas, hearing aids and food courts. From a supply chain perspective, 40,000 foot view if you will. Most factories are up and running at our suppliers and in many cases, production capacity has been increased. However, even higher increases in demand of some products are still creating some supply issues. There are instances of 50%, 100% or even more sales increases of an item and if we can procure more, we\u2019ve had even higher sales. Examples would include things like, exercise equipments, certain major appliances, certain electronics items, as well as certain housewares and small electric items. On the transportation front, there have been some container shortages at origin, as well as some congestion at destination ports here in the states. The latter typically two to four days, but a little longer in some cases. We are managing through it and expect relief not until March or so of 2021, as well, the past few weeks there have been some challenges that you may have read about in the industry in terms of delayed delivery times of items just given the number of items being shipped now through third-party carriers. While this may be due to some sales of members are not confident in timely holiday delivery, we, like others, I am sure have done a couple of things. We\u2019ve adjusted our stated expected delivery times on our side and reminded people to shop early. And in our case, we took several hundred non-food items, non-food online items that are also in line and they are providing same day delivery fill-ins to card including items like air pods and insta pods, laptops and many over-the-counter and health and beauty aid items, as well as some other home essentials. In terms of food and sundries, continued limits on some paper goods. Demand in sales went up as COVID began spiking again. A toughest area is, Nitrile gloves, surface cleaning wipes and sanitizing sprays, also in some cases, some paper goods. Overall, dairy items are in good shape, as well as proteins and produce on the fresh side. In terms of our holiday merchandize planning and results, Halloween, we went into a little more conservative in terms of costumes and Halloween-specific candy items. We came out of Halloween with pretty clean inventory levels. Christmas, as I think I mentioned on the last earnings call responding to a question, we went a little more basic in terms of needs and uses for the house. So very strongly we\u2019ve gone into it with fundamental items for the home like housewares, TVs, electronics, even added items like barbeques and pressure washers and furniture items. A little less, we had cut back a little been on seasonal items like holiday decorations and gift wrap and some of the candy and food/gift baskets. In some instances, we already sold through those inventories. Our warehouses overall have remained open and are mostly back to regular hours with an additional hour on any morning for seniors and persons with disabilities. Warehouses are still following social distancing and sanitation guidelines and in some jurisdiction, we have to limit occupancy. Since May 4th, as you may recall, we\u2019ve required members and employees in the warehouses to wear masks and since November, 16th, we\u2019ve required facials for those unable to wear a mask. And some of these initiatives of course will extend well into Q2 of this fiscal year. Finally, in terms of upcoming press releases, we will announce our December sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, January 3rd, on Wednesday, January 6th after market closes. With that, I will open it up to questions and answers and I\u2019ll turn it back to Cindy. Cindy?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nSimeon Gutman : Hey everyone. Good afternoon. Richard, I wanted to ask following on you talked about some of the merchandizing plans around Halloween and Christmas. You are going to begin to lap some pretty massive surges in growth when you get into 2021. I know you don\u2019t guide, but you are probably planning inventory purchases. So I wanted to ask how you sort of manage with a pretty wide range of outcomes? And I don\u2019t know if you have any guidepost thinking about some of the gains you are making in fresh food as far as the spoilage and the markdowns that don\u2019t seem to be happening. So how do you think \u2013 how do you plan for lapping some of those as well?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I mean, there is a few different things and time periods that will be and questioned. If we recall, there was a big surge in frequency and sales results. The last week in February, and the first two or three weeks of March, when people were coming in and hoarding in our view, and of course, we were running out of everything basics from water to paper goods, to cleaning supplies and things like that. And in some cases, and then beyond that into April, May, there were some issues as there were some COVID spiking at many fresh plants \u2013 protein plants meat and poultry and alike. And so, it\u2019s hard to project completely. I think I started of late, we have tried to build a little extra inventory where we can and some of the key things that aren\u2019t going to go out of style like paper goods and cleaning supplies. Although then you get to next rush of spiking and whenever extra inventory you had it goes away pretty quickly. Look, we\u2019ll continue to work around it. We work \u2013 and in some cases, it\u2019s a little easier in a sense that we have fewer suppliers to deal with or fewer items to deal with. Arguably, in other cases, given our huge volumes that creates its own challenges sometimes. I think the bigger challenge is going to be post May last year and this past year, when we saw kind of sales strength not just in those key essential categories like fresh foods and foods and sundries, and paper goods and health and beauty aids, but also on the non-food side, items for the home if you will and those types of basic items. And again, people spending some of those dollars. Look, some things will improve and some things may be degraded a little bit. Some things that are degraded may take a while and not everything is going to happen unlike what was not going up one day and everything is going to get better from a food standpoint in terms of restaurants being opened. And so, I think, we are in it together and we feel pretty good that we\u2019ve got a good format to serve our members well and we\u2019ll go from there.\nSimeon Gutman : And as far as, I don\u2019t know, events, I know, road shows, I don\u2019t know how prevalent they\u2019ve been. Your mailers, are there things that you can change the cadence of either to get more aggressive? Grocery, you\u2019ve taken a huge amount of share this year. Is that an area you are going to lean into stronger? Just curious how are thinking about the merchants are prepping for the upcoming year?\nRichard Galanti: Well, as it relates to promotional forms that we do like the mailers or even online type of mailers, these are some of those have been changed because some of the big ticket non-food \u2013 not big ticket, I am sorry. Some of the big size items that are always in there like paper goods, like cleaning supplies, in some cases we\u2019ve had to eliminate some of those items from the mailer. We put other items in. In some cases, it\u2019s done fine and in some cases, it\u2019s a little bit less of a sales increase. But that\u2019s not just going forward, that\u2019s been in the last few months as well that we\u2019ve changed those things. I think we\u2019ve been pretty good at pivoting and adding new items. I think the examples of \u2013 for Christmas, while we may have \u2013 maybe and went a little too deep into cutting back, not they were big cuts, but we are running out of some of those decorative things we could do earlier and we would have like to. We also though found success in lots of essential, basic fundamental items. I don\u2019t think \u2013 I mean, the first Christmas, we probably brought in barbeque grills and pressure washers to market. And they are doing well, because people are buying gifts for the home.\nSimeon Gutman : Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Mr. Mike Baker of D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.\nMike Baker : Hi. Thanks. I was little curious on the holiday trends. Two questions really. One by chance advertising get customers to spread out their sales to come in a little bit early, do you think there is any pull forward of holiday sales into November from December? And then a second part of the holiday question, I think you said that you are out of stock quickly in some of these seasonal items. Do you think you could have made a little bit more aggressive on the seasonal stuff? How much you think your sales could have been up if you had done that?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Well, first of all, talking to the buyers, they definitely feel that some of the merchandize and sales were pulled forward into November, not only from December, but even the week of November and there has been articles out there about Thanksgiving and overall, not Costco-specific, but just in general about what\u2019s going on online and what have you. And so, certainly some of that kind of got push forward. In terms of some things, I mean there are examples where instead of buying 10% more this year of a given item, we bought 10% or 20% less. So, we still bought a lot. We just not like we cut our order back by half. But in retrospect, we probably could have sold a little bit more. I don\u2019t have a dollar number. It\u2019s probably not that meaningful. For every negative there is another positive. Needless to our say, our comps overall have been very strong.\nMike Baker : Yes. That\u2019s fair. And if I could add \u2013 ask one more, I guess, unrelated question. The MFI, the 7.1% increase, that\u2019s better than it has been. A nice acceleration there. Any color as to where that acceleration came from more in the 4%, 5% range got last few quarters?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think, in terms of shopping frequency?\nMike Baker : No, membership fee income.\nRichard Galanti: No.\nMike Baker : Correct.\nRichard Galanti: Oh, I am sorry. Okay. I didn\u2019t hear the first part of the question. Well, I think we opened a few more units than we did a year earlier. Without looking that deeply, that\u2019s probably most of it.\nMike Baker : Okay. Fair enough. I appreciate the color.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett. Your line is now open.\nChuck Grom : Hey, thanks. Hey, good afternoon, Richard. In your online offering, can you remind us where it stands in terms of total mix of business and also level of profitability relative to the store? And looking ahead, what categories you may start going into more?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s sort of in-store of course, and warehouse, we\u2019ve got about 3800 active items. Online, we typically got somewhere in the high single digit thousands, I mean, call it, 9,000 plus. I am sorry, and in terms of sales, it\u2019s about 7% of sales. Now we don\u2019t include in that number as I mentioned like the third party sales like the Instacart Same Day Fresh , because their employee or a contracted employee is coming into Costco shopping just like any other customer coming to shop. So that you could add a little bit more to that. But in terms of what we call online, it\u2019s about 7%. I think it was 6% in fiscal 20 for the entirety, and of course, it was half way through the year when you saw ecom percentages increases jump dramatically with the advent of COVID.\nChuck Grom : And then, talk about core profitability.\nRichard Galanti: Overall, ecommerce a little less profitable. You\u2019ve got category-wise, it\u2019s profitable. You\u2019ve got \u2013 category-wise, you\u2019ve got merchandize categories that don\u2019t include some of the highest gross margin components of our business like fresh, like apparel in a big way in terms of the penetration. You\u2019ve got electronics which is a lower than average margin business both in-store and online and so much bigger percentage of penetration online, so they are examples. Certainly, the profitability of ecommerce has been helped with the types of comp sales increases we\u2019ve had over the past year. But also over this past year, there is some of the cost inefficiencies of growing it so fast. We \u2013 in terms of fulfillment, as we are continually adding locations where to shift out of and getting closer to the customer as this overall size of the business has grown a lot. And as I mentioned earlier, the investment in Innovel, recall, we are calling Costco Logistics, that was a \u2013 as we expected a hit year-over-year to the margin simply because it\u2019s being ramped up and upgrading it.\nChuck Grom : Gotcha. And then, just a follow-up on next question and I pardon my near-term orientation of it. But when you look at the comp in November and the fall-off at the end of the month, albeit, it\u2019s still strong, just when you look back if there is any learnings on to why you think sales fell off. And then curious if the revenue trends have started to bounce back.\nRichard Galanti: I think it\u2019s \u2013 I mean, our best guess is, it\u2019s complete pull-forward. I mean, the fact is, is people marketing bigger ticket items and some of those types of holiday items earlier in November.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Last Friday, it was promotions and for the whole month.\nRichard Galanti: Yes, Bob, here mentioned that, Black Friday promotions this year. More of those things we promoted earlier in the month. And not an assessment everybody else out there too.\nChuck Grom : Gotcha. All right. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Mr. Michael Lasser of UBS.\nMichael Lasser : Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Nice holiday gifts and some people on this call might be considering getting for loved ones this season. When you look at your sales, compared to the rest of the consumables retail entity, most others are seeing a deceleration in their comps, whereas Costco is seeing an acceleration in its comps. Why do you think that is? Is it\u2019s simply because customers \u2013 members are coming into buy their discretionary goods and moving up their baskets which is the consumable items?\nRichard Galanti: We definitely think that, look, being essential in recognizing the people clearly are coming in to buy food and cleaning items and health and beauty aids and alike. That gets you in the door. And certainly in our view, given that money is being spent on other things in normal years perhaps is being spent more for things for the home. We have that as well and I think that has helped us in that regard.\nMichael Lasser : Okay. So, it really comes down to mix and the Costco results to helping that to really consider.\nRichard Galanti: I buy it. I\u2019d like to think part of it is people feel hopefully, at least relatively safe coming into a big wide open box environment where we\u2019ve done and we think a pretty good job of social distancing and other safety protocols.\nMichael Lasser : Okay. And the \u201cgross margin increases\u201d it seems like it\u2019s a function of just the strong sales allowing Costco to be able to sell through better than it might. Why is it been able to? Is that right that we should it should have posted \u2026\nRichard Galanti: Yes. I think most of it is strong sales which shows its brightest colors with fresh food where you\u2019ve got two cross components that have improved dramatically, spoilage and labor productivity. So, that has certainly helped.\nMichael Lasser : One other thought on it, like it seems \u2013 sorry.\nRichard Galanti: Oh, less promotion. The other, Michael is, I think you\u2019ve all read about this from an industry perspective. There has been less promotional activities out there. While we were still getting great values on things, when you look at TVs in general, well, prices have come down across the board just because they always do over time. And these seem to be getting better, bigger and less expensive. There is not the kind of promotional money being thrown at it by the manufacturers because they haven\u2019t had to. And so, I think that too has had some impact.\nMichael Lasser : That\u2019s helpful. I hope you have a great holiday. Thank you.\nRichard Galanti: You as well.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Scot from RBC Capital Markets.\nScot Ciccarelli : No, the attempt there. Hi guys. Scot Ciccarelli. So, I believe some of the products you guys sell via your website or ecommerce are for members only, but not all of them, or it doesn\u2019t look like that from a \u2013 perspective . So, assuming it\u2019s not just a \u2013 difference, how much of your ecommerce sales are coming from members?\nRichard Galanti: Virtually all. I believe part of the challenges is on some items as we work with our suppliers and ourselves as well. We want you to be able to have sign in to see the prices.\nScot Ciccarelli : I got it. Okay. And then, Richard, what\u2019s the update today regarding how much of your ecommerce sales are being drop shipped from vendors versus kind of delivered through Costco?\nRichard Galanti: About 50-50. A little less than 50 is being drop shipped.\nScot Ciccarelli : Got it. All right. Appreciate it. Happy holidays.\nRichard Galanti: Same to you.\nOperator: And next question from Karen Short with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nKaren Short : Hey. Thanks very much. A couple questions I wanted to ask. So, first just on COVID and wages. So, the 212 you called out obviously gave us a breakout on the impact on cost of goods versus SG&A. But that was a little higher than the number, I think the $14 per week that you\u2019ve guided. So, wondering if that\u2019s \u2013 what the delta would have been, because that would have gotten us to about $168 million. And then, wondering if you can give a little color on what the \u2013 like other cleaning component might be would have been in this quarter and then how to think about it in to next quarter, because presumably, does \u2013 like I asked last quarter, that January 3rd date is probably not the undate I would assume.\nRichard Galanti: Well, we\u2019ll find out. Needless to say I can\u2019t comment on that, but a big chunk of the difference of 14 I may have round \u2013 honestly down to 14 and now it\u2019s rounding up to whatever. But at the end of the day, there is more hours is the biggest delta. More cumulative hours.\nKaren Short : Okay.\nRichard Galanti: We have the\u2026\nKaren Short : And then the cleaning component.\nRichard Galanti: That\u2019s relatively small.\nKaren Short : Okay. And then, I am wondering if you could give a little color on the expansion of the Instacart relationship. You obviously listed a couple of SKUs that you\u2019ve added on to that with respect to the third-party. Can you give a color on what the markup is on non-shoot items versus shoot and then give a breakdown on what that would be for members versus non-members on the markup?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I can\u2019t be that specific. We continue over the last three or four years, we\u2019ve continued to work to lower the effective average markup across the board on items. There is some discretion on some to be lower than them and some to be higher but there is an average, which includes both their markup, plus whatever other fees that person is spending here, whether it\u2019s a per delivery fee or per monthly fee or per monthly fee to Instacart. As given some of the unique issues during the end of the year with the high demand for shipping, and the capacity issues out there with the third-party shippers we \u2013 given that Instacart is always coming in, we\u2019ve added some items to the tray. In some cases, there is a maximum markup on those that is \u2013 in many cases, smaller than that \u2013 quite a bit smaller than that on that mid to high teen number percentage-wise.\nKaren Short : Okay. And then just last question. In terms of MFI, obviously, the \u2013 I think, January of 2021 would be the new timeline in terms of the tax deductibility in California. Is there any thoughts in terms of the timeline, in terms of how you would think about. And then, your membership fee increase, because I think in the past you\u2019ve historically done that when you\u2019ve actually seen counter intuitively traffic slowing and it seems like you may be looking at slower traffic to space on tough compares as we get into parts of next year. So, that\u2019s great color on them.\nRichard Galanti: Well, I mean, historically as you know for 35 years, we\u2019ve effectively raised the basic fee $5 every roughly five years and I say roughly it could be 5, 5.5 years. And the executive membership has been raised to originally started at 100 and now it\u2019s 110 then 120. The last time we did the increase was I believe was in June-ish of 2016. So five years \u2013 it\u2019s June 2016. But it was June of one of the years either 2016 or 2017, but it will be five years from then that we might look. You mentioned that, we\u2019ve done it when things are \u2013 sales have been stronger and when sales have been weaker, when the economies get to hit or whatever else. We look at it and somewhat it dependently at that. We look at it and we feel heavily improved the value of the membership by more than that five or respective $5 or $10. And I am not suggesting we might wait or not, but time will tell. Historically, we\u2019ve always thought very good about when we\u2019ve done it and certainly the value proposition has been enhanced much \u2013 at a much greater multiple than the $5 or $10.\nKaren Short : Thanks. Have a great holiday.\nRichard Galanti: Thanks. You too.\nOperator: Your next question is from Oliver Chen of Cowen.\nOliver Chen : Hi. Thank you very much. Hi, Richard. Regarding what\u2019s ahead with vaccinations, do you see a role that your pharmacy will play in that and also in this dynamic environment, how are you thinking about managing inventory versus sales as we look forward to hopefully a pathway to vaccination, et cetera. Thank you.\nRichard Galanti: I believe there \u2013 we and the country are in the first phase of the vaccination process. We are not participating in that. But I believe Phase 2 which will be just a short period down the road. Our pharmacies will also be part of the many pharmacies throughout the country that are going to be providing the service of vaccinations for them. We are in Phase 1 in the State of Alaska only currently. But I think throughout our country we plan to be in Phase 2 which will be the big push after this first initial round. And in terms of managing inventories, while space is not infinite, certainly the cost of carrying extra inventory isn\u2019t very expensive right now, given very low interest rates. But at the end of the day, as I mentioned, it\u2019s little earlier, we \u2013 I think we plan positively in terms of how our sales have been and to the extent of the example of those seasonal items, we keep down a little bit. But not a lot. And I think we\u2019ll continue to do that kind of planning. A lot of times on items that are short, but there is certainly no risk of having the only risk of having is some extra paper towels for a few weeks is the risk of having them. There is not any obsolescence or markdown risk on it. We always tried in times when there is more of that available, we\u2019ll build up a few extra weeks of supply. But overall, I don\u2019t see a big change in our inventory turns or payable cycles.\nOliver Chen : Okay. Ecommerce \u2026\nRichard Galanti: I can say that more by comp sales than anything. When we were enjoying a pre-COVID a 6% to 8% comp sales number, inventories as a percent of \u2013 payables as a percent of inventories was whatever the number was. When we saw the big increase in comps, you saw the payables as a percent of inventories going up.\nOliver Chen : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And on the topic of ecommerce, as we think about longer term growth rates as well as new customer acquisition that you are seeing an engagement online, what are some of the major catalysts for innovation going forward that you will implement or that you are looking to implement? And then, how do you think growth rates may evolve as hopefully reopening occur eventually?\nRichard Galanti: Well, look, we even today want things to get back to normal from a business standpoint and also most importantly from a personal standpoint. And over the next couple of years, god willing, starting with this process of vaccinations and vaccines and hopefully a big chunk of this progress through by the beginning or during the summer people will get out more and will be going back to restaurants and alike and will that have an impact on our food sales? Of course, it will. So, some of this positive will be sticky. Some of the new members will be sticky and we\u2019ll go from there. I think that, there are lots of attributes to value and customer loyalty, certainly, the best prices on great quality merchandize that the member trusts in our view is the biggest attribute. And that\u2019s where we start from. We \u2013 ecommerce is certainly \u2013 and the acquisition of Innovel in terms of big ticket items and having a great service and a great value for those items we think helps us. But ultimately, we still want our members to come into the warehouse. When they come in, they see the items and they are more likely to buy some of those items and certainly, driving them with great value and great quality is what we are all about.\nOliver Chen : That\u2019s helpful. And last, on that logistics, Costco Logistics part, what should we know about as we model that going forward in terms of the margin headwinds and the dimensions around the size of that business relative to total? Thanks.\nRichard Galanti: Well, the only two data points we\u2019ve given you is in Q4, year-over-year it was about, I think an eight basis point margin hit and in Q1 which we just reported for this new fiscal year was a six basis point margin hit. As guessing games go, assume that there will be constant improvement in that over the next several quarters. So that it won\u2019t be a negative. That doesn\u2019t include any benefit we get from increased sales of those items and the margin associated with that. But when we bought this we knew that they would be dilutive from an earnings standpoint for the \u2013 certainly in the first year and perhaps into the second year hopefully on a decreasing basis and certainly in the first two quarters it would indicate a little of that. But at the end of the day, we think it \u2013 those companies that have had their own infrastructure to be able to do last mile delivery and installations, it\u2019s a positive certainly the home improvement companies have done that and the retailers and it worked out for us and we are excited about what we can do with it.\nOliver Chen : Thank you very much. Happy holidays. Best regards.\nRichard Galanti: Same to you.\nOperator: Your next question from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nEdward Kelly: Yes. Hi, Richard. Good afternoon. You mentioned freight. I was hoping you could provide just a little more color on the headwind and then you talked about an improvement maybe coming in March. Any more color behind that?\nRichard Galanti: Not really. Before each call, I\u2019ll sit down with the Head of Merchandizing and some of the other senior people in merchandizing and just get the color on their departments and what\u2019s going on. And it was a by the way comment that, with things coming from Asia as an example, or in general, there is container shortages. And so, we may take a few extra days to get things on to ship. Or the ship may its sailing not full in some cases. The same thing is on some of the big ports in the United States like on the West Coast particularly. They\u2019ve mentioned two to four days of delay. Again, two day for us is not a lot but when you are moving inventory fast, you want to have it \u2013 once it\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019ve ordered it, you want to it go to put on the ship and get here in on to our floor. So, it\u2019s not a big deal and the comment was, I said what will improve and said probably not until February, March. So, I just \u2013 that\u2019s what I threw out. Not any more impacts from that.\nEdward Kelly: Okay. And then, I just had a question on ecom and just digital strategy generally. Any updated thoughts on buy online pick up at store. I mean, you had essentially kind of become a standard offering across the industry and we probably see accelerated a lot of digital adoption. Just curious as to whether you are rethinking that at all.\nRichard Galanti: We are not rethinking it. We continue to look at it and scratch our heads a little bit. But at this juncture we don\u2019t have any current plan to do so.\nEdward Kelly: Okay. And then just lastly for you, fuel, I think gross profit per gallon this quarter was probably up quite a bit. I mean, look at the OPEC\u2019s data it looks like maybe double. Is that about right and then what the gallon sold do this quarter?\nRichard Galanti: We don\u2019t \u2013 the gallons sold were down \u2013 not down as much as they have been and it\u2019s troughed a few months ago and you are right, on margins, that not a double. I can\u2019t give you any quantitative number there. But in terms of margins were up year-over-year as a percent and gallons were down year-over-year.\nEdward Kelly: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan.\nChris Horvers : Thanks good evening. So, wanted to follow-up on the holiday pull-forward question. I was curious the merchants are thinking about how the season progresses, particularly as we get close to Christmas, some retailers think that given the earlier cut-off time to get the guess in time for Christmas that there could be a big brick and mortar surge. I think other retailers are saying that no what you seen all started like with prime day and it\u2019s just been a pull-forward. So don\u2019t expect anything out of the \u2013 anything unusual close to Christmas too. So, curious what your merchants are thinking.\nRichard Galanti: Well, merchants are feeling pretty \u2013 I would say, aggressive with this. They feel that, again, some of it was pull-forward. But there is still \u2013 and again, running out of some gift wrapping paper two weeks before you wanted to is not the end of the world. But every sale is a sale that we want. And the same token bringing in fundamental items that if you end up having a few extra SKUs or few extra quantity of certain SKUs the day after Christmas is not going to kill you because it\u2019s not stuff that\u2019s seasonal that has to be marked down in a big way. So, I think that, we can lean it to it recognizing that our sales overall particularly brick and mortar have done well. That we are basing our assumptions on what we are going to do I think over the next two weeks, positive relative to this. Recognizing there could be some pull-forward and it will be some because of the dates got a little longer on shipping. But at the end of the day, we see that \u2013 we are always with you. That should help the in-store experience and we\u2019ll see.\nChris Horvers : Got it. And then, in terms of the \u2013 you called out travel and gross margin as a big impact there. Is there something around the counting of that? You haven\u2019t called out prior, maybe it was just because it\u2019s irrelative to other things and the ancillary business. But is there an accounting thing. Is there seasonality to that and would we expect that to sort of get worse for some reason?\nRichard Galanti: What we can \u2013 like you to do is just like in a 10-K, you got to put the \u2013 you got to rank them in order of dollars. So, in the case of travel, first of all it\u2019s a very high gross margin business. To the extent that we are simply acting as a broker like our car rentals, there is sales and no coast of sales equals gross margin or very little cost of sales. Only when we curate an item and take ownership of it, you will like hundred crew ship weeks or whatever I am making this example up, where you sell $100,000 or something and make a few thousand dollars or $5,000 of margin. That\u2019s a 5%. But you have big chunks of that business that are 80 plus percent margin. So, it\u2019s a business that started to show a little bit of life as we ended December. But with the spiking of COVID in the last several weeks that has dissipated quite a bit. And even some of the life that occurred in the summer were bookings out as for Christmas some of those are being cancelled as you would expect them to be. So, it\u2019s that \u2013 it\u2019s the rank order of them which one hit harder a little bit.\nChris Horvers : Got it. And then, the last question is, on price gaps relative to peers and club and grocery, how are you \u2013 what \u2013 have they widened? Where do you see them now? I think if you go back to this 2009 timeframe, where sort of lap peak food at home inflation and you lap some food at home wallet gains. You seem to get more aggressive on price. So, just want to get your thoughts on where you see the price gaps now and how you are thinking about that into 2021?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I mean, we look at our comp shops compared to warehouse, clubs as well as comps specifically on certain items and at their traditional retail formats, we feel very good about our competitive mote if you will. And we don\u2019t think that\u2019s an issue at all for us right now. But we are the ones that keep pushing and pushing the limits further.\nChris Horvers : Got it. Have a great season guys. Thanks.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you.\nOperator: And next question from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse.\nRobert Moskow : Thanks for the question. Richard, you mentioned that manufacturers, I guess, goods \u2013 they are not promoting as much, not giving as many discount as usual because they don\u2019t have to. Any point you think that could slip the other way? And if so, what would drive it? Is it the body of supply or maybe a more intense competitive environment?\nRichard Galanti: Gosh! When I find out, I\u2019ll let you know. I mean, what\u2019s happened of course with everything in the strength \u2013 both the strength in electronic items, TVs, air pods and everything else of between and laptops and the demand for those things is enormous and in some cases, some shortages of supplies in general even if capacity has gone up it\u2019s going to overlap more. So, and it\u2019s hard to say.\nRobert Moskow : Okay. I was thinking more on the lines of package crude, we\u2019ve heard some categories putting promotions back in. Do you have any insight into that?\nRichard Galanti: I don\u2019t. I am sorry.\nRobert Moskow : Okay. Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: And next question Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.\nGreg Melich : Richard, hi. Hey, it\u2019s Greg Melich. I think that was me. So, I am showing two questions. One, was there any grocery inflation showing up and we see CPI for growth picking up and there is less promotion. What are you guys seeing there?\nRichard Galanti: Very, very, very little.\nGreg Melich : So that\u2019s something but it\u2019s nothing like 4%, 5%, some of those other numbers we see out there.\nRichard Galanti: Oh, it\u2019s not even 8%. It\u2019s very, very, very low. Three verys. Triple verys.\nGreg Melich : On cash, the special dividend, congratulations and keeping it special and getting it done. You should be back a little under $10 billion of cash. What\u2019s the right number that you want to run the business with either still during COVID or even on the others side of it.\nRichard Galanti: Well, keep in mind that there is a chunk of it that is weekend debit and credit card receivables that could be $1 billion or $1.5 billion. There is upwards of just under $1 billion that is related to insurance captives and alike. There is a $2 billion to $3 billion that\u2019s overseas and different countries which for whatever reasons is the last whether you want to bring back because of whatever withholding your other taxes related to it. So, at the end of the day, someone asked the question after we announced the $10 dividend we could have done more. The answer is we could have but why rush? I mean, right now, we still don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with COVID and what may happen next year in the economy. And so, we\u2019ll probably have a little more cash than normal \u2013 than pre-COVID if you will. But that\u2019s okay too.\nGreg Melich : And then, last, could you just \u2013 what are average rates today? The sort of levels that or the \u2013 we know the COVID up, thanks for that helping us there. But where are we now before all that?\nRichard Galanti: You mean, the average U.S. hourly wage? .\nGreg Melich : Yes.\nRichard Galanti: I think we are in the \u2013 well, ex the $2 we are either right above or just approaching $24 average in the U.S.\nGreg Melich : Excellent. $24 in the U.S. And so, the \u2013 and the changes for the base rates going up, that was \u2013 you did that, that was completed when?\nRichard Galanti: In March I believe, last year.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Last March,\nRichard Galanti: Last March. Beginning of March. March of 2019. I believe it was at the beginning of March. Whatever that Monday start for that weekly pay period was or bi-weekly period was. And that was $2 across the board.\nGreg Melich : Right. And the COVID stuff on top of that.\nRichard Galanti: Excuse me.\nGreg Melich \\: The COVID that was on top of the actual wage rate.\nRichard Galanti: Yes.\nGreg Melich \\: Right. Got it. Great. Well, good luck. Have a great holiday.\nRichard Galanti: Thanks, you too.\nOperator: And next question from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nRupesh Parikh : Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. So, I wanted to ask about just some of the countries where you have lower COVID infections, China, Australia seems to be normalizing now. How is purchasing behavior in those markets return back to \u2013 whether maybe pre-pandemic. I am guessing, Australia is probably a better read than China?\nRichard Galanti: They both have stronger comps.\nRupesh Parikh : From a carry forward perspective, have you seen the carry forward shift to I guess, maybe where they were pre-pandemic if you look at the mix?\nRichard Galanti: Well. I don\u2019t have that detail in front of me unfortunately. And when I look at comps by country, in local currencies, we are - in most countries we are back to normal, if not a little better.\nRupesh Parikh : Okay. Okay, great. And then, just in the U.S. just given we seen spikes in infections and California has had more restrictions recently put in place. I was curious if you can just comment on anything you are seeing more recently in terms of the changes in consumer behavior or traffic to your stores?\nRichard Galanti: The only thing that I\u2019ve noted is, is that when it first started a few weeks ago, or when \u2013 the California, everyone there was waiting for - in California, everybody was waiting to hear what the new restrictions was going to be in terms of lockdowns. There was a spike in shopping and people were coming in. So, we had particular strength over a couple of week period when more spiking was accruing.\nRupesh Parikh : Okay, great. Thank you. Have a great holiday.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you. You too. Why don\u2019t we take two more questions? We will take two more questions, Cindy.\nOperator: Okay. Your next question is from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital.\nKelly Bania : Great. Thanks for fitting me in here. Richard, just wanted to back to the buy online and pickup at store question. I know you\u2019ve said for several quarters, now you continue to scratch your head, but it does seem like a lever that maybe you could pull one day that\u2019s already been pulled by pretty much everybody else in retail. But I guess, just given the massive growth that you\u2019ve seen with Instacart and your third-party partners there, this does clearly seem to be a segment of your membership base that\u2019s willing to pay a premium or that markup for that service. So, I am just curious if you thought about even a markup type structure for pickup or even like a higher price point membership for a pickup type service?\nRichard Galanti: Well, as it relates to general conversations about it, those are topics that are discussed. One of the challenges right now is there is a lot of the buy online and pickup in store traditional retail promotions are at the same prices which you can come in and buy it for. So, somebody is paying for the picking it up and storean waiting for you to pick it up. I think that will shake you out to over time as people \u2013 as somebody has to pay for either the company or the customer. I am not trying to be \u2013 we are looking at all those things, but we haven\u2019t made any decisions to go forth with it.\nKelly Bania : Okay. And just maybe quick follow-up, you mentioned the 7% ecom penetration from a sales perspective, but just curious if you could share just the percent of your maybe membership households that are engaged with Costco from a digital ecommerce perspective?\nRichard Galanti: We don\u2019t give out that information yet.\nKelly Bania : Okay. Thanks\nRichard Galanti: As you might expect, it\u2019s growing.\nKelly Bania : Of course.\nOperator: And the last question from [Indiscernible] of Jefferies.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for squeezing me in. I just want to follow-up on Rupesh\u2019s earlier question, but ask it a slightly different way which is looking at your cohort of new members that have joined really kind of the third quarter of last year, any performance distinctions or category mix distinctions that might give you encouragement that those members might be a bit more sticky going forward or might be a bit longer lifetime value customers into the future? Thank you.\nRichard Galanti: We don\u2019t have a lot of that information yet. What we \u2013 recognizing that some of them sign up because of COVID and because we can deliver through Instacart food fresh and or we cans serve them online. But there is not a lot to go on yet.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.\nRichard Galanti: Well, thank you everyone. Hopefully, you have a happy and healthy holiday season and on to better 2021. Have a good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Galanti",
            "content": "Thank you, Cindy, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal \u2013 our fiscal year 2021, the 12 weeks ended November 22. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $1.166 billion or $2.62 per share, compared to $844 million or $1.90 per diluted share last year. This year's first quarter included tax benefits of $145 million or $0.33 per share, $0.16 of which was due to the deductibility of the $10 per share special cash dividend to the extent received by the company's received by the Company's 401(k) plan participants; and $0.17 related to stock-based compensation. Last year's first quarter included a $77 million or $0.17 per share tax benefit related to stock-based compensation, as well. And this year's results also included the cost related to our COVID-19 premium wages of $212 million pre-tax or $0.35 per diluted share. Net sales for the quarter increased 16.9% to $42.35 billion, up from $36.24 billion last year in Q1. In terms of our first quarter comp sales metrics, on a reported basis, for the U.S., we reported a 14.6% figure, excluding gas deflation and FX impacts, the 14.6% for the 12 weeks would have been 17.0% increase. Canada, for the 12 weeks reported 16.2% ex gas and FX 16.8%. Other international reported 18.7%, ex gas and FX 17.7%. So all sold for the total company we reported 15.4% comp sales increase and excluding gas deflation and FX, the 15.4% would be 17.1%. Ecommerce, on a reported basis for the 12 weeks was 86.4%, and excluding FX, 86.2%. In terms of Q1 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 5.5% worldwide and plus 7.6% in the U.S. Our average transaction size was up for the company 9.4% in the quarter year-over-year and up 6.5% in the U.S. These include the negative impacts from gas deflation and the positive impact from FX. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted sales by about 30 basis points and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 200 basis points. Going down the income statement, membership fee income came in at $860.9 million, up $57 million or 7.1%. Ex FX, it would have been up $54 million or 6.7%. During the quarter, we opened eight new units. In terms of renewal rates, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate as of the end of Q1 2021 was 90.9%, that compares to a quarter ago of 91.0% and worldwide, it was 88.4%, which was the same as it was a quarter ago. Now the U.S. and Canada rate of 90.9%, compared to the 91.0% this 0.1% decline was primarily the result of what we believe to be deferred renewals in Canada due to the pandemic. For example, traffic or frequency in our Canada warehouses in Q1 came in at a minus 1.3%, compared to a plus 7.6% figure in the United States. By the way, the U.S. renewal rate was the same at both quarters end. In terms of number of members at Q1 end, total paid households at Q1 end was 59.1 million, up from 12 weeks earlier Q4 end of 58.1 million and total cardholders at Q1 end was 107.1 million, compared to 12 weeks earlier at 105.5 million. Also at first quarter end, paid executive memberships totaled 23.3 million, an increase of 642,000 during the fiscal first quarter. On to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin in the first quarter was higher year-over-year by 50 basis points coming in at 11.55% of sales, compared to 11.05% a year ago. Excluding gas deflation, the 50 basis point increase would be 30 basis points. If you jot down two columns of numbers here to shed light on the components of gross margin, on a reported basis in Q1, 2021, the core merchandize margin year-over-year was up on a reported basis 83 basis points, plus 83. Second column, without gas deflation it would have been plus 66 basis points. Ancillary businesses, minus 15 basis points reported and minus 20, ex gas deflation. 2% reward minus 6 basis points and minus 4. Other, minus 12 and minus 12 and if you add up the two columns, on a reported basis again gross margin as reported as a percent of sales year-over-year in the quarter was up 50 basis points on a reported basis and ex gas deflation, up 30 basis points. Now the core merchandize component gross margin sales was higher 83, up 66 ex gas deflation. Similar to the last quarter, we had a sales shift from ancillary to core. This resulted in a higher contribution of our total gross margin dollars coming from the core operations versus last year. Looking at core merchandize categories in relation only to their own sales quarter-on-quarter if you will, margins year-over-year in the quarter were higher by 65 basis points. Fresh foods was again the biggest driver here with strong sales in the fresh we benefited from efficiency gains and labor productivity and significantly lower product spoilage. Food and sundries, soft lines and hard lines, the other three main core components all had higher margins year-over-year in the quarter as well. But fresh foods was the driver. Ancillary and other businesses gross margins as shown here was lower on a reported basis by 15 basis points and minus 20 ex gas deflation. Most of the impact coming from travel and to a lesser extent from gas, optical hearing aids and food courts. Costco logistics, which is our name for the acquisition of Innovel that we did several months ago impacted ancillary margins by minus six basis points, a slight relative improvement from the prior quarter year-over-year. 2% reward. Nothing surprising there. And the other in the minus 12 basis points, all of this was attributable to the costs of the COVID-19 of $53 million of the $212 million total amount previously mentioned. These are the direct costs for incremental wages allocated to our manufacturing, production and fulfillment operations. All told, even with the $53 million of COVID costs hitting the margin, Q4 year-over-year gross margin on a reported basis ex gas still up 30 basis points year-over-year. Moving to SG&A, our reported SG&A in the first quarter as a percent of sales was lower or better year-over-year by 15 basis points coming in at a 10.15% of sales, compared to a year earlier to first quarter of 10.30% and ex gas deflation, the 15 basis improvement would be 32 basis points of improvement. Again jotting down two columns of the numbers reported and without gas deflation, core operations in Q1 on a reported basis was lower or better by 49 basis points, so a plus 49, ex gas deflation of plus 62. Central, plus 1 and plus 3 basis points. Stock compensation, plus 3 and plus 4 basis points. Other, minus 38 and minus 37 basis points and summing those two columns up, total reported SG&A year-over-year was better or lower \u2013 better or plus 15 basis points and ex gas deflation, plus 32 basis points. Now, SG&A into the core, again, it shows ex deflation improvement of 62 basis points. This excludes the COVID cost which I'll talk about in a minute. There was significant \u2013 the basic significant leverage was strong core merchandize sales increases. In terms of others, the minus 38 or minus 37 basis point number ex deflation \u2013 gas deflation. These are incremental costs from the COVID-19 or $159 million of the $212 million total number that we had mentioned earlier. The premium wages have been extended through January 3rd at this time. Again, even including these $159 million of COVID-related premium pay expenses, SG&A year-over-year improved nicely. Next on the income statement is preopening expense, $22 million this year in the first quarter, compared to $14 million a year earlier. We had ten openings, eight net of two relocations during the quarter and four openings gross, three net of one relocation a year earlier. Last year's $14 million number did included a couple million dollars related to preopening on our new poultry \u2013 on our poultry complex, which was opened and went into business right before the beginning of Q1. All told, reported operating income for Q1 2021 increased 35%, coming in at $1.43 billion this year compared to $1.061 billion last year and even a higher percent increase of course, it would have been higher now we had those - the premium pay. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $39 million this year versus $38 million last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was lower by $6 million year-over-year. Interest income itself within interest income and other was lower by $22 million year-over-year, due in large part to lower interest rates, offset by FX and other which was up \u2013 was higher or better by $16 million year-over-year. So, overall, reported pretax income in Q1 2021 was up 34% coming in at $1.42 billion this year, compared to $1.058 billion a year earlier. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was 16.8%, compared to 19.1% in Q1 last year. Both year's tax rates benefited from the tax treatment of stock-based compensation as mentioned earlier. This year's tax rate in the first quarter also benefited from the tax deductibility of the special dividend payable to Company's 401(k) participants as discussed, that portion payable to the 401(k) plan participants as discussed earlier in the call. This year's full \u2013 this full year's - fiscal year's effective tax rate, excluding these discrete items is currently projected to be between 26% and 26.5%. In terms of warehouse expansion, as I mentioned in the first quarter of this fiscal year, we opened eight net new units. Our plan for the year is somewhere in the 20% to 22% range. None in the second quarter and 5 or 6 in Q3 and 7 or 8 in Q4. As of Q1 end, total warehouse square footage stood at 117 million square feet. In terms of capital expenditures, in the first quarter of 2021, we spent approximately $893 million. Our full year CapEx spend for fiscal 2021 is still estimated to be in the $3 billion to $3.2 billion range. In terms of ecommerce, overall, our ecommerce sales in Q1 ex FX increased at 86.2% year-over-year. A few of the stronger departments, food and sundries, housewares, pharmacy, OTC and health and beauty aids, small electrics and TVs and other electronics. Total online grocery grew at a very strong rate in Q1, nearly 300%. This comp numbers that I mentioned the 86.2% figure follow our usual convention which excludes these third-party same day grocery program as they come in themselves and shop in our warehouses and then delivered to our members. If we include the third-party same day in our e-commerce comps, the 86.2% result would have been just over 100% . Innovel, now rebranded as Costco Logistics continues to grow and we continue to push more big and bulky items to the site. We've added - in the past quarter, we added an Instacart scheduler this quarter where members can select specific delivery dates for most big and bulky items and made improvements to our call center with specifically trained agents, as well. That continues to grow nicely. And lastly, a couple of fun sports items just loaded two days ago. We have a Babe Ruth Autographed Baseball for $64,000 and a Ty Cobb Autographed Louisville Slugger Bat for $160,000. We've also recently sold a number of memberships for Wheels Up, a private jet service operator. Now turning to COVID and some of the issues and impacts surrounding it. From a sales perspective, similar to our strong sales results this past summer in our fiscal fourth quarter, we have continued to enjoy strong sales results during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We continue to generate strong sales in food and sundries and health and beauty aids and fresh foods and alike, and we've also benefited from improved sales and products and items for the home as people are spending less on air and travel and hotel and dining, now they seem to have redirected some of those dollars to categories like electronics, furniture and mattresses, exercise equipment, housewares, cookware, domestics, et cetera. And as mentioned earlier, sales in most of our ancillary businesses were slower year-over-year in the quarter, travel, gas, hearing aids and food courts. From a supply chain perspective, 40,000 foot view if you will. Most factories are up and running at our suppliers and in many cases, production capacity has been increased. However, even higher increases in demand of some products are still creating some supply issues. There are instances of 50%, 100% or even more sales increases of an item and if we can procure more, we've had even higher sales. Examples would include things like, exercise equipments, certain major appliances, certain electronics items, as well as certain housewares and small electric items. On the transportation front, there have been some container shortages at origin, as well as some congestion at destination ports here in the states. The latter typically two to four days, but a little longer in some cases. We are managing through it and expect relief not until March or so of 2021, as well, the past few weeks there have been some challenges that you may have read about in the industry in terms of delayed delivery times of items just given the number of items being shipped now through third-party carriers. While this may be due to some sales of members are not confident in timely holiday delivery, we, like others, I am sure have done a couple of things. We've adjusted our stated expected delivery times on our side and reminded people to shop early. And in our case, we took several hundred non-food items, non-food online items that are also in line and they are providing same day delivery fill-ins to card including items like air pods and insta pods, laptops and many over-the-counter and health and beauty aid items, as well as some other home essentials. In terms of food and sundries, continued limits on some paper goods. Demand in sales went up as COVID began spiking again. A toughest area is, Nitrile gloves, surface cleaning wipes and sanitizing sprays, also in some cases, some paper goods. Overall, dairy items are in good shape, as well as proteins and produce on the fresh side. In terms of our holiday merchandize planning and results, Halloween, we went into a little more conservative in terms of costumes and Halloween-specific candy items. We came out of Halloween with pretty clean inventory levels. Christmas, as I think I mentioned on the last earnings call responding to a question, we went a little more basic in terms of needs and uses for the house. So very strongly we've gone into it with fundamental items for the home like housewares, TVs, electronics, even added items like barbeques and pressure washers and furniture items. A little less, we had cut back a little been on seasonal items like holiday decorations and gift wrap and some of the candy and food/gift baskets. In some instances, we already sold through those inventories. Our warehouses overall have remained open and are mostly back to regular hours with an additional hour on any morning for seniors and persons with disabilities. Warehouses are still following social distancing and sanitation guidelines and in some jurisdiction, we have to limit occupancy. Since May 4th, as you may recall, we've required members and employees in the warehouses to wear masks and since November, 16th, we've required facials for those unable to wear a mask. And some of these initiatives of course will extend well into Q2 of this fiscal year. Finally, in terms of upcoming press releases, we will announce our December sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, January 3rd, on Wednesday, January 6th after market closes. With that, I will open it up to questions and answers and I'll turn it back to Cindy. Cindy? Well, I mean, there is a few different things and time periods that will be and questioned. If we recall, there was a big surge in frequency and sales results. The last week in February, and the first two or three weeks of March, when people were coming in and hoarding in our view, and of course, we were running out of everything basics from water to paper goods, to cleaning supplies and things like that. And in some cases, and then beyond that into April, May, there were some issues as there were some COVID spiking at many fresh plants \u2013 protein plants meat and poultry and alike. And so, it's hard to project completely. I think I started of late, we have tried to build a little extra inventory where we can and some of the key things that aren't going to go out of style like paper goods and cleaning supplies. Although then you get to next rush of spiking and whenever extra inventory you had it goes away pretty quickly. Look, we'll continue to work around it. We work \u2013 and in some cases, it's a little easier in a sense that we have fewer suppliers to deal with or fewer items to deal with. Arguably, in other cases, given our huge volumes that creates its own challenges sometimes. I think the bigger challenge is going to be post May last year and this past year, when we saw kind of sales strength not just in those key essential categories like fresh foods and foods and sundries, and paper goods and health and beauty aids, but also on the non-food side, items for the home if you will and those types of basic items. And again, people spending some of those dollars. Look, some things will improve and some things may be degraded a little bit. Some things that are degraded may take a while and not everything is going to happen unlike what was not going up one day and everything is going to get better from a food standpoint in terms of restaurants being opened. And so, I think, we are in it together and we feel pretty good that we've got a good format to serve our members well and we'll go from there. Well, as it relates to promotional forms that we do like the mailers or even online type of mailers, these are some of those have been changed because some of the big ticket non-food \u2013 not big ticket, I am sorry. Some of the big size items that are always in there like paper goods, like cleaning supplies, in some cases we've had to eliminate some of those items from the mailer. We put other items in. In some cases, it's done fine and in some cases, it's a little bit less of a sales increase. But that's not just going forward, that's been in the last few months as well that we've changed those things. I think we've been pretty good at pivoting and adding new items. I think the examples of \u2013 for Christmas, while we may have \u2013 maybe and went a little too deep into cutting back, not they were big cuts, but we are running out of some of those decorative things we could do earlier and we would have like to. We also though found success in lots of essential, basic fundamental items. I don't think \u2013 I mean, the first Christmas, we probably brought in barbeque grills and pressure washers to market. And they are doing well, because people are buying gifts for the home. Yes. Well, first of all, talking to the buyers, they definitely feel that some of the merchandize and sales were pulled forward into November, not only from December, but even the week of November and there has been articles out there about Thanksgiving and overall, not Costco-specific, but just in general about what's going on online and what have you. And so, certainly some of that kind of got push forward. In terms of some things, I mean there are examples where instead of buying 10% more this year of a given item, we bought 10% or 20% less. So, we still bought a lot. We just not like we cut our order back by half. But in retrospect, we probably could have sold a little bit more. I don't have a dollar number. It's probably not that meaningful. For every negative there is another positive. Needless to our say, our comps overall have been very strong. Well, I think, in terms of shopping frequency? No. Oh, I am sorry. Okay. I didn't hear the first part of the question. Well, I think we opened a few more units than we did a year earlier. Without looking that deeply, that's probably most of it. Thank you. Well, I'll tell you, it's sort of in-store of course, and warehouse, we've got about 3800 active items. Online, we typically got somewhere in the high single digit thousands, I mean, call it, 9,000 plus. I am sorry, and in terms of sales, it's about 7% of sales. Now we don't include in that number as I mentioned like the third party sales like the Instacart Same Day Fresh , because their employee or a contracted employee is coming into Costco shopping just like any other customer coming to shop. So that you could add a little bit more to that. But in terms of what we call online, it's about 7%. I think it was 6% in fiscal 20 for the entirety, and of course, it was half way through the year when you saw ecom percentages increases jump dramatically with the advent of COVID. Overall, ecommerce a little less profitable. You've got category-wise, it's profitable. You've got \u2013 category-wise, you've got merchandize categories that don't include some of the highest gross margin components of our business like fresh, like apparel in a big way in terms of the penetration. You've got electronics which is a lower than average margin business both in-store and online and so much bigger percentage of penetration online, so they are examples. Certainly, the profitability of ecommerce has been helped with the types of comp sales increases we've had over the past year. But also over this past year, there is some of the cost inefficiencies of growing it so fast. We \u2013 in terms of fulfillment, as we are continually adding locations where to shift out of and getting closer to the customer as this overall size of the business has grown a lot. And as I mentioned earlier, the investment in Innovel, recall, we are calling Costco Logistics, that was a \u2013 as we expected a hit year-over-year to the margin simply because it's being ramped up and upgrading it. I think it's \u2013 I mean, our best guess is, it's complete pull-forward. I mean, the fact is, is people marketing bigger ticket items and some of those types of holiday items earlier in November. Yes, Bob, here mentioned that, Black Friday promotions this year. More of those things we promoted earlier in the month. And not an assessment everybody else out there too. We definitely think that, look, being essential in recognizing the people clearly are coming in to buy food and cleaning items and health and beauty aids and alike. That gets you in the door. And certainly in our view, given that money is being spent on other things in normal years perhaps is being spent more for things for the home. We have that as well and I think that has helped us in that regard. I buy it. I'd like to think part of it is people feel hopefully, at least relatively safe coming into a big wide open box environment where we've done and we think a pretty good job of social distancing and other safety protocols. Yes. I think most of it is strong sales which shows its brightest colors with fresh food where you've got two cross components that have improved dramatically, spoilage and labor productivity. So, that has certainly helped. Oh, less promotion. The other, Michael is, I think you've all read about this from an industry perspective. There has been less promotional activities out there. While we were still getting great values on things, when you look at TVs in general, well, prices have come down across the board just because they always do over time. And these seem to be getting better, bigger and less expensive. There is not the kind of promotional money being thrown at it by the manufacturers because they haven't had to. And so, I think that too has had some impact. You as well. Virtually all. I believe part of the challenges is on some items as we work with our suppliers and ourselves as well. We want you to be able to have sign in to see the prices. About 50-50. A little less than 50 is being drop shipped. Same to you. Well, we'll find out. Needless to say I can't comment on that, but a big chunk of the difference of 14 I may have round \u2013 honestly down to 14 and now it's rounding up to whatever. But at the end of the day, there is more hours is the biggest delta. More cumulative hours. We have the... That's relatively small. Well, I can't be that specific. We continue over the last three or four years, we've continued to work to lower the effective average markup across the board on items. There is some discretion on some to be lower than them and some to be higher but there is an average, which includes both their markup, plus whatever other fees that person is spending here, whether it's a per delivery fee or per monthly fee or per monthly fee to Instacart. As given some of the unique issues during the end of the year with the high demand for shipping, and the capacity issues out there with the third-party shippers we \u2013 given that Instacart is always coming in, we've added some items to the tray. In some cases, there is a maximum markup on those that is \u2013 in many cases, smaller than that \u2013 quite a bit smaller than that on that mid to high teen number percentage-wise. Well, I mean, historically as you know for 35 years, we've effectively raised the basic fee $5 every roughly five years and I say roughly it could be 5, 5.5 years. And the executive membership has been raised to originally started at 100 and now it's 110 then 120. The last time we did the increase was I believe was in June-ish of 2016. So five years \u2013 it's June 2016. But it was June of one of the years either 2016 or 2017, but it will be five years from then that we might look. You mentioned that, we've done it when things are \u2013 sales have been stronger and when sales have been weaker, when the economies get to hit or whatever else. We look at it and somewhat it dependently at that. We look at it and we feel heavily improved the value of the membership by more than that five or respective $5 or $10. And I am not suggesting we might wait or not, but time will tell. Historically, we've always thought very good about when we've done it and certainly the value proposition has been enhanced much \u2013 at a much greater multiple than the $5 or $10. Thanks. You too. I believe there \u2013 we and the country are in the first phase of the vaccination process. We are not participating in that. But I believe Phase 2 which will be just a short period down the road. Our pharmacies will also be part of the many pharmacies throughout the country that are going to be providing the service of vaccinations for them. We are in Phase 1 in the State of Alaska only currently. But I think throughout our country we plan to be in Phase 2 which will be the big push after this first initial round. And in terms of managing inventories, while space is not infinite, certainly the cost of carrying extra inventory isn't very expensive right now, given very low interest rates. But at the end of the day, as I mentioned, it's little earlier, we \u2013 I think we plan positively in terms of how our sales have been and to the extent of the example of those seasonal items, we keep down a little bit. But not a lot. And I think we'll continue to do that kind of planning. A lot of times on items that are short, but there is certainly no risk of having the only risk of having is some extra paper towels for a few weeks is the risk of having them. There is not any obsolescence or markdown risk on it. We always tried in times when there is more of that available, we'll build up a few extra weeks of supply. But overall, I don't see a big change in our inventory turns or payable cycles. I can say that more by comp sales than anything. When we were enjoying a pre-COVID a 6% to 8% comp sales number, inventories as a percent of \u2013 payables as a percent of inventories was whatever the number was. When we saw the big increase in comps, you saw the payables as a percent of inventories going up. Well, look, we even today want things to get back to normal from a business standpoint and also most importantly from a personal standpoint. And over the next couple of years, god willing, starting with this process of vaccinations and vaccines and hopefully a big chunk of this progress through by the beginning or during the summer people will get out more and will be going back to restaurants and alike and will that have an impact on our food sales? Of course, it will. So, some of this positive will be sticky. Some of the new members will be sticky and we'll go from there. I think that, there are lots of attributes to value and customer loyalty, certainly, the best prices on great quality merchandize that the member trusts in our view is the biggest attribute. And that's where we start from. We \u2013 ecommerce is certainly \u2013 and the acquisition of Innovel in terms of big ticket items and having a great service and a great value for those items we think helps us. But ultimately, we still want our members to come into the warehouse. When they come in, they see the items and they are more likely to buy some of those items and certainly, driving them with great value and great quality is what we are all about. Well, the only two data points we've given you is in Q4, year-over-year it was about, I think an eight basis point margin hit and in Q1 which we just reported for this new fiscal year was a six basis point margin hit. As guessing games go, assume that there will be constant improvement in that over the next several quarters. So that it won't be a negative. That doesn't include any benefit we get from increased sales of those items and the margin associated with that. But when we bought this we knew that they would be dilutive from an earnings standpoint for the \u2013 certainly in the first year and perhaps into the second year hopefully on a decreasing basis and certainly in the first two quarters it would indicate a little of that. But at the end of the day, we think it \u2013 those companies that have had their own infrastructure to be able to do last mile delivery and installations, it's a positive certainly the home improvement companies have done that and the retailers and it worked out for us and we are excited about what we can do with it. Same to you. Not really. Before each call, I'll sit down with the Head of Merchandizing and some of the other senior people in merchandizing and just get the color on their departments and what's going on. And it was a by the way comment that, with things coming from Asia as an example, or in general, there is container shortages. And so, we may take a few extra days to get things on to ship. Or the ship may its sailing not full in some cases. The same thing is on some of the big ports in the United States like on the West Coast particularly. They've mentioned two to four days of delay. Again, two day for us is not a lot but when you are moving inventory fast, you want to have it \u2013 once it's \u2013 you've ordered it, you want to it go to put on the ship and get here in on to our floor. So, it's not a big deal and the comment was, I said what will improve and said probably not until February, March. So, I just \u2013 that's what I threw out. Not any more impacts from that. We are not rethinking it. We continue to look at it and scratch our heads a little bit. But at this juncture we don't have any current plan to do so. We don't \u2013 the gallons sold were down \u2013 not down as much as they have been and it's troughed a few months ago and you are right, on margins, that not a double. I can't give you any quantitative number there. But in terms of margins were up year-over-year as a percent and gallons were down year-over-year. Well, merchants are feeling pretty \u2013 I would say, aggressive with this. They feel that, again, some of it was pull-forward. But there is still \u2013 and again, running out of some gift wrapping paper two weeks before you wanted to is not the end of the world. But every sale is a sale that we want. And the same token bringing in fundamental items that if you end up having a few extra SKUs or few extra quantity of certain SKUs the day after Christmas is not going to kill you because it's not stuff that's seasonal that has to be marked down in a big way. So, I think that, we can lean it to it recognizing that our sales overall particularly brick and mortar have done well. That we are basing our assumptions on what we are going to do I think over the next two weeks, positive relative to this. Recognizing there could be some pull-forward and it will be some because of the dates got a little longer on shipping. But at the end of the day, we see that \u2013 we are always with you. That should help the in-store experience and we'll see. What we can \u2013 like you to do is just like in a 10-K, you got to put the \u2013 you got to rank them in order of dollars. So, in the case of travel, first of all it's a very high gross margin business. To the extent that we are simply acting as a broker like our car rentals, there is sales and no coast of sales equals gross margin or very little cost of sales. Only when we curate an item and take ownership of it, you will like hundred crew ship weeks or whatever I am making this example up, where you sell $100,000 or something and make a few thousand dollars or $5,000 of margin. That's a 5%. But you have big chunks of that business that are 80 plus percent margin. So, it's a business that started to show a little bit of life as we ended December. But with the spiking of COVID in the last several weeks that has dissipated quite a bit. And even some of the life that occurred in the summer were bookings out as for Christmas some of those are being cancelled as you would expect them to be. So, it's that \u2013 it's the rank order of them which one hit harder a little bit. Well, I mean, we look at our comp shops compared to warehouse, clubs as well as comps specifically on certain items and at their traditional retail formats, we feel very good about our competitive mote if you will. And we don't think that's an issue at all for us right now. But we are the ones that keep pushing and pushing the limits further. Thank you. Gosh! When I find out, I'll let you know. I mean, what's happened of course with everything in the strength \u2013 both the strength in electronic items, TVs, air pods and everything else of between and laptops and the demand for those things is enormous and in some cases, some shortages of supplies in general even if capacity has gone up it's going to overlap more. So, and it's hard to say. I don't. I am sorry. Very, very, very little. Oh, it's not even 8%. It's very, very, very low. Three verys. Triple verys. Well, keep in mind that there is a chunk of it that is weekend debit and credit card receivables that could be $1 billion or $1.5 billion. There is upwards of just under $1 billion that is related to insurance captives and alike. There is a $2 billion to $3 billion that's overseas and different countries which for whatever reasons is the last whether you want to bring back because of whatever withholding your other taxes related to it. So, at the end of the day, someone asked the question after we announced the $10 dividend we could have done more. The answer is we could have but why rush? I mean, right now, we still don't know what's going to happen with COVID and what may happen next year in the economy. And so, we'll probably have a little more cash than normal \u2013 than pre-COVID if you will. But that's okay too. You mean, the average U.S. hourly wage? . I think we are in the \u2013 well, ex the $2 we are either right above or just approaching $24 average in the U.S. In March I believe, last year. Last March. Beginning of March. March of 2019. I believe it was at the beginning of March. Whatever that Monday start for that weekly pay period was or bi-weekly period was. And that was $2 across the board. Excuse me. Yes. Thanks, you too. They both have stronger comps. Well. I don't have that detail in front of me unfortunately. And when I look at comps by country, in local currencies, we are - in most countries we are back to normal, if not a little better. The only thing that I've noted is, is that when it first started a few weeks ago, or when \u2013 the California, everyone there was waiting for - in California, everybody was waiting to hear what the new restrictions was going to be in terms of lockdowns. There was a spike in shopping and people were coming in. So, we had particular strength over a couple of week period when more spiking was accruing. Thank you. You too. Why don't we take two more questions? We will take two more questions, Cindy. Well, as it relates to general conversations about it, those are topics that are discussed. One of the challenges right now is there is a lot of the buy online and pickup in store traditional retail promotions are at the same prices which you can come in and buy it for. So, somebody is paying for the picking it up and storean waiting for you to pick it up. I think that will shake you out to over time as people \u2013 as somebody has to pay for either the company or the customer. I am not trying to be \u2013 we are looking at all those things, but we haven't made any decisions to go forth with it. We don't give out that information yet. As you might expect, it's growing. We don't have a lot of that information yet. What we \u2013 recognizing that some of them sign up because of COVID and because we can deliver through Instacart food fresh and or we cans serve them online. But there is not a lot to go on yet. Well, thank you everyone. Hopefully, you have a happy and healthy holiday season and on to better 2021. Have a good day."

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to CFO, Richard Galanti. Please go ahead.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you, Lateef, and good afternoon to everyone. I\u2019ll start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\u2019s call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the Company\u2019s public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today\u2019s press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the 16 weeks ended this past August 28th. Net income for the quarter was $1.868 billion or $4.20 per diluted share compared to $1.67 billion or $3.76 per diluted share a year ago. Last year\u2019s fourth quarter was negatively impacted by an asset write-off of $84 million pretax or $0.14 per diluted share. Net income for the fiscal year totaled $5.84 billion or $13.14 a share compared to $5.01 billion or $11.27 per diluted share the prior fiscal year. Net sales for the fourth quarter increased 15.2% to $70.76 billion as compared to $61.44 billion reported last year in the fourth quarter. On a comparable sales basis from the fourth quarter, U.S. for the 16-week period on a reported basis had comp sales of 15.8%. When you exclude gas inflation and FX -- gas inflation, it\u2019d be 9.6%; Canada, 13.4% reported; 13.7% ex gas and FX; Other International, 2.9% reported and 11.3% ex gas and FX. So all told, total company was reported as 13.7%, and excluding gas and FX, plus 10.4%. Separately, e-commerce, 7.1% reported and again, excluding FX, 8.4%. In terms of the Q4 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 7.2% worldwide and up 5.2% in the U.S. Our average transaction or ticket was up 6.0% worldwide and up 10.0% in the U. S. during the fourth quarter. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by a little over 2%, and gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 5.5%. The best-performing core categories in the quarter were candy, frozen, kiosks, tire, lawn and garden, jewelry, toys, bakery and deli. In terms of ancillary businesses, the best performers were gas and food courts. And in other businesses, travel and business centers performed best relative to the prior fiscal fourth quarter results. Going down the income statement to membership fee income on a reported basis. Membership fee income came in at $1.327 billion or 1.88%. That was up $93 million or 7.5% on a reported basis, again, with weaker foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. That number, excluding the impact of FX, would have been $29.8 million higher, and the 7.5% reported increase would have been a 10% increase. In terms of renewal rates, we again hit all-time highs. At Q4 end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate came in at 92.6%, which is three-tenths of a percentage point higher from 16 weeks earlier at Q3 end when we were at 92.3%. And our worldwide renewal rate came in at the end of the fiscal year at 90.4%, up four-tenths of a percentage point from Q3 end when it was 90.0%. In terms of the number of member households and cardholders, at Q4 end, we ended the fourth quarter with 65.8 million paid household members and 118.9 million cardholders, both up 6.5% from a year earlier. And that 6.5% increase in number of members and cardholders is on about -- just under a 3% increase in the number of locations. During the year, we opened 23 locations on a base that began the year with 815 warehouses. At Q4 end, our paid executive memberships totaled 29.1 million, an increase of 1.2 million or 74, 000 per week during the 16 weeks since third quarter end. Executive members now represent over 44% of our members and just under 72% of our worldwide sales. In terms of membership fees and a possible increase, there are no specific plans regarding a fee increase at this time. We\u2019re pleased with our growth in both, top line sales and membership households over the last several quarters, and member loyalty is reflected in increasing member renewal rates. We\u2019ll let you know when something is about to happen. Moving on to fourth quarter gross margins. For the quarter, gross margin on a reported basis came in at 10.18% compared -- down 74 basis points from last year\u2019s reported gross margin of 10.92%. Now the 74% -- the 74 basis-point year-over-year reduction is on a reported basis. Excluding gas inflation, it was minus 22 basis points. And as we normally do, we actually jot down a few numbers, and then we\u2019ll elaborate a little bit more on margin. So, the two columns would be reported year-over-year change and the second one would be ex gas inflation, net year-over-year change. So, the core merchandise margin on a reported basis, minus 67 basis points year-over-year; ex gas inflation, minus 23 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses, the second line item, plus 20 and plus 34; our 2% reward, 0 and minus 5; LIFO, minus 27 and minus 28; and all told, total minus 74 reported, as I mentioned, and minus 22 on -- excluding gas inflation basis. Starting with the core. Core merchandise\u2019s contribution to gross margin was lower by 67 basis points year-over-year and by 23 ex gas inflation. The sales mix negatively impacted the core, primarily from the lower sales penetration of total core sales relative to our increasing and outsized gasoline sales. In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in Q4, our core and core margins were lower by 26 basis points. That\u2019s pretty much in line with each of the last three quarters when it ranged from minus 39 basis points year-over-year in Q3, minus 28 in Q2 and minus 18 in Q1 on a year-over-year basis. So again, for the quarter, it was minus 26 core-on-core. Ancillary and other businesses gross margin was higher by 20 basis points and higher by 34 basis points ex gas inflation in the quarter. Gas, of course, as well as business centers and travel were better year-over-year, offset somewhat by e-com, pharmacy, food court and optical, but overall, a positive year-over-year change. Our 2% reward, as I mentioned, on an ex gas inflation basis was higher or down 5 -- lower or down 5 basis points, implying higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. In terms of LIFO -- LIFO, as you know, with inflation has been increasing. It was 27 basis points, down year-over-year -- or higher year-over-year. LIFO charge this year on an ex gas inflation basis, 28 basis points higher, and that represented a $223 million charge in the quarter. Recall that our LIFO charges were relatively small in the first part of the year at $14 million; last quarter, in the third quarter, $130 million; and then as I mentioned here, $223 million for the quarter. Moving to SG&A. We showed good results. Reported SG&A came in at 8.53% compared to last year\u2019s 9.22% or an improvement of 69 basis points. But again, ex gas inflation, the improvement was still good at 26 basis points lower year-over-year. Again, jotting down a few numbers here, jotting down the numbers on a core operations basis, on a reported basis, that was plus 50 basis points or positive reduction of 50 improvement; ex gas inflation, plus 12 basis points; central, plus 2 and minus 3; stock compensation, plus 2 and plus 1; preopening expense, plus 1 and plus 2; other, plus 14 and plus 14. That gets you down to again on a reported basis, year-over-year SG&A was improved by [69] (ph) basis points; and ex gas inflation by 26 basis points. In terms of the quarter year-over-year, the core operations was, again, better by 12, excluding the impact of gas inflation. Keep in mind, these results include the starting wage increases we instituted in October of 2021, so in the first quarter of this fiscal year -- this past fiscal year, as well as new wage and benefits increases implemented during the third quarter in March of this year as well as the impact of 8 weeks in this quarter as we increase the top-of-scale increase that went into effect July 4th. So, a few increases that we\u2019ve done this year. And still, we feel pretty good SG&A improvement given our sales strength. Central was lower by 2 basis points and higher by 3 ex gas inflation. Nothing big to talk about there. Again, stock compensation I mentioned. Preopening, I\u2019ve just -- we\u2019ve noted that since we now include preopening on the income statement as part of SG&A instead of a separate line item. And other, again, the 14 basis points, recall that that included that last year\u2019s write-off in the quarter, totaling $84 million. All told, reported operating income in the fourth quarter increased 10%, coming in at $2.497 billion. A little of that benefit was that asset write-off last year. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $48 million this year versus $52 million last year, relatively similar. Interest income and other for the quarter was lower by $1 million year-over-year, coming in at $67 million this year versus $68 million last year. Interest income was actually higher, but that was offset by unfavorable FX impact, which pretty much offset each other to be roughly flat year-over-year. Overall, reported pretax income was up 10%, coming in at $2.516 billion this year, up from $2.291 billion a year earlier. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 25.4% compared to 26.1% in Q4 last year. The fiscal \u201823 effective tax rate, we estimate, is currently projected to be approximately 26%. Net -- one thing I\u2019ll mention, we haven\u2019t mentioned in the past. Net income attributable to Costco, that line item was up 12%. Recall that on June 30th this past year, we acquired the 45% minority interest from our JV partner in Taiwan. So, we now own all of Costco Taiwan. As a result, net income attributable to non-controlling interest was better by $14 million in the quarter. The non-controlling interest line will become zero going forward, essentially, a small amount, but pretty much zero. A few other items of note in terms of warehouse expansion. In the fourth quarter, we opened 9 net new warehouses. So for the full year, we opened 26 warehouses, but that included 3 relocations, so a net increase during the year of 23 locations. In the fourth quarter of the 9 we opened, 5 were in the U.S., 2 were in Canada and 1 each in Korea and Japan. In fiscal \u201823, we expect to open 29 new warehouses, including 4 relos, so for a net of 25 new warehouses. These 25 planned net new openings are made up of 15 in the U.S. and 10 in Other International, including our first locations in each of New Zealand and Sweden, and our third and fourth locations in China. Regarding capital expenditures, our fourth quarter Q4 spending CapEx was approximately $1.26 billion. And for the full year, CapEx expenditures was $3.9 billion. Our estimate for the upcoming year fiscal \u201823 CapEx to be approximately the same in the $3.8 billion to $4 billion range. In terms of e-commerce business, e-com sales in the fourth quarter ex FX increased 8.4%. Stronger departments in terms of year-over-year percentage increases were tires, lawn, patio and garden, prescription pharmacy and health and beauty aids. The largest e-com merchandise department in dollars, what we call majors, which includes everything from computers to appliances to TVs to audio, et cetera, was up in the high single digits. And Costco Grocery, including our third-party delivery, two-day dry, fresh and frozen, continue to grow. They were up 20% in the quarter. An update on Costco Logistics. With Costco Logistics, we continue to transition from vendor drop ship to direct ship from our own inventory, particularly in big and bulky items. Overall, this lowers the cost of the merchandise and improves delivery times on service levels to our members, and I\u2019ll share with you some statistics to that in a minute. Prior to this acquisition in the U.S., we were completing a few years ago about 2 million big and bulky deliveries and installations per year. In fiscal \u201822, we completed 4.3 million big and bulky deliveries and installation. Previously, all of those 2 million deliveries and installations were made by third parties. In fiscal \u201822, about 70% or a little over 3 million of the 4.3 million were done by us. In the fourth quarter, in fact, that percentage of deliveries and installations done by -- performed by us was 81%. Pre-acquisition, the estimated average days to deliver was above 15 days, and we were working with over 100 delivery partners. Today, our average delivery time for big and bulky is just under 5 days, and we\u2019re continuing to work to improve that. And we were down to 8 delivery -- primary delivery partners. A few comments regarding inflation. We\u2019ve seen minor improvement in a few areas. But all in, pressures from higher commodity prices, higher wages and higher transportation costs and supply chain disruptions. They\u2019re still present, but we are seeing just a little light at the end of the tunnel. And if you recall in the third quarter, we indicated that price inflation overall was about 7% plus for us. For the fourth quarter and talking with our merchants, the estimated price inflation overall was about 8%, a little higher on the food and sundries side, a little lower on fresh foods, and both higher and lower on the nonfood side. We\u2019re seeing commodities -- some commodities prices coming down, such as gas, steel, beef, relative to a year ago, even some small cost changes in plastics. We\u2019re seeing some relief on container pricing. Wages are still the higher thing when we talk to our suppliers. And as we all know, wages still seem to be the one thing that\u2019s still relatively higher. But overall, some beginnings of some light at the end of that tunnel. And of course, that could change each week. In all, despite current inflation levels, we believe we continue to remain competitive versus our others and able to raise prices as cost increases, hopefully, of course, a little less than others with whom we compete. Many of you have asked about private label with the recent inflationary environment and what\u2019s happening, are people trading down? And of course, our first response, of course, is they\u2019re not trading down. They\u2019re trading up or certainly trading the same. In terms of Kirkland Signature merchandise penetration, and excluding gas and other businesses that carry the Kirkland name. Kirkland Signature merchandise is up just under 1% in terms of penetration compared to a year ago. Our KS merchandise penetration is about 28% for the year. This is similar to historical trends where it\u2019s increasing slowly and steadily over time. So no big dramatic change from the past there. In terms of supply chain. Generally, supply chain has improved a little, including on-time deliveries. We started seeing container prices coming down. First place you see it, of course, is in the spot market and then you\u2019ll start to see it hopefully in some other contracts as they continue. No longer any big capacity issues or container shortages. Domestically, port delays have improved. And while the rail strike that was in the news a few weeks ago was thankfully averted. In anticipation of strike, there were some rail ramp closures and delays in restarting that. But the view from our buyers is that this should be eliminated for the most part towards the end of this week. Switching over to inventory levels. Our total inventory at Q4 end was up year-over-year, just -- was up just under 26% year-over-year. At the end of the third quarter, it was up just over 26%. Of the 26% increase, an estimated 10 to 11 percentage points of it is inflation. That\u2019s that 8% number. And new warehouse growth, that\u2019s that 3% number in terms of unit growth over the last year, but still up year-over-year. Additionally, we\u2019re lapping some low stocks in certain departments as a result of last year\u2019s high demand, specifically in nonfood areas where last year, we were about 90% of our targeted inventory levels. Food and sundries and fresh are in good shape, we feel. Our weak supply is comparable year-over-year. In terms of nonfood inventories, it\u2019s up in certain categories. Again, this is in part a result of being light in certain departments last year, as mentioned earlier. The good news so far, initial seasonal sales seem to be going well, as evidenced in our monthly sales reports. And all told, we would expect the 26% year-over-year increase to start to head down as it has in just the past few weeks a little bit. Lastly, as a reminder, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results for the 5 weeks ending Sunday, October 2nd, this next week on Wednesday -- in two weeks, on Wednesday, October 5th, after the market closes. With that, I will open it up to questions and answers with Lateef. Thanks.\nSimeon Gutman: Good afternoon, everyone. Richard, I want to ask a couple of questions about membership fees. So first of all, if -- you said you were comfortable with sales. So, I\u2019m questioning if your tentative -- you\u2019re worried about the sales rate if you raise it. And then, is it fair if you don\u2019t raise it? It means you\u2019re also comfortable with the rate of EBIT growth in the business because that\u2019s been a tool for the business over time? And I know you don\u2019t guide, but I\u2019m obviously trying to get you to answer that.\nRichard Galanti: Sure. Well, nice try. No, look, at the end of the day, we\u2019ve always been told and we\u2019ve told you guys that we\u2019re a top line company. We\u2019re looking to always drive sales. Certainly, as we\u2019ve increased member fees historically about every 5, 5.5 years, we\u2019ve turned around and used it to drive more value. And whenever we do it, we\u2019ll do that. I think at the end of the day, it\u2019s -- and I also want to point out, of course, if you look at the last 3 increases, on average, they were 5 years and 7 months apart. If you look at June of \u201817, plus 5 years and 7 months, you\u2019re talking roughly January \u201823. Now, I\u2019m not suggesting it\u2019s January \u201823. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s not there yet anyway. And our view is, is we are confident in our ability to do so and at some point, we will. But it\u2019s a question of when, not if. And given the headline of inflation and concerns about recession, we feel quite comfortable driving sales and earnings the way we are right now. And we still have that arrow in our quiver as we go forward.\nSimeon Gutman: And then, maybe the follow-up, same topic, still. The way -- your new fiscal year, you\u2019ve obviously planned a year. Do you cut back or you curtail spending or investments in any way that runs through the P&L if you\u2019re not planning to do it or if you are planning to do it?\nRichard Galanti: Not at all. I mean, it\u2019s steady as she goes in terms of CapEx and what we want to do, and what we want to do with pricing and competitive pricing. And we\u2019re not the only company out there, but as we\u2019ve seen some slight declines in reported gross margin not only this quarter, but in the last several quarters, part of that was just the upsized improvement in margin during the first year of COVID. But we are not -- as you know, we\u2019re not shy about doing what we have to do to drive the top line, and we\u2019ll continue to do that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer.\nRupesh Parikh: So, Richard, I guess just going back to your expense commentary. There was a sequential pickup in your expense growth versus Q3. Besides the wage increases, was there anything else that was unique to the quarter that you\u2019d call out?\nRichard Galanti: Well, other than it was -- it was 16 weeks versus 12 weeks, but are you talking about on a year-over-year basis?\nRupesh Parikh: Yes. Year-over-year. Yes. I think it\u2019s\u2026\nRichard Galanti: I think the outsized thing is just that. I mean, are utilities costs up? Sure. But the outsized thing would be the wage increases. But I\u2019m sure IT is up -- IT is always up a little more as everybody is doing more technology-wise.\nRupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. And then just on the health of the consumer, just given many concerns out there, anything to know, like any change in consumer behavior or even in your majors category, are you guys seeing any changes versus maybe your expectations there?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think I mentioned -- or we\u2019ve mentioned when we talked to some of you over the various months was there -- when beef prices skyrocketed, now they\u2019re coming down versus a year ago, but when they skyrocket, you see a change. Irrespective of the state of the economy, you see some changes from beef to poultry and those examples. Somebody made -- one of the buyers had made a comment a few months ago that they saw some increased penetration of canned chicken and tuna for that reason. But at the end of the day, we haven\u2019t seen any big changes in that. Part of it is hard to see because we -- during these two years of COVID, we enjoyed such strength in big-ticket items. And if -- like consumer electronics, if it\u2019s up a little versus up a lot the last two years, incrementally, we know in each of those cases, our numbers relative to industries comparisons are still -- we\u2019re still beating the rest of the industry in terms of sales growth. Is the sales growth is slower than it was last year? Yes. It still has a positive plus in front of it, and it\u2019s still better than the industry as a whole.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett.\nChuck Grom: Richard, on core-on-core three-year -- on a three-year basis, it looks like you guys showed a nice improvement from the last quarter. Can you unpack that for us a little bit across the four major categories?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I don\u2019t have all that detail in front of me. But generally speaking, the thing that was outsized in the biggest way in the first year or so of COVID was fresh. As you\u2019ll recall, with fresh, you had virtually no spoilage, and you had much higher labor productivity. So, you had huge -- you had 3-digit improvements in margins there. So, that\u2019s the comparison. And we\u2019ve talked about that in the last several quarters on a year-over-year basis compared to those two years, it\u2019s come down as a percent, still up from where it was pre-COVID. Other than that, there\u2019s all kinds of things that impact other departments. At the extreme, you have a small business, but in terms of our income statement, travel. Travel is almost a brokerage business where it\u2019s all margin -- a lot of it is margin. And that went way down, and now it\u2019s improving from where -- it\u2019s gone way down. So that helps you a little bit. But there\u2019s a lot of moving parts to that. I think fresh was the biggest outlier. Then, during supply chain things and everything else, there were impacts in certain departments or allocations, things like that. There was less -- I\u2019m just shooting from the hip here. There was less promotional activity in consumer electronics because of shortages of chips or electronics. And so, there\u2019s a lot of puts and takes. But overall, I would say fresh was the one that was most meaningful in that regard.\nChuck Grom: And then on the LIFO charge, 28 basis points, I think you said; last quarter, it was 25. I guess, I was surprised that it wasn\u2019t higher given how much prices have moved up over the past 3 to 4 months. Can you just maybe just give us a refresh on the accounting for that? And what happens in the coming quarters as we start to lap the big charges from this year?\nRichard Galanti: Sure. Well, two things. Again, if you look sequentially in Q1, it was sub-$20 million; in Q2, it was sub-$40 million -- $30 million something, then $100 million something, then $200 million something. Part of that is, is -- the way we account for it is, at the end of the Q1, when we saw what the trend was, you then estimate what you believe it\u2019s going to be for the year, and pro rate a quarter of that or 12 weeks of that to that quarter. And that as it continues to increase, you [proration] (ph) adjusted on a year-to-date basis. So, that skews that a little bit. That\u2019s the way we\u2019ve done it historically in prior inflationary times. The other comment you asked about is it seemed like it\u2019d be even higher in Q4. The fact is, is we, too, thought halfway through the quarter, it would be higher than this. Part of that was if I bifurcated Q4 into the first 8 weeks and the second 8 weeks, the first 8 weeks showed a level of increase that would have required a larger LIFO charge. It seemed to, in some cases, flatten out a little bit during the last several weeks of the quarter, which meant that it came down from what our expectation was. So again, I think that is consistent with I mentioned about we\u2019re seeing a little light at the end of the tunnel. I\u2019m not just -- and there\u2019s little [Technical Difficulty] some of the buyers about a couple of items going down in price. And you can rest assured that our partners are calling the suppliers. As you said, the price went up because of steel prices. Well, steel prices are down. What gives? And so we\u2019ll continue to do that. But it\u2019s a slow road. And -- but we are, again, seeing a little bit of improvement at least in the second half of the fourth quarter. And we\u2019ll see where it goes from here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez of Citi.\nBrandon Cheatham: [Indiscernible] Cheatham on for Paul. Thanks for taking our question . I want to dig in on the inventory piece a little bit, up about 26%. How much of that is you categorize as general merch? You had some pretty big competitors that have been trying to clear some of their general merch, as I\u2019m sure everyone knows. So, as you kind of reach holiday, can you give us a sense of where you are for general merch inventory? Any plans to kind of further discount there to try and get leaner?\nRichard Galanti: Sure. Well, first of all, without being too specific, there\u2019s a decent chunk in there that I would call deep freeze from last year. My example I\u2019ve used when talking to people is the Christmas trees that retail for $150 to $400. And they came in after Christmas or essentially after Christmas. And the good news is, is that they don\u2019t really change in style. And they\u2019re now -- and if you go to Costco, you\u2019re going to see it on the floor. And the -- if you add in the cost of holding them and a little cost of interest, I think they\u2019re still a little cheaper than the ones we added to the inventory this year. So in a perverse way, that one didn\u2019t hurt us that example other than we don\u2019t like to have extra inventory. And so, there are some seasonal things that came in late. Probably a bigger piece of the delta is us building up inventory, particularly on big and bulky and fulfillment -- both e-com fulfillment and big and bulky. The last part is early holiday. We did consciously bring in some stuff. Part of it was not knowing what was happening with supply chain and how many weeks of delay at each item was. We bought stuff in consciously a little early. And then as I mentioned, supply chain has improved a little. That\u2019s helped you. So again, there\u2019s things that have helped it and hurt it -- increased it or reduced it. The other thing that\u2019s increased a little bit, even some things like seasonal things like air conditioning and fans, which was -- we had a very strong season, but there were some delays in getting that stuff in. That will be a small impact from a seasonal standpoint going forward. But net-net, I think that while the 26% number was relatively same at year-over-year Q3 end -- Q3 year-over-year and at Q4 end, again, in talking with Ron and Claudine and the merchants, and again, seeing what we\u2019ve seen just in the last 2 or 3 weeks, it\u2019s going in the right direction, and nobody likes it. I think that one other difference is that -- compared to some of the other bigger retailers, our inventory is more specific. Like if we get a lot of -- if we have a bunch of air conditioners or a bunch of furniture, it\u2019s -- we may have to hold on to it, but it\u2019s not a whole variety of different things. And so, we -- while we have had some additional markdowns, nothing huge -- no big outsized numbers relative to what we would normally expect. So, a little bit increase, but nothing material.\nBrandon Cheatham: Got you. And so, you\u2019re bringing holiday up a little earlier than you otherwise would. And some of that more seasonal air conditioners and fans you mentioned, you might hold those over to spring time? Is that right?\nRichard Galanti: We will. Yes. That\u2019s easy. And the good news, again, call it, lucky, 2.5 years ago when we acquired Innovel, which is we call Costco Logistics, we added 10 -- or 20 million square feet between the MDOs and DCs. But added 10 million of big space, the 1 million square foot space to the roughly 10 million or 12 million of depot space we have. So, we were -- that was fortuitous in that regard. .\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets.\nKelly Bania: Hi. Thanks. Kelly Bania from BMO. Richard, just wanted to touch on executive penetration. Line item continues to impress. I think it\u2019s the biggest quarterly jump in the model that I can see. But I guess my question is as you look at that kind of cohort of Gold Star customers today, is there anything different about that customer profile, demographics or otherwise that makes you can\u2019t -- makes you think you can\u2019t have the same success in converting those customers up to executive over time?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think -- we think we will. I mean what used to be asked -- the question that used to be asked about millennials or Gen X and then millennials and the Gen Z, we tend to see the same type of trends that are age and, arguably, income-dependent. Also, during these last several years, we\u2019ve continued to get better at talking you into signing up -- selling you on the value of that executive member upfront. So, we\u2019ve seen increased penetration there, too. The other thing, of course, that helps is when we add it to a new country, I think in the past 2 years, we added it to Japan and Korea. And so, we have it, of course, in the U.S., Mexico, Canada and the UK. And so, we\u2019ve already gotten the big countries, if you will, in terms of number of locations. And I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be another country, too, we add it to over time as those countries grow. So no, I think we\u2019ve done a better job of doing it, starting with. Years ago, you came in and we asked you what you wanted and if you said Gold Star, that\u2019s what you got. Now we actually try to share with you what\u2019s the value of it, and we\u2019ve done a better job with that.\nKelly Bania: And just to maybe follow up on the container pricing. I think you mentioned maybe some relief starting there. I guess the question is just, have you learned anything about your business over the past few years, really kind of focusing on discretionary imports and the strategy, the charter ships that you might keep longer term, or do you expect to kind of go back to kind of everything you were doing pre-pandemic from that perspective?\nRichard Galanti: I think the biggest thing we\u2019ve learned is that really from the source of origin of these items. If you go back to even when tariffs were placed in, whatever, \u201816 or \u201817 or whenever that was on China, and there were certain items that were moved from manufacturers in China, those same manufacturers who may have had facilities in other neighboring countries. Where we could and where they could, that was moved to get around some of those tariffs. And so, you learn through that process. We certainly learned through the last couple of years the challenges with containers, not to say that we can change some of it. But I think we try to -- to the extent you can, you try to spread it out a little more. You try to not depend on one port. And certainly, we\u2019ve learned all those things. And we learned that we can continue to make mistakes along the way, too.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Oliver Chen of Cowen.\nOliver Chen: The industry is seeing so much inventory and the wrong kind of inventory. What are your thoughts on the promotions that you\u2019re seeing? And how you\u2019re thinking about pricing? And any thoughts on the nature of your portfolio? You always offer such sharp prices. On inflation at the end of the tunnel, second, Richard, maybe you could elaborate on that. That sounds very nice. And lastly, on...\nRichard Galanti: Hold on. Let\u2019s do one question at a time, so I don\u2019t forget. Yes. Supply becomes more plentiful. There\u2019s more promotions. I remember last year or the last couple of years, again, given shortages in electronics, we saw -- we and the industry saw a lot less promotional activity being afforded retailers from the manufacturers on TVs. There was no need to do that. And we\u2019re starting to see some of those promotional activities come back. Other than that, also, one of the things that we like is our multi-vendor mailer, both the existing one as well as other promotional things, we do like that online and direct. And those had to be changed in some ways because of shortages or allocations of inventory. A lot of times in those types of MVMs, you\u2019ve got a lot of high items like promotional things like TVs as well as huge high sales volume items like paper goods and things like that. And you\u2019re looking at the paper goods as well. There were shortage of those along the way. So, we\u2019ve learned how to change those and maximize them in the ways -- in the best ways we can and figure out how to use those monies -- work with the vendors as well, the suppliers to figure out how to use that money in the best way. And we -- that\u2019s again an iterative evolving process. Second question?\nOliver Chen: Yes. On inflation, just light at the end of the tunnel and some green shoots there that you\u2019re seeing?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Well, again, anecdotally, when we talked to the buyers, they\u2019re starting to see a few examples, whether it\u2019s something like outdoor, patio, furniture or barbecue grill where steel prices are coming down, and we\u2019re reminded by Craig and Ron or the buyers reminded at the budget meeting when prices were going up, make sure you understand why they\u2019re going up. Is it -- what piece of it is raw material costs? What piece of it is freight costs? And when these things come down, you better be on the phone with them calling them saying, when are going to get a reduction? And so I think in part because of our limited selection -- our limited number of SKUs and a huge volume, I think our buyers know pretty darn well a lot of the cost components of these things. And that, I think, bodes well for us. But again, at the end of the day, we are seeing -- I think it is a little light at the end of the tunnel. Certainly, container rates have come down. Container shortages have improved. The port delays have improved, all that things go into it. And as raw material prices come down -- and FX generally helps you and hurts you. When we report a foreign company\u2019s earnings in U.S. dollars, and the currency has gone down 10%, it\u2019s 10% less earnings that we report. But at the same token, since we\u2019re using U.S. dollars in a lot of things, not just in the U.S. to buy different supplies and raw materials from other places, that helps you a little bit. And again, I think it\u2019s -- could something happen tomorrow to change this? Sure. But at least we\u2019re seeing the things going -- starting to go in the right direction. Hopefully, that bodes better for not just us, but everyone.\nOliver Chen: Okay. And lastly, now it\u2019s time to talk about Generation A, analysts. What about the data science team, Richard? I know you hired that team. And what kind of progress or things we should look for there as well as any highlights you want to give us for your digital strategies on the horizon?\nRichard Galanti: You know what, I -- in my old age, I forgot to get any detail on that, but I\u2019ll do that on the next quarter. But generally speaking, it\u2019s been a couple of years since we brought in a VP of Data Analytics, and he has built a sizable team. And a lot of things they\u2019re working on is to have better visibility. As simple as we are, we still need visibility into things that we have done historically, just not on the sales side, but on the operating our business side, greatly reducing -- the intent is to greatly reduce the buyer\u2019s time and doing their own spreadsheets, if you will, and simplifying that. And so, we\u2019re doing a lot of activities like that. And in terms of the data analytics to drive more business, that\u2019s still to come. We think we\u2019re doing okay right now with -- but the first effort of this area is on improving the data that both our data -- our operators, our buyers, our traffic people get.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Greg Melich of Evercore ISI.\nGreg Melich: Two questions. First on gas and then the credit card. On the gas, I guess, I\u2019m curious, it looked like it\u2019s -- well, we know it\u2019s a negative mix shift, really helped ancillary. That was the one thing where gas profit or penny profit was up. Can you just remind us of that dynamic that as gasoline prices fall, how high penny profit can go during that period? And also remind us the traffic-driving relationship to gasoline.\nRichard Galanti: Well, the old story was is when prices -- given that we turn our inventory about every day on average and the average in the U.S. gas stations is like every 8 or 9 days. So, on average, we\u2019re buying -- the other guys buying it four days [Technical Difficulty] four days earlier. So, when prices are going up each day, when spot prices are going up stay, it\u2019s costing us a little more because we bought it today at the highest price versus 4 days ago. I\u2019m being very simple here. And when it\u2019s going down, just the other happens that we make more money when it goes down. I think part of that story has been thrown away because it seems that not only us, but the supermarket retailers and other discount retailers that operate large numbers of gas stations, they\u2019ve been able to use it to -- as prices went up or went -- even went down a little bit, they didn\u2019t go down as fast as perhaps they could have been, which gives us, in our view, an ability to make a little more and still be the most competitive, in fact, in our view, gotten a little wider. So I think overall gasoline as a retail business has gotten more profitable in the last couple, three years. And it\u2019s -- that profitability has been even exacerbated a little bit by what\u2019s going on with inflation and the headline news that prices are skyrocketing. And even when you see gas -- while the gas prices have come down at the pump, it seemed like that lagged -- crude oil coming down. Why isn\u2019t it coming down faster? And so we still are very much, in our view, the most competitive out there. And arguably, we\u2019ve been able to use that to be -- continue to be more competitive elsewhere as well.\nGreg Melich: And is it still 50% roughly that you think go to the club when they get gas?\nRichard Galanti: Well, historically, a little over 50 of every people -- yes. Historically, a little over 50 of every 100 people that filled up with gas came in to shop. That actually right when gas peaked right after the Ukraine-Russia thing, for a couple of weeks there, it went down to like 20%, 25% because people are topping off their tanks for fear that there was going to be a gasoline shortage. If you\u2019re as old as me, you remember the mid-70s. But memory utilization also went up. What we\u2019re seeing now is that a little slightly over 50 or slightly under 50.\nGreg Melich: Got it. So that\u2019s a normal...\nRichard Galanti: But more members are using it. Yes.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And then my last is on the credit card. Just update us on anything you can on the credit card penetration, the behaving of the portfolio, the sort of lift percentage of tender on the card, sort of the lift you get outside of the club with it, just given it seems to be a key part of the renewal rate, I would imagine, continuing to enhance...\nRichard Galanti: Sure. Auto renewal -- it\u2019s not just on the Citi Visa co-brand card. It\u2019s on any Visa card here and on a Mastercard that we worked out a deal with a bank and Mastercard in Canada. So on co-brand, not only the fact that we do it exclusive, which, arguably, gives us purchasing power to lower the merchant fee and to drive the reward to the member. There\u2019s typically co-brand cards, there\u2019s revenue share. So, every time that card is used outside, we share in that revenue. While we pay for some of the rewards, that\u2019s more than offset -- that\u2019s offset by the revenue sharing. So, it continues to be -- fiscal \u201822 is a great year for the card in terms of increasing penetration and increasing rewards to our members and very -- in our view, a very favorable effective merchant fee to us, which we don\u2019t disclose.\nGreg Melich: And the auto renewal is up to what percentage?\nRichard Galanti: Auto renewal, I don\u2019t...\nUnidentified Company Representative: Mid to high-50s in the U.S..\nRichard Galanti: In the -- U.S. number, mid to high-50s signed up for auto renewal.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Benedict of Baird.\nPeter Benedict: You kind of ended your prepared remarks, you said kind of seasonal going well. Maybe you can elaborate on that. Are you talking about fall seasonally, you\u2019re talking Halloween? Just what were you trying to express with that?\nRichard Galanti: Well, part of what I\u2019m trying to express is, is that while inventories were up 26% year-over-year, we\u2019re starting to feel good that they\u2019re going in the right direction with the efforts that we put forth. And part of the -- by the strength is, once we also indicated -- I mentioned in the call or somebody did that seasonal -- we brought in, in some cases, seasonal early just because the nature of the delivery dates, so we want to make sure we add it in. What we\u2019ve seen so far is Halloween is doing well, and Christmas is doing well. And so we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019ve seen in the last few weeks.\nPeter Benedict: Okay. Perfect. And then just kind of maybe a bigger picture, maybe historical question. Just talk to us about how your business has kind of performed in past recessions. And maybe what do you see from your members as you think back? What are the early indications when we\u2019re going into a tougher environment? Is it the business member that starts to slow? Is it traffic? Is it certain categories? I don\u2019t know. Just curious kind of your perspective as we\u2019re in this unique time in the economy.\nRichard Galanti: Look, I don\u2019t remember all of them, but I remember the \u201808, \u201809 one was that at the end of that year, which went from a recession to the Great Recession. It lasted for 4 or 5 years. And that -- as we entered it, and it was pretty quick when it happened. We saw some, like, a slowdown in seasonal things, which were, like, barbecue grills and patio furniture and things like that. Big ticket -- those kind of big-ticket items slowed. And if I go back to my notes, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve talked about we had an extra -- x million dollars of markdowns, just -- to get through that stuff, so we didn\u2019t have it lingering after the first of the calendar year. Other than that, generally speaking, one of the nice things about our model is, is we\u2019ve done well in good times and bad times. And in good times, of course, people have money to spend. And in bad times, people want to save. And in a perverse way, while none of us ever wish COVID on anybody, from a bottom line standpoint, while it impacted some businesses negatively, it\u2019s impacted many more of our businesses positively, and we\u2019ve seen to keep some of that market share. Restaurants are reopening. People -- as what I read that people are still eating more at home than they did pre-COVID. But even within that, we felt that we built some additional market share during that. So I think overall, we did find -- and I think the good news is, even in bad times, we don\u2019t view ourselves as having to be as conservative as perhaps others might be. We don\u2019t take big reductions in buying -- and open to buys or anything in that regard. If I do remember back in \u201809, \u201810 or \u201808, \u201809 with the barbecue grills and patio furniture, midway through the new year, and it was clear it was going to continue to be a recession, whether it was Craig or Jim, prior to Craig or both, the reminder to the buyers was don\u2019t bring down price points. We\u2019ve driven value at greater value and greater price points, if we want to be a little conservative, fine, but don\u2019t think it\u2019s not going to do, go forward based on the assumption that we\u2019re providing the best value out there.\nPeter Benedict: Right. No, no. That\u2019s helpful. I think -- as I recall, maybe your renewal rates actually went up during that Great Recession as well. So definitely\u2026\nRichard Galanti: Yes, they certainly have now -- auto renewal is certainly a piece of that.\nPeter Benedict: Yes. Exactly. Last question just on traffic, Richard. I think, 5% or so on the quarter. I think August maybe was maybe a shade below 3% in the U.S. Just how do you guys think about that? I mean, is there a traffic level that you guys don\u2019t like to see it go below, obviously, more traffic better than less? But just kind of curious how you think about that.\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Part of the challenge of -- in the last couple of years is every time something happens, some of it hits the fan. And it was like the Omicron surge or the Delta surge, and you\u2019ll see things change dramatically in a short period of time. Look, at the end of the day, whenever we see any possibility of something weak, we figure out how to drive sales. And you usually drive sales by greater values, hot items. And that goes back to the comment I made earlier about the multi-vendor mailers. That\u2019s the one thing I think we\u2019re good at, is figuring out how to drive people into the door with hot items, and that\u2019s helped us as well. David here just shared with me. One of the other interesting things, we see more Monday through Thursday shopping than on the weekends -- vice versa. We see less Monday through Thursday and more on the weekends because people are going back to work. But -- so during the week, we go, what\u2019s going on? And then by the end of the week, we go, phew.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners.\nJohn Heinbockel: Do you guys have any sense of demographics by Gold Star versus executive? And the thought being, when you think about the structure going forward, could you leave Gold Star where it is, take executive up and maybe at an executive plus, right, that either has more than 2% or some other features, right, so you\u2019re catering to people through the income spectrum?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. I think we try to -- as you know, John, I think we try to keep things simple. We talk about all kinds of things, but we always come back home and say, let\u2019s do this and keep it simple. One of the issue -- one of the other issues about doing a higher level of membership than the executive is the sales taxability in some states that is currently non-sales taxable, but at a certain level, states say it\u2019s sales taxable, not just the increment, but the whole membership fee. So that\u2019s something we take into account also. At this juncture, I think we still went towards simple.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay. And then secondly, when you think about -- I think somebody asked right about inflation going forward. A lot of what we hear is that it\u2019ll be sticky, right? Higher for longer. As it comes down, what -- how do you think vendors are likely to respond? We\u2019re not going to see list price decreases, right? We\u2019re probably going to see more trade money step up. So, when you think about your participation in that and your ability to take advantage of that, how do you guys think about that?\nRichard Galanti: Well, again, I think, again, in terms of the stickiness, wages are still the culprit. I think, again, we\u2019re in as good a position, if not better than anybody, given that our buying power per item is off the-charts high compared to anybody else and our buyers focus on the detailed components of it. So, there will be stickiness. Read articles every day or on television or in the periodicals, the journal about some CBG companies that just raised their prices, and they\u2019re sticky. Well, we\u2019ll try to unstick them, but I\u2019m sure some of it will stick and some of it won\u2019t. But I think, again, we\u2019re in the best position when you think about we\u2019ve got lots of $50 million and $100 million and $200 million and even higher items and even a handful of billion-dollar SKUs. So we think we are pretty good at figuring that out with our suppliers, not only just to say, hey, the price went down on this commodity or this supply cost component, but also on figuring out how to make things more efficient. I think, we all -- one of the things somebody asked earlier about what have we learned on the freight and trade side, container side, port side, I think we\u2019ve learned through manufacturing as good as we think we are. There are things that I hear at the budget meetings all the time about how on $100 million, $200 million, $500 million SKUs, how they\u2019re taking costs. So -- which right now meant that the price increase was lower than it would have been. But now they took cost out by changing the production line or eliminating some of the insight packaging. And that\u2019s part of ESG as well as you know how to lower the cost. And again, I don\u2019t know if anybody does it as well as we do, given that we\u2019re focused on such bigger volumes of an item.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robby Ohmes of Bank of America Securities.\nRobby Ohmes: Maybe a follow-up on John\u2019s question. So the kind of signs of relief and inflation you\u2019re seeing, can you give an example as -- in the kind of food and sundry side of the business? Are you seeing some relief on the food inflation side?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. I\u2019m getting some help here. Certain commodities, like corn, are coming down. I mentioned -- resin is coming down a little bit. So all these things are impacting a little bit. But in some cases, the supplier are committed at the higher priced -- we work with our suppliers. And the more transparent they are with us, which we feel they are very transparent, we work together on that. In some cases, even when commodity price has gone down fast, if they\u2019ve committed to the next three months at a higher price because they -- we all were fearful it was going even higher, we work with them on that. But -- so I think, again, it\u2019s, at this juncture, anecdotal, and I can\u2019t give you any specific examples.\nRobby Ohmes: Got you. And then just a quick follow-up. I think you mentioned optical was down. I apologize. Has optical been weaker for a while, or what -- or did something change there?\nRichard Galanti: I think the big thing there was a promotion we did a year ago in the quarter. Okay. So we did a big promotion a year ago. And this year, we did -- we do a big promotion on lots of things all the time. But we did a big promotion this year on -- at a slightly later date. And so, we\u2019re now seeing it. Yes. So it\u2019s more timing than anything on that example.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli of Truist Securities.\nScot Ciccarelli: So, Costco tends to put a line in the sand on pricing with some items. Obviously, the hot dog and soda versus chicken offerings, for example, despite today\u2019s inflationary pressures. But your margins are actually holding in pretty well. So I guess, the question is, are there other areas where you\u2019re being even more aggressive than normal on the pricing side? And then, the flip side of that is, what categories are you guys using to maybe harvest some extra margin to offset the presumed margin squeeze from holding the line of sand on pricing?\nRichard Galanti: Lightning just struck me. No. We don\u2019t -- we really don\u2019t look at it that way. I think, the thing I mentioned earlier about there are some businesses that are doing well with margin like gas business on a smaller way -- in the travel business, those things help us be more aggressive in other areas, or as you mentioned, hold the price on the hot dog and the soda a little longer, forever. And -- but at the end of the day, no, I don\u2019t think we necessarily look to find places where we can harvest margin. But we are -- there are different areas. Again, the fresh foods business -- the strength in sales for a two-year period where over two years, you had 30% and 40% -- 20-plus-percent increase each year. The abnormity of the improvement in the bottom line, even now as we\u2019re getting some of that back now, still net-net, were better than we were two years ago. So all those things help that process.\nScot Ciccarelli: But, on a go-forward basis, if you\u2019re really not looking to take any extra margins some other categories, should we presume that margins may actually start to drop on a year-over-year basis?\nRichard Galanti: Well, we don\u2019t provide guidance, but we look at the bottom -- the top line first and how does that impact the bottom line. And historically, years ago was we want to raise margins by lowering prices, but keeping a little of it. That was the old saying, you\u2019re in an inflationary environment, and that changes a little bit. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s all about driving volume. If we can incrementally get another percentage point of comp sales, that does more than any kind of harvesting we would ever want to do, which we don\u2019t do.\nRichard Galanti: Okay. I think that\u2019s it on our end. Thank you very much, everyone. We\u2019re all here to answer some additional questions, and talk to you soon.\nOperator: And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Galanti",
            "content": "Thank you, Lateef, and good afternoon to everyone. I'll start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the Company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the 16 weeks ended this past August 28th. Net income for the quarter was $1.868 billion or $4.20 per diluted share compared to $1.67 billion or $3.76 per diluted share a year ago. Last year's fourth quarter was negatively impacted by an asset write-off of $84 million pretax or $0.14 per diluted share. Net income for the fiscal year totaled $5.84 billion or $13.14 a share compared to $5.01 billion or $11.27 per diluted share the prior fiscal year. Net sales for the fourth quarter increased 15.2% to $70.76 billion as compared to $61.44 billion reported last year in the fourth quarter. On a comparable sales basis from the fourth quarter, U.S. for the 16-week period on a reported basis had comp sales of 15.8%. When you exclude gas inflation and FX -- gas inflation, it'd be 9.6%; Canada, 13.4% reported; 13.7% ex gas and FX; Other International, 2.9% reported and 11.3% ex gas and FX. So all told, total company was reported as 13.7%, and excluding gas and FX, plus 10.4%. Separately, e-commerce, 7.1% reported and again, excluding FX, 8.4%. In terms of the Q4 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 7.2% worldwide and up 5.2% in the U.S. Our average transaction or ticket was up 6.0% worldwide and up 10.0% in the U. S. during the fourth quarter. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by a little over 2%, and gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 5.5%. The best-performing core categories in the quarter were candy, frozen, kiosks, tire, lawn and garden, jewelry, toys, bakery and deli. In terms of ancillary businesses, the best performers were gas and food courts. And in other businesses, travel and business centers performed best relative to the prior fiscal fourth quarter results. Going down the income statement to membership fee income on a reported basis. Membership fee income came in at $1.327 billion or 1.88%. That was up $93 million or 7.5% on a reported basis, again, with weaker foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. That number, excluding the impact of FX, would have been $29.8 million higher, and the 7.5% reported increase would have been a 10% increase. In terms of renewal rates, we again hit all-time highs. At Q4 end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate came in at 92.6%, which is three-tenths of a percentage point higher from 16 weeks earlier at Q3 end when we were at 92.3%. And our worldwide renewal rate came in at the end of the fiscal year at 90.4%, up four-tenths of a percentage point from Q3 end when it was 90.0%. In terms of the number of member households and cardholders, at Q4 end, we ended the fourth quarter with 65.8 million paid household members and 118.9 million cardholders, both up 6.5% from a year earlier. And that 6.5% increase in number of members and cardholders is on about -- just under a 3% increase in the number of locations. During the year, we opened 23 locations on a base that began the year with 815 warehouses. At Q4 end, our paid executive memberships totaled 29.1 million, an increase of 1.2 million or 74, 000 per week during the 16 weeks since third quarter end. Executive members now represent over 44% of our members and just under 72% of our worldwide sales. In terms of membership fees and a possible increase, there are no specific plans regarding a fee increase at this time. We're pleased with our growth in both, top line sales and membership households over the last several quarters, and member loyalty is reflected in increasing member renewal rates. We'll let you know when something is about to happen. Moving on to fourth quarter gross margins. For the quarter, gross margin on a reported basis came in at 10.18% compared -- down 74 basis points from last year's reported gross margin of 10.92%. Now the 74% -- the 74 basis-point year-over-year reduction is on a reported basis. Excluding gas inflation, it was minus 22 basis points. And as we normally do, we actually jot down a few numbers, and then we'll elaborate a little bit more on margin. So, the two columns would be reported year-over-year change and the second one would be ex gas inflation, net year-over-year change. So, the core merchandise margin on a reported basis, minus 67 basis points year-over-year; ex gas inflation, minus 23 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses, the second line item, plus 20 and plus 34; our 2% reward, 0 and minus 5; LIFO, minus 27 and minus 28; and all told, total minus 74 reported, as I mentioned, and minus 22 on -- excluding gas inflation basis. Starting with the core. Core merchandise's contribution to gross margin was lower by 67 basis points year-over-year and by 23 ex gas inflation. The sales mix negatively impacted the core, primarily from the lower sales penetration of total core sales relative to our increasing and outsized gasoline sales. In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in Q4, our core and core margins were lower by 26 basis points. That's pretty much in line with each of the last three quarters when it ranged from minus 39 basis points year-over-year in Q3, minus 28 in Q2 and minus 18 in Q1 on a year-over-year basis. So again, for the quarter, it was minus 26 core-on-core. Ancillary and other businesses gross margin was higher by 20 basis points and higher by 34 basis points ex gas inflation in the quarter. Gas, of course, as well as business centers and travel were better year-over-year, offset somewhat by e-com, pharmacy, food court and optical, but overall, a positive year-over-year change. Our 2% reward, as I mentioned, on an ex gas inflation basis was higher or down 5 -- lower or down 5 basis points, implying higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. In terms of LIFO -- LIFO, as you know, with inflation has been increasing. It was 27 basis points, down year-over-year -- or higher year-over-year. LIFO charge this year on an ex gas inflation basis, 28 basis points higher, and that represented a $223 million charge in the quarter. Recall that our LIFO charges were relatively small in the first part of the year at $14 million; last quarter, in the third quarter, $130 million; and then as I mentioned here, $223 million for the quarter. Moving to SG&A. We showed good results. Reported SG&A came in at 8.53% compared to last year's 9.22% or an improvement of 69 basis points. But again, ex gas inflation, the improvement was still good at 26 basis points lower year-over-year. Again, jotting down a few numbers here, jotting down the numbers on a core operations basis, on a reported basis, that was plus 50 basis points or positive reduction of 50 improvement; ex gas inflation, plus 12 basis points; central, plus 2 and minus 3; stock compensation, plus 2 and plus 1; preopening expense, plus 1 and plus 2; other, plus 14 and plus 14. That gets you down to again on a reported basis, year-over-year SG&A was improved by [69] (ph) basis points; and ex gas inflation by 26 basis points. In terms of the quarter year-over-year, the core operations was, again, better by 12, excluding the impact of gas inflation. Keep in mind, these results include the starting wage increases we instituted in October of 2021, so in the first quarter of this fiscal year -- this past fiscal year, as well as new wage and benefits increases implemented during the third quarter in March of this year as well as the impact of 8 weeks in this quarter as we increase the top-of-scale increase that went into effect July 4th. So, a few increases that we've done this year. And still, we feel pretty good SG&A improvement given our sales strength. Central was lower by 2 basis points and higher by 3 ex gas inflation. Nothing big to talk about there. Again, stock compensation I mentioned. Preopening, I've just -- we've noted that since we now include preopening on the income statement as part of SG&A instead of a separate line item. And other, again, the 14 basis points, recall that that included that last year's write-off in the quarter, totaling $84 million. All told, reported operating income in the fourth quarter increased 10%, coming in at $2.497 billion. A little of that benefit was that asset write-off last year. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $48 million this year versus $52 million last year, relatively similar. Interest income and other for the quarter was lower by $1 million year-over-year, coming in at $67 million this year versus $68 million last year. Interest income was actually higher, but that was offset by unfavorable FX impact, which pretty much offset each other to be roughly flat year-over-year. Overall, reported pretax income was up 10%, coming in at $2.516 billion this year, up from $2.291 billion a year earlier. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 25.4% compared to 26.1% in Q4 last year. The fiscal \u201823 effective tax rate, we estimate, is currently projected to be approximately 26%. Net -- one thing I'll mention, we haven't mentioned in the past. Net income attributable to Costco, that line item was up 12%. Recall that on June 30th this past year, we acquired the 45% minority interest from our JV partner in Taiwan. So, we now own all of Costco Taiwan. As a result, net income attributable to non-controlling interest was better by $14 million in the quarter. The non-controlling interest line will become zero going forward, essentially, a small amount, but pretty much zero. A few other items of note in terms of warehouse expansion. In the fourth quarter, we opened 9 net new warehouses. So for the full year, we opened 26 warehouses, but that included 3 relocations, so a net increase during the year of 23 locations. In the fourth quarter of the 9 we opened, 5 were in the U.S., 2 were in Canada and 1 each in Korea and Japan. In fiscal \u201823, we expect to open 29 new warehouses, including 4 relos, so for a net of 25 new warehouses. These 25 planned net new openings are made up of 15 in the U.S. and 10 in Other International, including our first locations in each of New Zealand and Sweden, and our third and fourth locations in China. Regarding capital expenditures, our fourth quarter Q4 spending CapEx was approximately $1.26 billion. And for the full year, CapEx expenditures was $3.9 billion. Our estimate for the upcoming year fiscal \u201823 CapEx to be approximately the same in the $3.8 billion to $4 billion range. In terms of e-commerce business, e-com sales in the fourth quarter ex FX increased 8.4%. Stronger departments in terms of year-over-year percentage increases were tires, lawn, patio and garden, prescription pharmacy and health and beauty aids. The largest e-com merchandise department in dollars, what we call majors, which includes everything from computers to appliances to TVs to audio, et cetera, was up in the high single digits. And Costco Grocery, including our third-party delivery, two-day dry, fresh and frozen, continue to grow. They were up 20% in the quarter. An update on Costco Logistics. With Costco Logistics, we continue to transition from vendor drop ship to direct ship from our own inventory, particularly in big and bulky items. Overall, this lowers the cost of the merchandise and improves delivery times on service levels to our members, and I'll share with you some statistics to that in a minute. Prior to this acquisition in the U.S., we were completing a few years ago about 2 million big and bulky deliveries and installations per year. In fiscal \u201822, we completed 4.3 million big and bulky deliveries and installation. Previously, all of those 2 million deliveries and installations were made by third parties. In fiscal \u201822, about 70% or a little over 3 million of the 4.3 million were done by us. In the fourth quarter, in fact, that percentage of deliveries and installations done by -- performed by us was 81%. Pre-acquisition, the estimated average days to deliver was above 15 days, and we were working with over 100 delivery partners. Today, our average delivery time for big and bulky is just under 5 days, and we're continuing to work to improve that. And we were down to 8 delivery -- primary delivery partners. A few comments regarding inflation. We've seen minor improvement in a few areas. But all in, pressures from higher commodity prices, higher wages and higher transportation costs and supply chain disruptions. They're still present, but we are seeing just a little light at the end of the tunnel. And if you recall in the third quarter, we indicated that price inflation overall was about 7% plus for us. For the fourth quarter and talking with our merchants, the estimated price inflation overall was about 8%, a little higher on the food and sundries side, a little lower on fresh foods, and both higher and lower on the nonfood side. We're seeing commodities -- some commodities prices coming down, such as gas, steel, beef, relative to a year ago, even some small cost changes in plastics. We're seeing some relief on container pricing. Wages are still the higher thing when we talk to our suppliers. And as we all know, wages still seem to be the one thing that's still relatively higher. But overall, some beginnings of some light at the end of that tunnel. And of course, that could change each week. In all, despite current inflation levels, we believe we continue to remain competitive versus our others and able to raise prices as cost increases, hopefully, of course, a little less than others with whom we compete. Many of you have asked about private label with the recent inflationary environment and what's happening, are people trading down? And of course, our first response, of course, is they're not trading down. They're trading up or certainly trading the same. In terms of Kirkland Signature merchandise penetration, and excluding gas and other businesses that carry the Kirkland name. Kirkland Signature merchandise is up just under 1% in terms of penetration compared to a year ago. Our KS merchandise penetration is about 28% for the year. This is similar to historical trends where it's increasing slowly and steadily over time. So no big dramatic change from the past there. In terms of supply chain. Generally, supply chain has improved a little, including on-time deliveries. We started seeing container prices coming down. First place you see it, of course, is in the spot market and then you'll start to see it hopefully in some other contracts as they continue. No longer any big capacity issues or container shortages. Domestically, port delays have improved. And while the rail strike that was in the news a few weeks ago was thankfully averted. In anticipation of strike, there were some rail ramp closures and delays in restarting that. But the view from our buyers is that this should be eliminated for the most part towards the end of this week. Switching over to inventory levels. Our total inventory at Q4 end was up year-over-year, just -- was up just under 26% year-over-year. At the end of the third quarter, it was up just over 26%. Of the 26% increase, an estimated 10 to 11 percentage points of it is inflation. That's that 8% number. And new warehouse growth, that's that 3% number in terms of unit growth over the last year, but still up year-over-year. Additionally, we're lapping some low stocks in certain departments as a result of last year's high demand, specifically in nonfood areas where last year, we were about 90% of our targeted inventory levels. Food and sundries and fresh are in good shape, we feel. Our weak supply is comparable year-over-year. In terms of nonfood inventories, it's up in certain categories. Again, this is in part a result of being light in certain departments last year, as mentioned earlier. The good news so far, initial seasonal sales seem to be going well, as evidenced in our monthly sales reports. And all told, we would expect the 26% year-over-year increase to start to head down as it has in just the past few weeks a little bit. Lastly, as a reminder, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results for the 5 weeks ending Sunday, October 2nd, this next week on Wednesday -- in two weeks, on Wednesday, October 5th, after the market closes. With that, I will open it up to questions and answers with Lateef. Thanks. Sure. Well, nice try. No, look, at the end of the day, we've always been told and we've told you guys that we're a top line company. We're looking to always drive sales. Certainly, as we've increased member fees historically about every 5, 5.5 years, we've turned around and used it to drive more value. And whenever we do it, we'll do that. I think at the end of the day, it's -- and I also want to point out, of course, if you look at the last 3 increases, on average, they were 5 years and 7 months apart. If you look at June of \u201817, plus 5 years and 7 months, you're talking roughly January \u201823. Now, I'm not suggesting it's January \u201823. I'm just saying it's not there yet anyway. And our view is, is we are confident in our ability to do so and at some point, we will. But it's a question of when, not if. And given the headline of inflation and concerns about recession, we feel quite comfortable driving sales and earnings the way we are right now. And we still have that arrow in our quiver as we go forward. Not at all. I mean, it's steady as she goes in terms of CapEx and what we want to do, and what we want to do with pricing and competitive pricing. And we're not the only company out there, but as we've seen some slight declines in reported gross margin not only this quarter, but in the last several quarters, part of that was just the upsized improvement in margin during the first year of COVID. But we are not -- as you know, we're not shy about doing what we have to do to drive the top line, and we'll continue to do that. Well, other than it was -- it was 16 weeks versus 12 weeks, but are you talking about on a year-over-year basis? I think the outsized thing is just that. I mean, are utilities costs up? Sure. But the outsized thing would be the wage increases. But I'm sure IT is up -- IT is always up a little more as everybody is doing more technology-wise. Well, I think I mentioned -- or we've mentioned when we talked to some of you over the various months was there -- when beef prices skyrocketed, now they're coming down versus a year ago, but when they skyrocket, you see a change. Irrespective of the state of the economy, you see some changes from beef to poultry and those examples. Somebody made -- one of the buyers had made a comment a few months ago that they saw some increased penetration of canned chicken and tuna for that reason. But at the end of the day, we haven't seen any big changes in that. Part of it is hard to see because we -- during these two years of COVID, we enjoyed such strength in big-ticket items. And if -- like consumer electronics, if it's up a little versus up a lot the last two years, incrementally, we know in each of those cases, our numbers relative to industries comparisons are still -- we're still beating the rest of the industry in terms of sales growth. Is the sales growth is slower than it was last year? Yes. It still has a positive plus in front of it, and it's still better than the industry as a whole. Well, I don't have all that detail in front of me. But generally speaking, the thing that was outsized in the biggest way in the first year or so of COVID was fresh. As you'll recall, with fresh, you had virtually no spoilage, and you had much higher labor productivity. So, you had huge -- you had 3-digit improvements in margins there. So, that's the comparison. And we've talked about that in the last several quarters on a year-over-year basis compared to those two years, it's come down as a percent, still up from where it was pre-COVID. Other than that, there's all kinds of things that impact other departments. At the extreme, you have a small business, but in terms of our income statement, travel. Travel is almost a brokerage business where it's all margin -- a lot of it is margin. And that went way down, and now it's improving from where -- it's gone way down. So that helps you a little bit. But there's a lot of moving parts to that. I think fresh was the biggest outlier. Then, during supply chain things and everything else, there were impacts in certain departments or allocations, things like that. There was less -- I'm just shooting from the hip here. There was less promotional activity in consumer electronics because of shortages of chips or electronics. And so, there's a lot of puts and takes. But overall, I would say fresh was the one that was most meaningful in that regard. Sure. Well, two things. Again, if you look sequentially in Q1, it was sub-$20 million; in Q2, it was sub-$40 million -- $30 million something, then $100 million something, then $200 million something. Part of that is, is -- the way we account for it is, at the end of the Q1, when we saw what the trend was, you then estimate what you believe it's going to be for the year, and pro rate a quarter of that or 12 weeks of that to that quarter. And that as it continues to increase, you [proration] (ph) adjusted on a year-to-date basis. So, that skews that a little bit. That's the way we've done it historically in prior inflationary times. The other comment you asked about is it seemed like it'd be even higher in Q4. The fact is, is we, too, thought halfway through the quarter, it would be higher than this. Part of that was if I bifurcated Q4 into the first 8 weeks and the second 8 weeks, the first 8 weeks showed a level of increase that would have required a larger LIFO charge. It seemed to, in some cases, flatten out a little bit during the last several weeks of the quarter, which meant that it came down from what our expectation was. So again, I think that is consistent with I mentioned about we're seeing a little light at the end of the tunnel. I'm not just -- and there's little [Technical Difficulty] some of the buyers about a couple of items going down in price. And you can rest assured that our partners are calling the suppliers. As you said, the price went up because of steel prices. Well, steel prices are down. What gives? And so we'll continue to do that. But it's a slow road. And -- but we are, again, seeing a little bit of improvement at least in the second half of the fourth quarter. And we'll see where it goes from here. Sure. Well, first of all, without being too specific, there's a decent chunk in there that I would call deep freeze from last year. My example I've used when talking to people is the Christmas trees that retail for $150 to $400. And they came in after Christmas or essentially after Christmas. And the good news is, is that they don't really change in style. And they're now -- and if you go to Costco, you're going to see it on the floor. And the -- if you add in the cost of holding them and a little cost of interest, I think they're still a little cheaper than the ones we added to the inventory this year. So in a perverse way, that one didn't hurt us that example other than we don't like to have extra inventory. And so, there are some seasonal things that came in late. Probably a bigger piece of the delta is us building up inventory, particularly on big and bulky and fulfillment -- both e-com fulfillment and big and bulky. The last part is early holiday. We did consciously bring in some stuff. Part of it was not knowing what was happening with supply chain and how many weeks of delay at each item was. We bought stuff in consciously a little early. And then as I mentioned, supply chain has improved a little. That's helped you. So again, there's things that have helped it and hurt it -- increased it or reduced it. The other thing that's increased a little bit, even some things like seasonal things like air conditioning and fans, which was -- we had a very strong season, but there were some delays in getting that stuff in. That will be a small impact from a seasonal standpoint going forward. But net-net, I think that while the 26% number was relatively same at year-over-year Q3 end -- Q3 year-over-year and at Q4 end, again, in talking with Ron and Claudine and the merchants, and again, seeing what we've seen just in the last 2 or 3 weeks, it's going in the right direction, and nobody likes it. I think that one other difference is that -- compared to some of the other bigger retailers, our inventory is more specific. Like if we get a lot of -- if we have a bunch of air conditioners or a bunch of furniture, it's -- we may have to hold on to it, but it's not a whole variety of different things. And so, we -- while we have had some additional markdowns, nothing huge -- no big outsized numbers relative to what we would normally expect. So, a little bit increase, but nothing material. We will. Yes. That's easy. And the good news, again, call it, lucky, 2.5 years ago when we acquired Innovel, which is we call Costco Logistics, we added 10 -- or 20 million square feet between the MDOs and DCs. But added 10 million of big space, the 1 million square foot space to the roughly 10 million or 12 million of depot space we have. So, we were -- that was fortuitous in that regard. . Well, I think -- we think we will. I mean what used to be asked -- the question that used to be asked about millennials or Gen X and then millennials and the Gen Z, we tend to see the same type of trends that are age and, arguably, income-dependent. Also, during these last several years, we've continued to get better at talking you into signing up -- selling you on the value of that executive member upfront. So, we've seen increased penetration there, too. The other thing, of course, that helps is when we add it to a new country, I think in the past 2 years, we added it to Japan and Korea. And so, we have it, of course, in the U.S., Mexico, Canada and the UK. And so, we've already gotten the big countries, if you will, in terms of number of locations. And I'm sure there'll be another country, too, we add it to over time as those countries grow. So no, I think we've done a better job of doing it, starting with. Years ago, you came in and we asked you what you wanted and if you said Gold Star, that's what you got. Now we actually try to share with you what's the value of it, and we've done a better job with that. I think the biggest thing we've learned is that really from the source of origin of these items. If you go back to even when tariffs were placed in, whatever, \u201816 or \u201817 or whenever that was on China, and there were certain items that were moved from manufacturers in China, those same manufacturers who may have had facilities in other neighboring countries. Where we could and where they could, that was moved to get around some of those tariffs. And so, you learn through that process. We certainly learned through the last couple of years the challenges with containers, not to say that we can change some of it. But I think we try to -- to the extent you can, you try to spread it out a little more. You try to not depend on one port. And certainly, we've learned all those things. And we learned that we can continue to make mistakes along the way, too. Hold on. Let's do one question at a time, so I don't forget. Yes. Supply becomes more plentiful. There's more promotions. I remember last year or the last couple of years, again, given shortages in electronics, we saw -- we and the industry saw a lot less promotional activity being afforded retailers from the manufacturers on TVs. There was no need to do that. And we're starting to see some of those promotional activities come back. Other than that, also, one of the things that we like is our multi-vendor mailer, both the existing one as well as other promotional things, we do like that online and direct. And those had to be changed in some ways because of shortages or allocations of inventory. A lot of times in those types of MVMs, you've got a lot of high items like promotional things like TVs as well as huge high sales volume items like paper goods and things like that. And you're looking at the paper goods as well. There were shortage of those along the way. So, we've learned how to change those and maximize them in the ways -- in the best ways we can and figure out how to use those monies -- work with the vendors as well, the suppliers to figure out how to use that money in the best way. And we -- that's again an iterative evolving process. Second question? Yes. Well, again, anecdotally, when we talked to the buyers, they're starting to see a few examples, whether it's something like outdoor, patio, furniture or barbecue grill where steel prices are coming down, and we're reminded by Craig and Ron or the buyers reminded at the budget meeting when prices were going up, make sure you understand why they're going up. Is it -- what piece of it is raw material costs? What piece of it is freight costs? And when these things come down, you better be on the phone with them calling them saying, when are going to get a reduction? And so I think in part because of our limited selection -- our limited number of SKUs and a huge volume, I think our buyers know pretty darn well a lot of the cost components of these things. And that, I think, bodes well for us. But again, at the end of the day, we are seeing -- I think it is a little light at the end of the tunnel. Certainly, container rates have come down. Container shortages have improved. The port delays have improved, all that things go into it. And as raw material prices come down -- and FX generally helps you and hurts you. When we report a foreign company's earnings in U.S. dollars, and the currency has gone down 10%, it's 10% less earnings that we report. But at the same token, since we're using U.S. dollars in a lot of things, not just in the U.S. to buy different supplies and raw materials from other places, that helps you a little bit. And again, I think it's -- could something happen tomorrow to change this? Sure. But at least we're seeing the things going -- starting to go in the right direction. Hopefully, that bodes better for not just us, but everyone. You know what, I -- in my old age, I forgot to get any detail on that, but I'll do that on the next quarter. But generally speaking, it's been a couple of years since we brought in a VP of Data Analytics, and he has built a sizable team. And a lot of things they're working on is to have better visibility. As simple as we are, we still need visibility into things that we have done historically, just not on the sales side, but on the operating our business side, greatly reducing -- the intent is to greatly reduce the buyer's time and doing their own spreadsheets, if you will, and simplifying that. And so, we're doing a lot of activities like that. And in terms of the data analytics to drive more business, that's still to come. We think we're doing okay right now with -- but the first effort of this area is on improving the data that both our data -- our operators, our buyers, our traffic people get. Well, the old story was is when prices -- given that we turn our inventory about every day on average and the average in the U.S. gas stations is like every 8 or 9 days. So, on average, we're buying -- the other guys buying it four days [Technical Difficulty] four days earlier. So, when prices are going up each day, when spot prices are going up stay, it's costing us a little more because we bought it today at the highest price versus 4 days ago. I'm being very simple here. And when it's going down, just the other happens that we make more money when it goes down. I think part of that story has been thrown away because it seems that not only us, but the supermarket retailers and other discount retailers that operate large numbers of gas stations, they've been able to use it to -- as prices went up or went -- even went down a little bit, they didn't go down as fast as perhaps they could have been, which gives us, in our view, an ability to make a little more and still be the most competitive, in fact, in our view, gotten a little wider. So I think overall gasoline as a retail business has gotten more profitable in the last couple, three years. And it's -- that profitability has been even exacerbated a little bit by what's going on with inflation and the headline news that prices are skyrocketing. And even when you see gas -- while the gas prices have come down at the pump, it seemed like that lagged -- crude oil coming down. Why isn't it coming down faster? And so we still are very much, in our view, the most competitive out there. And arguably, we've been able to use that to be -- continue to be more competitive elsewhere as well. Well, historically, a little over 50 of every people -- yes. Historically, a little over 50 of every 100 people that filled up with gas came in to shop. That actually right when gas peaked right after the Ukraine-Russia thing, for a couple of weeks there, it went down to like 20%, 25% because people are topping off their tanks for fear that there was going to be a gasoline shortage. If you're as old as me, you remember the mid-70s. But memory utilization also went up. What we're seeing now is that a little slightly over 50 or slightly under 50. But more members are using it. Yes. Sure. Auto renewal -- it's not just on the Citi Visa co-brand card. It's on any Visa card here and on a Mastercard that we worked out a deal with a bank and Mastercard in Canada. So on co-brand, not only the fact that we do it exclusive, which, arguably, gives us purchasing power to lower the merchant fee and to drive the reward to the member. There's typically co-brand cards, there's revenue share. So, every time that card is used outside, we share in that revenue. While we pay for some of the rewards, that's more than offset -- that's offset by the revenue sharing. So, it continues to be -- fiscal \u201822 is a great year for the card in terms of increasing penetration and increasing rewards to our members and very -- in our view, a very favorable effective merchant fee to us, which we don't disclose. Auto renewal, I don't... In the -- U.S. number, mid to high-50s signed up for auto renewal. Well, part of what I'm trying to express is, is that while inventories were up 26% year-over-year, we're starting to feel good that they're going in the right direction with the efforts that we put forth. And part of the -- by the strength is, once we also indicated -- I mentioned in the call or somebody did that seasonal -- we brought in, in some cases, seasonal early just because the nature of the delivery dates, so we want to make sure we add it in. What we've seen so far is Halloween is doing well, and Christmas is doing well. And so we're encouraged by what we've seen in the last few weeks. Look, I don't remember all of them, but I remember the \u201808, \u201809 one was that at the end of that year, which went from a recession to the Great Recession. It lasted for 4 or 5 years. And that -- as we entered it, and it was pretty quick when it happened. We saw some, like, a slowdown in seasonal things, which were, like, barbecue grills and patio furniture and things like that. Big ticket -- those kind of big-ticket items slowed. And if I go back to my notes, I'm sure we've talked about we had an extra -- x million dollars of markdowns, just -- to get through that stuff, so we didn't have it lingering after the first of the calendar year. Other than that, generally speaking, one of the nice things about our model is, is we've done well in good times and bad times. And in good times, of course, people have money to spend. And in bad times, people want to save. And in a perverse way, while none of us ever wish COVID on anybody, from a bottom line standpoint, while it impacted some businesses negatively, it's impacted many more of our businesses positively, and we've seen to keep some of that market share. Restaurants are reopening. People -- as what I read that people are still eating more at home than they did pre-COVID. But even within that, we felt that we built some additional market share during that. So I think overall, we did find -- and I think the good news is, even in bad times, we don't view ourselves as having to be as conservative as perhaps others might be. We don't take big reductions in buying -- and open to buys or anything in that regard. If I do remember back in \u201809, \u201810 or \u201808, \u201809 with the barbecue grills and patio furniture, midway through the new year, and it was clear it was going to continue to be a recession, whether it was Craig or Jim, prior to Craig or both, the reminder to the buyers was don't bring down price points. We've driven value at greater value and greater price points, if we want to be a little conservative, fine, but don't think it's not going to do, go forward based on the assumption that we're providing the best value out there. Yes, they certainly have now -- auto renewal is certainly a piece of that. Yes. Part of the challenge of -- in the last couple of years is every time something happens, some of it hits the fan. And it was like the Omicron surge or the Delta surge, and you'll see things change dramatically in a short period of time. Look, at the end of the day, whenever we see any possibility of something weak, we figure out how to drive sales. And you usually drive sales by greater values, hot items. And that goes back to the comment I made earlier about the multi-vendor mailers. That's the one thing I think we're good at, is figuring out how to drive people into the door with hot items, and that's helped us as well. David here just shared with me. One of the other interesting things, we see more Monday through Thursday shopping than on the weekends -- vice versa. We see less Monday through Thursday and more on the weekends because people are going back to work. But -- so during the week, we go, what's going on? And then by the end of the week, we go, phew. Yes. I think we try to -- as you know, John, I think we try to keep things simple. We talk about all kinds of things, but we always come back home and say, let's do this and keep it simple. One of the issue -- one of the other issues about doing a higher level of membership than the executive is the sales taxability in some states that is currently non-sales taxable, but at a certain level, states say it's sales taxable, not just the increment, but the whole membership fee. So that's something we take into account also. At this juncture, I think we still went towards simple. Well, again, I think, again, in terms of the stickiness, wages are still the culprit. I think, again, we're in as good a position, if not better than anybody, given that our buying power per item is off the-charts high compared to anybody else and our buyers focus on the detailed components of it. So, there will be stickiness. Read articles every day or on television or in the periodicals, the journal about some CBG companies that just raised their prices, and they're sticky. Well, we'll try to unstick them, but I'm sure some of it will stick and some of it won't. But I think, again, we're in the best position when you think about we've got lots of $50 million and $100 million and $200 million and even higher items and even a handful of billion-dollar SKUs. So we think we are pretty good at figuring that out with our suppliers, not only just to say, hey, the price went down on this commodity or this supply cost component, but also on figuring out how to make things more efficient. I think, we all -- one of the things somebody asked earlier about what have we learned on the freight and trade side, container side, port side, I think we've learned through manufacturing as good as we think we are. There are things that I hear at the budget meetings all the time about how on $100 million, $200 million, $500 million SKUs, how they're taking costs. So -- which right now meant that the price increase was lower than it would have been. But now they took cost out by changing the production line or eliminating some of the insight packaging. And that's part of ESG as well as you know how to lower the cost. And again, I don't know if anybody does it as well as we do, given that we're focused on such bigger volumes of an item. Yes. I'm getting some help here. Certain commodities, like corn, are coming down. I mentioned -- resin is coming down a little bit. So all these things are impacting a little bit. But in some cases, the supplier are committed at the higher priced -- we work with our suppliers. And the more transparent they are with us, which we feel they are very transparent, we work together on that. In some cases, even when commodity price has gone down fast, if they've committed to the next three months at a higher price because they -- we all were fearful it was going even higher, we work with them on that. But -- so I think, again, it's, at this juncture, anecdotal, and I can't give you any specific examples. I think the big thing there was a promotion we did a year ago in the quarter. Okay. So we did a big promotion a year ago. And this year, we did -- we do a big promotion on lots of things all the time. But we did a big promotion this year on -- at a slightly later date. And so, we're now seeing it. Yes. So it's more timing than anything on that example. Lightning just struck me. No. We don't -- we really don't look at it that way. I think, the thing I mentioned earlier about there are some businesses that are doing well with margin like gas business on a smaller way -- in the travel business, those things help us be more aggressive in other areas, or as you mentioned, hold the price on the hot dog and the soda a little longer, forever. And -- but at the end of the day, no, I don't think we necessarily look to find places where we can harvest margin. But we are -- there are different areas. Again, the fresh foods business -- the strength in sales for a two-year period where over two years, you had 30% and 40% -- 20-plus-percent increase each year. The abnormity of the improvement in the bottom line, even now as we're getting some of that back now, still net-net, were better than we were two years ago. So all those things help that process. Well, we don't provide guidance, but we look at the bottom -- the top line first and how does that impact the bottom line. And historically, years ago was we want to raise margins by lowering prices, but keeping a little of it. That was the old saying, you're in an inflationary environment, and that changes a little bit. But at the end of the day, it's all about driving volume. If we can incrementally get another percentage point of comp sales, that does more than any kind of harvesting we would ever want to do, which we don't do. Okay. I think that's it on our end. Thank you very much, everyone. We're all here to answer some additional questions, and talk to you soon."

At this time, all participant\u2019s are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nBob Nelson: Thank you, Erica, and good afternoon to everyone. This is Bob Nelson, Senior VP of Finance and Investor Relations here at Costco. Thank you for dialing in into today's conference call to review our third quarter fiscal year 2022 operating results. Before we begin, a couple of housekeeping items to take care of. First, as you now have surmised, Richard is not with us today. He is doing great and wishes he could be on the call. He is in Italy with his family on a rescheduled vacation that was canceled early in the pandemic. He wanted me to pass along his best to everyone and in his absence I will be filling in for him today. Secondly, and before we get into the details of today's earnings results, I need to read our safe harbor disclosure. Let's begin. These discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and our performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. Okay. With that out of the way, let's get to it. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the 12 weeks ended this past May 8th. Net income for the quarter was $1.353 billion, $3.04 per diluted share. The reported $3.04 included a one-time $77 million pre-tax charge, $0.13 per diluted share for incremental benefits awarded under the new employee agreement effective this past March 14th. Last year's third quarter net income was $1.22 billion, $2.75 per diluted share, which included $57 million pre-tax or $0.09 per diluted share for costs incurred primarily from COVID-19 premium wages. In terms of this year's $77 million pre-tax charge, this was in conjunction with our new employee agreement, again, effective this past March 14th and was primarily to adjust our benefit accrual to account for one additional day of vacation, which is awarded to each employee immediately. The continuing impacts of the wage and benefit enhancements are reflected in SG&A and margin for this quarter and will be in for -- as well as for subsequent quarters. Net income for the first 36 weeks of fiscal 2022 was $3.98 billion, $8.94 per diluted share, and that compares to $3.34 billion or $7.51 per diluted share last year. Now -- let's now review the metrics of our P&L. As always, starting with sales, net sales for the third quarter increased 16.3% to $51.61 billion and that compares to $44.38 billion reported last year in Q3. In terms of comparable sales for the third quarter, for the 12 weeks on a reported basis, the US was better or up by 16.6%, Canada better by 15.2%. Other international, up 5.7% and total company, again, up 14.9%. Our e-comm business in the third quarter reported better by 7.4% versus a year ago. For the 12 weeks, excluding the benefit of gas inflation and the headwinds of FX the US came in at up 10.7%, Canada better by 12.8%, other international up $9.1 million, and on a total company basis, ex gas inflation and FX headwinds better by 10.8%, and e-commerce just below 8% at 7.9% for the quarter. In terms of Q3 comp metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 6.8% worldwide and up 5.6% in the US. Our average transaction was up 7.6% worldwide and up 10.4% in the US during the quarter. And foreign currencies relative to the US dollar negatively impacted sales by just a little over 1% and our gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales in the quarter, just a little bit more than 5%. The best performing categories in Q3 were candy, sundries, tires, toys, jewelry, kiosks, home furnishings, apparel, bakery and deli. Underperforming departments were liquor, office, sporting goods and hardware, all of which were quite strong a year ago. In terms of other business sales, the best performers came in from gasoline, travel, food courts and our business centers. So overall, our sales grew nicely in the quarter. And for the most part, were pretty broad-based. Moving down the income statement to membership fee income reported in Q3, $984 million or 1.91 as a percentage of sales, compared to last year's $901 million or 2.03 as a percentage of sales. That's up $83 million year-over-year or a 9.2% increase. And excluding headwinds from FX of about $10.6 million, membership was up, 10.4% in the quarter. In terms of renewal rates, we hit an all-time -- we hit all-time highs. At Q3 end, our US and Canada renewal rate was 92.3%, up 0.3% from the 12 weeks earlier at Q2 end. And the worldwide rate came in at 90% for the first time in company history, and that's up 0.4% from what we reported at Q2 end. Renewal rates continue to benefit from the increased penetration of both auto renewals and more executive members. And in addition to that, higher first year member renewal rates than what we have historically seen. In terms of member counts, number of member households and cardholders at Q3 end, we ended Q3 with 64.4 million paid households and 116.6 million cardholders, both of those up over 6%, compared to a year ago. At Q3 end, our paid executive memberships were 27.9 million, and that's an increase of just about 800,000 during the 12 weeks since Q2 end. Executive members now represent over 43% of our member base and over 71% of our worldwide sales. Now before I move on, I want to take just a minute and address the question that we've been getting a lot recently regarding the timing of the potential membership fee increase. Historically, we've raised fees every five to six years with the last three increases coming on average at about the 5.5-year time frame, and our last increase coming in June of 2017. As we approach this 5.5-year mark, there will be more discussions with Craig, Ron and the executive team. But for today, we have nothing more specific to report in terms of timing. In addition, given the current macro environment, the historically high inflation and the burden it is having on our members and all consumers in general, we think increasing our membership fee today ahead of our typical timing is not the right time. We will let you know, however, when that changes. Okay. Moving on, along the P&L, let's take a look at gross margins. Our reported gross margins in the third quarter were lower year-over-year by 99 basis points. This year coming in at 10.19% as a percentage of sales, and that compares to last year\u2019s 11.18% that we reported a year ago, so the 99 basis points down year-over-year. And excluding the negative impact of gas inflation, we would have been down 53 basis points. So if you would for me and as normal, please jot down the following for our gross margin metrics. And again, as usual, two columns, the first column being reported gross margin, the second column being gross margin and without the impact of gas inflation. There are six rows, the first row being merchandised core; second, ancillary and other business; the third row, 2% rewards; followed by LIFO; other; and then total. So in terms of our core merchandise margins on a reported basis, they were down 87 basis points versus last year, down 46 basis points ex-gas, ancillary and other plus six reported and plus 18 ex-gas, 2% rewards plus eight and plus three; LIFO, minus 25 basis points on a reported basis and minus 27% ex gas inflation; and finally, other minus one with and without gas. So again, in total, down 99 reported, down 53 excluding the impact of gas inflation. A little color, more color on gross margins, starting with core merchandise. The core merchandise contribution to gross margin was lower by 46 basis points, ex gas inflation in the quarter. Sales mix negatively impacted the core, primarily from the lower sales penetration of total core sales relative to our gasoline sales, which were very strong in the quarter. In terms of the core margins on their own sales in Q3, our core-on-core margins were lower by 39 basis points. Approximately two-thirds of this coming from fresh foods. Fresh experienced a very difficult compare versus last year when the extraordinary volumes produced lower D&D and higher labor productivity a year ago. Also contributing to the fresh decline this quarter were higher raw material costs and higher labor costs due to our new wages. Ancillary and other business gross margin, again, higher by six reported higher by 18 basis points ex gas inflation. Gas, travel and business centers were better year-over-year, offset somewhat by e-com, pharmacy and optical. Again, 2% rewards higher by eight reported higher by three ex gas. LIFO, minus 25 and minus 27 ex gas as we recorded $130 million charge in the quarter for LIFO and other was minus 1 basis point, both with and ex gas inflation. This included items from both years. Last year, we had $14 million of COVID expenses, primarily premium wages within gross margin. This year, we had a onetime charge discussed at the beginning of the call, $20 million of the $77 million, of which related to gross margin. The net result of these two items, again, minus 1 basis point. And while we continue to mitigate the impact of price increases as best as we can, we remain comfortable in our ability to pass through higher costs while providing great value to our members. Moving to SG&A. We showed good results. Our reported SG&A in the third quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 84 basis points, coming in at 8.62% and that compares to last year's reported 9.46% SG&A figure. That's, again, 84 basis points lower or better and 44 basis points, excluding the impact of gas inflation. Again, if you jot down the following for our SG&A matrix, again, two columns, the first column being reported SG&A; the second column, SG&A ex the impact of gas inflation. And we have five rows, the first row operations, second row central, third row stock compensation expense, third -- or fourth through other and then total is the fifth row. In terms of our operations on a reported basis, SG&A was better by 68 basis points and ex the benefit of gas inflation better by 35. Central better by 15 reported, better by 10 ex gas. Stock compensation better by two reported, better by one ex-gas and other minus one and minus twp ex gas. Again, all totaled 84 basis points lower or better and 44 excluding the benefit of gas inflation. In Q3 year-over-year, the core operations component of SG&A was better by 68%, again, 35 ex gas. Keep in mind, this result includes the starting wage increase we instituted this past October, as well as eight weeks of the new wage and benefit increases just implemented during Q3 on October 14 of this year. Central was better by 15 and better by 10 without gas. Stock comp plus two, plus one without gas and again, other minus one basis point, minus two without gas inflation. Similar to gross margin, this included items from both years. Last year, we had $44 million of COVID expenses. And this year, we had a one-time charge again discussed at the beginning of the call, $57 million of the $77 million, which related to SG&A. The net result of these two items, again, minus one reported, minus two ex gas inflation. So all told, reported operating income in Q3 of this year increased 8%, coming in at $1.791 billion. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $35 million this year versus $40 million last year. And interest income and other for the quarter was higher by 44 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to favorable FX. Overall, pre-tax profit \u2013 pre-tax income came in for the quarter at up 11%, coming in at $1.827 billion, and that compares to $1.65 billion, which we reported a year ago. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q3 was 24.9% that compares to 25.2% in Q3 last year. Overall, for the year, our effective tax rate is currently projected to be between 26% and 27%. A few other items of note, warehouse expansion. In Q3, we opened one net new warehouse plus two relocations. Q3 year-to-date, we have opened 17 warehouses, including three relocations, for a net of 14 new warehouses so far this fiscal year. For the remainder of the fiscal year and in Q4, we expect to open an additional 10 new warehouses, which will put us at 27 for the year, including three relocations and for a net of 24 net new warehouses for all of fiscal year 2022. The 24 new warehouses by market are 14 in the US, two in Canada and one each in Korea, Japan, Australia, Mexico, Spain, France, China and our first opening in New Zealand, which will occur in August of this year. In terms of the new openings this year, this is four fewer than what we projected in Q2. Two of the four were impacted by supply chain issues related to electrical equipment. And the other two have been delayed due to third-party site development issues. All four of these buildings are now scheduled to open by the end of calendar November this fall. Incidentally, there are three in the US and one in Australia that were delayed. The one net new opening in Q3 was a business center located in San Marcos, California. And the first of the 10 scheduled to open in Q4 opened this past week in Riverton, Utah, bringing our worldwide total to 830 Costco's as of today and around the world. Regarding CapEx, the Q3, 2022 spend was approximately $854 million. Our full year CapEx spend is estimated for the year to be just shy of about $4 billion. In terms of our e-comm business, comm sales in Q3, ex-FX increased 7.9%. This is on top of the 38% increase a year ago. Stronger departments in the quarter were special order, patio and garden, jewelry and home furnishings. Our largest e-comm merchandise department managers, which includes consumer electronics, appliances, TVs, was up a little bit better than mid-single digits on a very strong sales increase a year earlier. And Costco grocery, including our third-party delivery, two-day dry, fresh and frozen continues to grow, up low double digits in the quarter. An update on Costco Logistics. Costco Logistics continues to drive big and bulky sales for us. We averaged more than 58,000 stops a week in the third quarter. For the full year, we estimate total deliveries will be up 23% and will exceed $3 million. With Logistics, we continue to transition from vendor drop ship to direct ship from our own inventory, particularly in big and bulky items. Overall, this lowers the cost of merchandise and improved delivery times and service levels for our members. Okay. A few -- now a few comments regarding inflation. First of all, it continues. Pressures from higher commodity prices, higher wages, higher transportation costs and supply chain disruptions all still in play. For Q1, we estimate price inflation was in the 4.5% to 5% range. For Q2, we had estimated 6%-ish, if you will. And for Q3 and talking to our merchants, estimated price inflation was in the 7%-ish range. However, we did see inflation in fresh foods come in slightly lower in Q3 versus Q2 a year ago as we began cycling high meat prices. We believe our solid sales increases and relatively consistent margins show that we have continued to strike the right balance in passing on higher costs. Switching over to inventory for a minute. Our total inventory in Q3 was up 26% year-over-year versus up 19% in Q2, a couple of high-level comments regarding inventory. A material component of the increase year-over-year is inflation rather than unit growth. We continue to expand open new locations, 20 new in the last 12 months. We are lapping some low stocks in certain departments as a result of last year's high demand. And we are purposely building inventory in our e-comm business, primarily in big and bulky categories as mentioned earlier in the call. Food and sundries and fresh is in very good shape. Our weak supply is comparable year-over-year. Nonfood inventories are up in certain categories. This is in part a result of being light in certain departments last year, specifically, seasonal lawn and garden, TVs, appliances and sporting goods. Otherwise, we are a little heavy in small appliances and domestics, primarily due to late arriving merchandise this year. In addition, we have a few hundred million dollars of extra inventory in both late arriving holiday merchandise from last season, which we're storing until this fall and some buy in merchandise to ensure proper inventory levels in the face of these ongoing supply chain issues. Speaking with Craig, Ron and Claudine Adamo, our new Head of Merchandising, we feel good about our current inventory levels. The additional inventory we're carrying is in the right departments, and they feel good about our ability to move it. A quick update on China. Our first opening in China located in Minhang, Shanghai was closed for the last six weeks of the third quarter. That closure had a negative impact in the quarter of approximately $35 million in sales. As of May 18, we're happy to report that building is back open, but operating under restrictions on the number of people that can be in the building at one time, among other cleaning and operating restrictions. Our second building in Suzhou, which opened in December of this last December, was largely -- has largely avoided the lockdowns and restrictions to this point. We're currently targeting an opening date of this December for our third Shanghai building in Pudong. The timing, although will somewhat depend on the area remaining open for the next several months and not being more negatively impacted by lockdowns Four additional China buildings are currently underway and planned. It was opening dates in the next two years. These would be our first China openings outside of Shanghai. I believe we have -- of those four, one is in fiscal 2023 and three in fiscal 2024. As a reminder, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results for the four weeks ending Sunday, May 29, this next week on Thursday, June 2, after market close. This is a day later than our traditional Wednesday release due to the Memorial Day holiday. Before wrapping up, a quick shout out to the 300,000 worldwide Costco employees around the globe, and the excellent work and proactive effort they give each day to navigate during these most challenging environment. Our merchants and operators are the best in the business, and their hard work is reflected in our strong operating results. Finally, I want to address some incorrect information floating around on social media and a few other media outlets claiming that we have increased the price of our $1.50 hot dog and soda combinations sold in our food courts. Let me just say the price when we introduced the hot dog/ soda combo in the mid-80s was $1.50. The price today is $1.50, and we have no plans to increase the price at this time. With that, I will turn it back over to Erika and open it up for Q&A. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: Hey, Bob. How are you doing?\nBob Nelson: Good.\nSimeon Gutman: Who's going to whisper the answers, if you're the one doing all of the...\nBob Nelson: I got help.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. I hear it. Can you tell on the core on core margin ex gas, it looks like underlying run rate got a little worse, which I don't think is a big surprise given what we're hearing out there. You mentioned in the core on core, the perishable year-over-year -- but is it safe that is it transport, or is it \u2013 there's some markdowns on erratic inventory coming in? Can you talk a little bit about what's happening there? Thanks.\nBob Nelson: Yes. On the fresh side, we literally had no D&D last year. And we had very high labor productivity because of the pounds that we were going \u2013 that we were processing, if you will. So I think we've kept a lot of that leverage actually. We're way above pre-pandemic levels. It's just that was extraordinary last year. So \u2013 and I think we'll keep some of that. But it's not all that. And then a little bit of it is, like I said, raw material costs this year. I mean, those eventually make their way into our \u2013 the price of our goods. But as you know, we're not the first one to go up when we have higher costs. I think just recently, it may have been after the end of the quarter, we reluctantly, but we took up the price of our muffins and our croissants, I think $1 as the price of a lot of those raw materials have continued to escalate to two and three and four times what they were last year. So that's essentially what's going on there.\nSimeon Gutman: Got it. Maybe my follow-up is anything happening on trip consolidation, items per trip rising? Anything that, I'm sure this is a question you're ready for.\nBob Nelson: Yeah. Honestly, we're not seeing a lot of change in our throughput in the buildings. I mean, we're seeing a lot of traffic. We're not seeing a lot of \u2013 we're not seeing trade down really. We're seeing a little bit of shift in where people are spending their money. Last year, there was more stuff for the home and that \u2013 and this year, it's more sales in tickets and restaurants and travel and tires and gas and things of that nature. But we're still holding our own in areas like apparel and furniture and jewelry, TVs, appliances. All those departments are showing good decent sales growth on top of pretty good numbers a year ago. I would say overall, there might be a very small amount in terms of the number of items in the basket this year. A little less than last year because there was more trip consolidation going on a year ago, I think, during COVID. But overall, I think we feel pretty good about what we're seeing and how our members are shopping.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Thanks Bob. Take care.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.\nChuck Grom: Okay. Thanks a lot. Good job, Bob, today. Just curious, Craig's view on balancing the desire to show value, particularly lately as the macro backdrop continues to get more uncertain, while also passing on some price increases like you articulated, inflation up anywhere between 5% to 7%. But we know, in some cases, the pressures are much higher. So, just curious where Craig is on that balance?\nBob Nelson: Well, look, I think we always want to be the best value in the marketplace. And to the extent that we continue to show that, I think it's easier for us to pass on higher pricing, or higher freight costs, or raw material cost, assuming that we show that value in the marketplace. And that's what it's all about really. And I think we feel good about it. I mean, our most recent shops against who we watch most closely have not changed. And we're every bit as competitive as we've been, notwithstanding the fact we have taken some prices up in certain areas in food, in sundries and in fresh foods.\nChuck Grom: Okay. Great. And then on the core on core, you talked about two-third being fresh. Just wonder if you could just give us some color on some of the discretionary categories?\nBob Nelson: Well, I think the balance was slightly more in nonfoods than in foods in terms of the remaining third of the lower margins. I'm not sure I have specifics right now on certain specific categories. I mean, again, it's not really a category, we're an item business, and so it's all about certain items where we might move or not move.\nChuck Grom : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot Bob.\nBob Nelson: Thanks Chuck.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.\nMegan Alexander: Hi. Thanks very much. This is Megan Alexander on for Chris. Maybe a follow-up to Simeon's question. Are you seeing any pressure from rising fuel and diesel with regards to transportation in that core-on-core? And if so, it seems like they accelerated pretty quickly at the end of April. Are you holding back any of the price increases on those costs, such that it's impacting core-on-core maybe more than normal?\nBob Nelson: No, I don't believe so, Megan. I mean, I think overall, there's higher transportation costs across the whole supply chain, whether it's ocean freight or trucking or the price of fuel, et cetera, et cetera. I think eventually, those costs make their way into your sale price. Again, it's not like anything else. We tend to drag a little bit compared to others, but I don't think there's a material change since the end of April in terms of how we're managing that.\nMegan Alexander: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on LIFO. Since price increases have continued, it seems. Does that pressure continue to accelerate going forward? And then do we ever get that back as we lap, or does it depend on what the cost environment looks like?\nBob Nelson: Yeah. We I certainly can't be predictive and tell you exactly where it's going. We've, obviously, seen more inflation as years progressed. If we stay at this level, there will continue to be some impacts to our P&L. If we start to see deflation, if we were in an inflationary environment next year, yeah, we would get some of that back. But we've got a ways to go. I think everybody thinks we're still in a cycle of more inflation versus it stopping. Now to be fair, this is the first time when we get into Q4 that we'll actually start cycling some at the beginning of this last year. And I think we had a small LIFO charge in Q4 a year ago. So I'm not predicting, but we saw a little bit of decline in our fresh food inflation in this past quarter. Will we see some in other areas as we enter Q4? Maybe, but that could be offset by higher costs in other areas in the supply chain. So -- and then, of course, that higher level of inflation started hitting us in Q1 and Q2 of the beginning of this year. So I really can't predict where it's going to go. But assuming we get more inflation, we'll have more LIFO charges. To the extent that reverses at some point, we'll get some credits.\nMegan Alexander: Got it. Thank you very much.\nBob Nelson: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities.\nScot Ciccarelli: Hey, Bob, how are you?\nBob Nelson: Hi. Good.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good. I guess, more of a business strategy question, if you will. You guys had some pretty good SG&A leverage, which helped offset the merch margin compression that you saw, I guess the question is, would you tried to pass on more price increases to protect your gross margin if you didn't think you'd have as much SG&A leverage as you were able to generate?\nBob Nelson: That's a hard one to answer. Look, it's all -- look, we would never raise prices if we could get SG&A leverage in every single quarter from now until eternity. I mean, our goal would be to lower prices indefinitely and lower SG&A. It's all a balancing act. Sure. The same can be said on gross margins. I mean, everybody's read what's going on out there in the industry. Our sales in gas were very strong. Our gross margins were strong. And to the extent we're able to lever that into other areas of the business by holding prices? That's what we do. That's retail.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.\nJohn Heinbockel: Hey, Bob, I want to start with -- because we're uncharted territory here with inflation in recent times. To what degree do you guys -- and I don't think you do much of this, but test we're going to take pricing up in certain places, see what the consumer reaction is and then go more broadly. And have you seen any item by item, any elasticity, where you'd say, okay, we're not going to roll it out or not roll out the price increase or roll it back?\nBob Nelson: Yes. John, honestly, we don't really test markets or we won't take a market like Seattle and test taking a price up beyond our comfort level. It all comes down to value proposition and if we feel like we can take a price up and pass on some of the costs that we're incurring in our goods and the value proposition is still there, we'll go there. We're not testing all these items across the space.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay.\nBob Nelson: I mean it is unprecedented times. I will tell you that because of our limited SKU counts and the small number of SKUs that each buyer actually manages, they have a pretty good understanding of where their competitive situation is in the marketplace, and they have a pretty good feel about what kind of business they can do at what price. And I think that helps us in terms of managing that.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay. And then maybe secondly, gas gallons, right? So what has that been up? And I guess, historically, right, higher gas prices have translated into share gains for you. Are you starting to see that accelerate and drive some incremental traffic to clubs?\nBob Nelson: Well, that's a good question. Obviously, our value proposition in the marketplace is best-in-class, and it's actually accelerated versus where it was a year ago. I think the industry demand in gallons for gas is in the 1% to 2% range. And what I can tell you is we are much better than that in the high teens, the low 20s in terms of where we've been trending. I will say, we're certainly getting a lot of shops in the building when people buy gas. But given the extraordinarily high level, we're also getting a lot more members come by and top off their tank just because the value proposition in some cases is over $1 a gallon. And those members will come by and buy five or six gallons and then be on their way. So it's difficult to measure because of the -- just a huge amount of volume we're getting through our stations right now.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays.\nKaren Short: Hi. Thanks very much. So two questions. Bob, obviously, you addressed the membership component that everyone has on their mind. But I guess what I'm curious to hear from you is I think you've wavered in one another direction like based on the last four months. And so I'm curious to hear why you are kind of steadfast now that you would not raise membership fee, not that I necessarily think you should, but obviously, you've taken the stance. So that's my first question.\nBob Nelson: Well, I don't think we've really wavered. I think once we get a year out or year and a half out from that five and a half year cycle, we, frankly, just start to get a lot of questions about it. And the commentary in the prepared remarks is really more about just saying at this time, we don't think it's right for us. We're not saying that, we're not going to do it. We're just saying it's not right for us right now. And I think that's the same answer we had three months ago when we talked about it on the second quarter call. So I don't think anything's really changed other than we're just not at the five and a half year cycle yet. Does that make sense?\nKaren Short: Yeah, that makes sense. And then you made two comments just in terms of \u2013 I think you said that you were a little heavy in small clients holiday inventory, but you feel good about your ability to clear the inventory. So I just wanted to clarify what exactly you mean on that in terms of preparing potentially for a slowdown with the consumer and/or if you're thinking or maybe if you're not thinking there is? And where are you at on that broadly?\nBob Nelson: Well, I can't tell you whether I think there's going to be more pull back in a month or two months or three months. I mean, again, we feel really good about our ability to drive traffic and drive our members in and frankly, the ability to drive the top line. What I spoke to Ron yesterday about this, look, he thinks that we got a couple of extra weeks of supply in a couple of areas, and he thinks we can move through the inventory without really a lot of harbor or problem. On the seasonal stuff, a lot of that is just Christmas stuff that came in late \u2013 we've got it in deep freeze, and we're going to put it out this fall. And we're probably going to put it out at pretty good values because the price of all that stuff is going up. So we feel pretty good about being able to move that. And then the other comment I made is just more inventory that we think makes sense to have like masks and things like that, but where if there's some kind of hiccup in \u2013 in COD, we\u2019re well prepared. So I don\u2019t want to say strategic, but its \u2013 its a little bit more inventory than we might typically carry in a kind of non-environment like we're in now.\nKaren Short: Okay. Sorry to sneak one last one in. In terms of the fuel, obviously, that's a huge draw for you to your stores. Is there any update on the conversion into the store during your open hours in terms of people filling up the tanks and then actually going into the store conversion because I think that's historically been 70-ish percent during open hours?\nBob Nelson: No, no, no. That number has been like 50%. I'm not sure where 70% came from. That number has come down slightly. And again, because of what I mentioned earlier, we have a lot more members coming by and topping off their tank. But the overall number of shops from people buying gas is probably up. It's just the percentage is down because we have way more people going through the stations. So the penetration is down a little bit, but the number of relative shops is up probably.\nKaren Short: Okay. I thought it was 70% during open hours and 50 overall, but maybe I was wrong. So, thank you.\nBob Nelson: Yeah.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.\nEdward Kelly: Hi guys, good afternoon. I was hoping that maybe you could share some thoughts on the outlook for the gross margin in fiscal Q4. As we think about some of the pieces, year-over-year, the core compare kind of is easier, but it's not really on a two-year basis. It seems like you're probably still going to have LIFO. I don't think fuel margins are off to a very good start at all, but I -- maybe that's just because gas prices are rising and obviously, it's a long quarter. I'm just curious as to like the expectation that we should have around the current quarter?\nBob Nelson: Yeah, Ed, I wish I could be more transparent about -- we don't know what our budgets are on everything, but we really don't guide in terms of where gross margins are going to be. I think it continues to be a challenging environment. I think we feel good about our ability to pass through certain costs. In other areas, we don't feel as good about it, and we want to hold prices. So I think it's -- I can't tell you where exactly it's going to be. I think it's -- if I had to kind of -- it will be -- it looked much like what you're looking at this quarter. Maybe a little less, maybe a little more. But other than that, we really just don't -- we don't guide.\nEdward Kelly: Yeah. Okay. That's helpful. All right. Well, the other thing that I wanted to ask about, and you touched on it is just how you're navigating product cost inflation and pass through the customers? And I know historically, you would lag competition. I think maybe those like that -- the length of that lag has maybe been reduced to some extent. I don't know if that's true, just color there. And then what have you been able to do from a vendor standpoint because you don't sell a lot of SKUs, right? So you do have some real scale advantage within those products. So I'm just curious as to how those negotiations are going as well?\nBob Nelson: Well, look, like we've always said, our first goal is to mitigate any price increase. And our first goal is to partner with our vendor and figure out if there's a way to mitigate it for both of us. And that's the strategy. It's certainly more difficult times because there's more pressures coming from different areas. It's not just raw material cost, it's labor. It's -- there's more factors involved in it. But look, as you alluded to, we have -- we do a lot of volume in a relatively small number of the SKUs were very important to our suppliers in terms of the volume we do in some of these. And so they work with us. And I think at the end of the day, again, it's about showing the best value proposition in every item that we have on the shelf. And to the extent we're able to pass on some of those costs, and we still show a great value in that item, and that's great. In some instances, maybe we're not able to do that as effectively. But overall, I feel pretty good about our merchants being able to navigate through this. It's -- we've had a lot to navigate through the last couple of quarters. And I think I feel good about our ability to continue to do it as we look out into Q4 and then into the next fiscal year.\nEdward Kelly: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird.\nPeter Benedict: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Bob, nice job. A question on private label. Kirkland penetration, just maybe where that sits relative to maybe a year ago? And are you seeing any particular areas where you're getting stronger traction or growth rates are picking up there? Just curious how the consumer is behaving around private label.\nBob Nelson: Yes. I -- we actually took a look at that, and we were up a little bit in terms of penetration, probably 30 or 40 basis points. So we're still doing a lot of business there. But again, we're not -- as I mentioned earlier, when I was talking about the consumer, we're not seeing, I don't think a lot of trade down or trade out into -- from branded into our private label. So we continue to grow it, but I think in a way that makes sense for our business. And it's -- our consumers really aren't changing how they are shopping with us. I think we're up 0.4, I think, somewhere around 26 and change number in terms of penetration on a global basis?\nPeter Benedict: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then -- just -- I think you mentioned the higher year one renewal rate. I'm just curious maybe how long you've been seeing that? Is that a US dynamic? Is it an international dynamic? Is it happening everywhere, or maybe frame the numbers a little bit just to how much better it's been.\nBob Nelson: Yes, sure. We have historically been, depending on the country in the area, somewhere in the kind of low 50s to low -- sorry, high 50s to maybe 60, low 60s. And those numbers now are depending on the country in the high 60s to low 70s. So we've gradually seen over the last two years since the pandemic started about a 10% bump in our first year renewal -- our first year members, if you will, which we view as very favorable because we obviously signed up a lot of new members that hadn't tried us. Before the pandemic, they tried us, had a good experience, and we're seeing better retention rates out of those members.\nPeter Benedict: Yes. Well, certainly better than it going to the opposite direction. So good job. Thanks very much.\nBob Nelson: Thanks. Thanks, Peter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi.\nBrandon Cheatham: Hey. This is Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. I just wanted to ask about supply chain bottlenecks. Any particular categories that have improved any that have gotten worse. I think some of your competitors have mentioned general merge and furniture as some categories that have been challenging. Just wondering, if you all are seeing that as well.\nBob Nelson: Yes. I'm just -- I'm sitting here with Ron and he's indicating to me that we're pretty much across the board, improving everywhere slightly from where we were. It's not really in any one particular category. It's -- I think part of that is there's 40 or 50 ships in LA now instead of 100 or 120, and the fact that we've been able to utilize our own ships to kind of help get product over here. I think it's just improved a little bit across the board in all -- in everything that we're purchasing.\nBrandon Cheatham: Thanks. And I think in the past, you've mentioned that if you did have shortages, you would be able to kind of switch out a vendor or utilize an existing member -- vendor for new product. Has that kind of slowed because the supply chain has improved?\nBob Nelson: Well, look, we certainly are able to pivot more easily because we have less category business and more item business. So to the extent we're having difficulty in a particular item or have a hard time showing value in a particular item. We are able to pivot over into something else and put it in the warehouse. I don't -- I think that's just part of our DNA. What we do here every day, whether it's in the environment where we're operating in now or in a normal environment. So I think it's just a competitive advantage based on our \u2013 the structure of our business.\nBrandon Cheatham: Yeah. Appreciate it. Thanks. And good luck.\nBob Nelson: Yeah. Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.\nErica Eiler: Good afternoon. This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Thanks for taking our question. So I guess, first, you touched on gas prices and driving traffic to clubs, I was just curious, given the gas price dynamic out there right now, do you think that's driving more memberships at all to clubs as perhaps consumers seek out more value in this environment?\nBob Nelson: Sure. Sure, yeah. Sure. I think every member that signs up has a different reason, but sure, absolutely, particularly given the extreme value proposition in that \u2013 in gas right now.\nErica Eiler: Okay. And then just shifting gears kind of back to discretionary. You touched on seeing consumers spend in other categories, which is what we're hearing from everyone out there right now. I'm just curious, based on what you're seeing to date, has anything surprised you in terms of the shift by category that you're seeing right now that perhaps you hadn't planned for?\nBob Nelson: Not really. I mean, some of the areas I mentioned like sporting goods, well, all the gyms are opening up again and a lot of \u2013 within sporting goods, it's really exercise equipment that \u2013 we sold a lot a year ago. And this year, people are back at the gyms. Office is down a little bit. And again, people were setting up working from home a year ago. So it's no surprise to us that, that department is a little bit softer than a year ago. So not really, I think the categories that we're seeing be a little bit softer than we expect or categories that we expected to be soft. It's not a big surprise.\nErica Eiler: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nBob Nelson: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. \nKelly Bania: Well, thanks and well done, Bob. Just another question, as you think about that 7% inflation that you mentioned, can you maybe give us a little color on how that looks on the food and consumables side versus the discretionary side of the business. And as well, is there any difference in your ability or willingness to pass on some of the inflation on either side of the aisle there?\nBob Nelson: I would say in terms of our \u2013 we're certainly seeing higher inflation in certain non-food areas, although mix is bringing that down. You're going to sell fewer say, I'm making this up, but patio sets that are up, say, 10%, then you are, say, a piece of apparel that might be up less so. It's going to be less of an impact on a smaller priced item. I think overall, the inflation that we're seeing is relatively the same. Again, we're an item business. So we're certainly seeing it higher than that in some items and lower than that in other areas of the business. And I think, again, I need to keep using this term, but it's all about the value proposition. And our willingness to take pricing along or take pricing up depends on what our position is in the marketplace. And to the extent, we continue to show great value, it's a little easier to do that.\nKelly Bania: Okay. And maybe just to follow-up in terms of just big ticket in general. Can you just maybe talk about how that's trending? And do you think about maybe planning big ticket just a little bit more conservatively, or just help us understand the internal thought process about just big ticket in the current environment?\nBob Nelson: Yeah. Well, again, not to keep using this term, but we're an item business, and I think we're seeing great strength in furniture right now. We're seeing great strength in patio. We didn't have a good inventory supplies a year ago. We have more inventory now, and so we're able to move that product. Things like exercise equipment isn't as selling as much because -- or barbecues, for example. Everybody bought a barbecue last year, because everybody was home and cooking from home. Those certain items like that are not selling as well this year. I think the good thing for us is we're so broad-based in terms of the merchandise that we sell that we don't really -- I guess, we don't really look at it as big ticket. Appliances is another example. Appliances are very strong this year. Now again, we had a little bit of a supply constraint last year, more issues with chips that's getting better. It's not solved. But we're in better stock this year, and we're certainly selling more appliances than we did a year ago. And those are the biggest of ticket item. So what? What about it? Oh, my guys are saying travel. Not really a big ticket, but an experience. And with everybody pent up for two years and not traveling, yeah, that business has taken off like mad. So there's a lot of discussion and talk about a recession coming, but if you look in our buildings and you look at -- if you've been on an airplane lately, you'd never notice it.\nKelly Bania: Perfect. Thank you.\nBob Nelson: Yeah.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital.\nLaura Champine: Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk specifically about what you're seeing in renewal rates in China? I know that at first, you had such great member growth there. But I'm interested in how well you've retained those customers, just given what they've been through over the past few years?\nBob Nelson: Yeah. Laura, I don't have those in front of me, actually. If you want to ping me offline, we can maybe give you a little bit more color. I do know that they're slightly lower than we've seen in some markets because we signed up so many members in those first two warehouses. And so I know the retention rates are a little bit lower as a percentage, but part of that is when we opened our first building there, it was the only building, and now that we have two buildings with a third coming on the Shanghai market. It's going to change the dynamics a little bit.\nLaura Champine: Got it. And then just a detail on that one-time charge. Did you add a vacation day just basically because June 18th [ph] was made a holiday, or is there something else going on there?\nBob Nelson: No, it was just for each and every employee to use as they fit. It's essentially an additional floating holiday that each employee can use for a specific date that's important to them.\nLaura Champine: Got it. Thanks.\nBob Nelson: Why don't we take one or two more and then David, Josh and myself will be available for some off-line questions.\nOperator: Okay. And your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.\nGreg Melich: Hi, thanks. Bob, can you give us a little more insight into the ancillary business margin going up? Is that travel coming back? What's clearly driving that?\nBob Nelson: Well, certainly, gas was the biggest driver in there. And I think we mentioned that travel was also one of the beneficiaries.\nGreg Melich: And was -- and so penny profit and gas, we should accept that, that was actually up year-over-year.\nBob Nelson: Yes. It was up year-over-year. But keep in mind, the price of gas was up 40% year-over-year so.\nGreg Melich: The margin, yes.\nBob Nelson: Yes, yes.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And then a housekeeping on the day vacation, the charge, the $77 million -- is that an accrual for the year, or is that now in the base and we should see that each of the next four quarters?\nBob Nelson: It's both. It's the $77 million was essentially to get on the book, the cost of that vacation for each employee at that time on March 14, if you will. And then the ongoing cost of that is in our regular SG&A and benefit cost each quarter, correct.\nGreg Melich: Got it. So that\u2026\nBob Nelson: Those costs for Q3 -- or I should say, the eight weeks in Q3, we're just in the regular SG&A numbers.\nGreg Melich: Got it. So now -- so presumably that was eight weeks of Q3, and we can just look at the weekly and sort of use that running forward?\nBob Nelson: Well, we didn't give you what it was by week. That's what it was for the year.\nGreg Melich: Oh, that's what it was for the -- so the $77 million was for the year?\nBob Nelson: Correct. There were additional cost quarter relating to the eight weeks for that benefit\u2026\nGreg Melich: Got it. Okay.\nBob Nelson: I mean, I guess...\nGreg Melich: All right. That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot.\nBob Nelson: Yes, thanks, Greg.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephanie Wissink with Jefferies.\nBlake Anderson: It's Blake on for Steph. Thanks for squeezing us in. I wanted to see if you could give any color on new member growth. I know you talked about gas was a benefit to attracting members and you didn't see a lot of trade down for existing members, but I didn't know if you could talk about maybe any new members joining the club for savings on food or non-food specifically.\nBob Nelson: Well, we don't really ask each member when they sign up, why they're signing up. I'm hoping that there's a different value proposition for each and every member that entices them to be a member and sign up. The one thing I can add on to that is we are getting more strength in terms of the number of members that sign up digitally and that's really grown throughout the pandemic and become a bigger percentage of our growth as well. And I think some of that has to do with some of our online offerings that hit -- particularly in say, grocery. If you don't live within 10 or 15 miles of a club. But in the pandemic, you tried this, you moved a little bit further away, you had a good experience. You signed up digitally and you stay digitally and you might use this half digitally and half in the warehouse. So I think it's a different reason for everybody, really. It just depends on your preferences.\nBlake Anderson: Okay. And then lastly, on renewal rate, that was strong in the quarter. Just wondering how that was versus your expectations and also the MFI growth versus your expectations as well? Thank you.\nBob Nelson: Okay. My guys are telling me -- I didn't know, but I think it was pretty much in line with what our expectations were. I mean we continue -- when you kind of take a look at what's driving that, we continue to convert more base members to the executive member program who tend to renew at a higher rate and have more loyalty with us. That's contributing to that. We see that every week. So we know that's going to help the renewal rates. And so I think based on \u2013 and of course, the first year renewal rates that are improving, we know that's going to help the number as well and signing up more members. So all that, I think, is contributing to those improved metrics, if you will.\nBlake Anderson: Thanks, Bob. That's helpful.\nBob Nelson: In auto bill, yeah.\nBob Nelson: Okay. If there's no more questions, we'll call it a wrap. I appreciate everybody dialing in today. And again, David and Josh and myself are available, if you guys have any follow-ups. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bob Nelson",
            "content": "Thank you, Erica, and good afternoon to everyone. This is Bob Nelson, Senior VP of Finance and Investor Relations here at Costco. Thank you for dialing in into today's conference call to review our third quarter fiscal year 2022 operating results. Before we begin, a couple of housekeeping items to take care of. First, as you now have surmised, Richard is not with us today. He is doing great and wishes he could be on the call. He is in Italy with his family on a rescheduled vacation that was canceled early in the pandemic. He wanted me to pass along his best to everyone and in his absence I will be filling in for him today. Secondly, and before we get into the details of today's earnings results, I need to read our safe harbor disclosure. Let's begin. These discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and our performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. Okay. With that out of the way, let's get to it. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the 12 weeks ended this past May 8th. Net income for the quarter was $1.353 billion, $3.04 per diluted share. The reported $3.04 included a one-time $77 million pre-tax charge, $0.13 per diluted share for incremental benefits awarded under the new employee agreement effective this past March 14th. Last year's third quarter net income was $1.22 billion, $2.75 per diluted share, which included $57 million pre-tax or $0.09 per diluted share for costs incurred primarily from COVID-19 premium wages. In terms of this year's $77 million pre-tax charge, this was in conjunction with our new employee agreement, again, effective this past March 14th and was primarily to adjust our benefit accrual to account for one additional day of vacation, which is awarded to each employee immediately. The continuing impacts of the wage and benefit enhancements are reflected in SG&A and margin for this quarter and will be in for -- as well as for subsequent quarters. Net income for the first 36 weeks of fiscal 2022 was $3.98 billion, $8.94 per diluted share, and that compares to $3.34 billion or $7.51 per diluted share last year. Now -- let's now review the metrics of our P&L. As always, starting with sales, net sales for the third quarter increased 16.3% to $51.61 billion and that compares to $44.38 billion reported last year in Q3. In terms of comparable sales for the third quarter, for the 12 weeks on a reported basis, the US was better or up by 16.6%, Canada better by 15.2%. Other international, up 5.7% and total company, again, up 14.9%. Our e-comm business in the third quarter reported better by 7.4% versus a year ago. For the 12 weeks, excluding the benefit of gas inflation and the headwinds of FX the US came in at up 10.7%, Canada better by 12.8%, other international up $9.1 million, and on a total company basis, ex gas inflation and FX headwinds better by 10.8%, and e-commerce just below 8% at 7.9% for the quarter. In terms of Q3 comp metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 6.8% worldwide and up 5.6% in the US. Our average transaction was up 7.6% worldwide and up 10.4% in the US during the quarter. And foreign currencies relative to the US dollar negatively impacted sales by just a little over 1% and our gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales in the quarter, just a little bit more than 5%. The best performing categories in Q3 were candy, sundries, tires, toys, jewelry, kiosks, home furnishings, apparel, bakery and deli. Underperforming departments were liquor, office, sporting goods and hardware, all of which were quite strong a year ago. In terms of other business sales, the best performers came in from gasoline, travel, food courts and our business centers. So overall, our sales grew nicely in the quarter. And for the most part, were pretty broad-based. Moving down the income statement to membership fee income reported in Q3, $984 million or 1.91 as a percentage of sales, compared to last year's $901 million or 2.03 as a percentage of sales. That's up $83 million year-over-year or a 9.2% increase. And excluding headwinds from FX of about $10.6 million, membership was up, 10.4% in the quarter. In terms of renewal rates, we hit an all-time -- we hit all-time highs. At Q3 end, our US and Canada renewal rate was 92.3%, up 0.3% from the 12 weeks earlier at Q2 end. And the worldwide rate came in at 90% for the first time in company history, and that's up 0.4% from what we reported at Q2 end. Renewal rates continue to benefit from the increased penetration of both auto renewals and more executive members. And in addition to that, higher first year member renewal rates than what we have historically seen. In terms of member counts, number of member households and cardholders at Q3 end, we ended Q3 with 64.4 million paid households and 116.6 million cardholders, both of those up over 6%, compared to a year ago. At Q3 end, our paid executive memberships were 27.9 million, and that's an increase of just about 800,000 during the 12 weeks since Q2 end. Executive members now represent over 43% of our member base and over 71% of our worldwide sales. Now before I move on, I want to take just a minute and address the question that we've been getting a lot recently regarding the timing of the potential membership fee increase. Historically, we've raised fees every five to six years with the last three increases coming on average at about the 5.5-year time frame, and our last increase coming in June of 2017. As we approach this 5.5-year mark, there will be more discussions with Craig, Ron and the executive team. But for today, we have nothing more specific to report in terms of timing. In addition, given the current macro environment, the historically high inflation and the burden it is having on our members and all consumers in general, we think increasing our membership fee today ahead of our typical timing is not the right time. We will let you know, however, when that changes. Okay. Moving on, along the P&L, let's take a look at gross margins. Our reported gross margins in the third quarter were lower year-over-year by 99 basis points. This year coming in at 10.19% as a percentage of sales, and that compares to last year's 11.18% that we reported a year ago, so the 99 basis points down year-over-year. And excluding the negative impact of gas inflation, we would have been down 53 basis points. So if you would for me and as normal, please jot down the following for our gross margin metrics. And again, as usual, two columns, the first column being reported gross margin, the second column being gross margin and without the impact of gas inflation. There are six rows, the first row being merchandised core; second, ancillary and other business; the third row, 2% rewards; followed by LIFO; other; and then total. So in terms of our core merchandise margins on a reported basis, they were down 87 basis points versus last year, down 46 basis points ex-gas, ancillary and other plus six reported and plus 18 ex-gas, 2% rewards plus eight and plus three; LIFO, minus 25 basis points on a reported basis and minus 27% ex gas inflation; and finally, other minus one with and without gas. So again, in total, down 99 reported, down 53 excluding the impact of gas inflation. A little color, more color on gross margins, starting with core merchandise. The core merchandise contribution to gross margin was lower by 46 basis points, ex gas inflation in the quarter. Sales mix negatively impacted the core, primarily from the lower sales penetration of total core sales relative to our gasoline sales, which were very strong in the quarter. In terms of the core margins on their own sales in Q3, our core-on-core margins were lower by 39 basis points. Approximately two-thirds of this coming from fresh foods. Fresh experienced a very difficult compare versus last year when the extraordinary volumes produced lower D&D and higher labor productivity a year ago. Also contributing to the fresh decline this quarter were higher raw material costs and higher labor costs due to our new wages. Ancillary and other business gross margin, again, higher by six reported higher by 18 basis points ex gas inflation. Gas, travel and business centers were better year-over-year, offset somewhat by e-com, pharmacy and optical. Again, 2% rewards higher by eight reported higher by three ex gas. LIFO, minus 25 and minus 27 ex gas as we recorded $130 million charge in the quarter for LIFO and other was minus 1 basis point, both with and ex gas inflation. This included items from both years. Last year, we had $14 million of COVID expenses, primarily premium wages within gross margin. This year, we had a onetime charge discussed at the beginning of the call, $20 million of the $77 million, of which related to gross margin. The net result of these two items, again, minus 1 basis point. And while we continue to mitigate the impact of price increases as best as we can, we remain comfortable in our ability to pass through higher costs while providing great value to our members. Moving to SG&A. We showed good results. Our reported SG&A in the third quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 84 basis points, coming in at 8.62% and that compares to last year's reported 9.46% SG&A figure. That's, again, 84 basis points lower or better and 44 basis points, excluding the impact of gas inflation. Again, if you jot down the following for our SG&A matrix, again, two columns, the first column being reported SG&A; the second column, SG&A ex the impact of gas inflation. And we have five rows, the first row operations, second row central, third row stock compensation expense, third -- or fourth through other and then total is the fifth row. In terms of our operations on a reported basis, SG&A was better by 68 basis points and ex the benefit of gas inflation better by 35. Central better by 15 reported, better by 10 ex gas. Stock compensation better by two reported, better by one ex-gas and other minus one and minus twp ex gas. Again, all totaled 84 basis points lower or better and 44 excluding the benefit of gas inflation. In Q3 year-over-year, the core operations component of SG&A was better by 68%, again, 35 ex gas. Keep in mind, this result includes the starting wage increase we instituted this past October, as well as eight weeks of the new wage and benefit increases just implemented during Q3 on October 14 of this year. Central was better by 15 and better by 10 without gas. Stock comp plus two, plus one without gas and again, other minus one basis point, minus two without gas inflation. Similar to gross margin, this included items from both years. Last year, we had $44 million of COVID expenses. And this year, we had a one-time charge again discussed at the beginning of the call, $57 million of the $77 million, which related to SG&A. The net result of these two items, again, minus one reported, minus two ex gas inflation. So all told, reported operating income in Q3 of this year increased 8%, coming in at $1.791 billion. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $35 million this year versus $40 million last year. And interest income and other for the quarter was higher by 44 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to favorable FX. Overall, pre-tax profit \u2013 pre-tax income came in for the quarter at up 11%, coming in at $1.827 billion, and that compares to $1.65 billion, which we reported a year ago. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q3 was 24.9% that compares to 25.2% in Q3 last year. Overall, for the year, our effective tax rate is currently projected to be between 26% and 27%. A few other items of note, warehouse expansion. In Q3, we opened one net new warehouse plus two relocations. Q3 year-to-date, we have opened 17 warehouses, including three relocations, for a net of 14 new warehouses so far this fiscal year. For the remainder of the fiscal year and in Q4, we expect to open an additional 10 new warehouses, which will put us at 27 for the year, including three relocations and for a net of 24 net new warehouses for all of fiscal year 2022. The 24 new warehouses by market are 14 in the US, two in Canada and one each in Korea, Japan, Australia, Mexico, Spain, France, China and our first opening in New Zealand, which will occur in August of this year. In terms of the new openings this year, this is four fewer than what we projected in Q2. Two of the four were impacted by supply chain issues related to electrical equipment. And the other two have been delayed due to third-party site development issues. All four of these buildings are now scheduled to open by the end of calendar November this fall. Incidentally, there are three in the US and one in Australia that were delayed. The one net new opening in Q3 was a business center located in San Marcos, California. And the first of the 10 scheduled to open in Q4 opened this past week in Riverton, Utah, bringing our worldwide total to 830 Costco's as of today and around the world. Regarding CapEx, the Q3, 2022 spend was approximately $854 million. Our full year CapEx spend is estimated for the year to be just shy of about $4 billion. In terms of our e-comm business, comm sales in Q3, ex-FX increased 7.9%. This is on top of the 38% increase a year ago. Stronger departments in the quarter were special order, patio and garden, jewelry and home furnishings. Our largest e-comm merchandise department managers, which includes consumer electronics, appliances, TVs, was up a little bit better than mid-single digits on a very strong sales increase a year earlier. And Costco grocery, including our third-party delivery, two-day dry, fresh and frozen continues to grow, up low double digits in the quarter. An update on Costco Logistics. Costco Logistics continues to drive big and bulky sales for us. We averaged more than 58,000 stops a week in the third quarter. For the full year, we estimate total deliveries will be up 23% and will exceed $3 million. With Logistics, we continue to transition from vendor drop ship to direct ship from our own inventory, particularly in big and bulky items. Overall, this lowers the cost of merchandise and improved delivery times and service levels for our members. Okay. A few -- now a few comments regarding inflation. First of all, it continues. Pressures from higher commodity prices, higher wages, higher transportation costs and supply chain disruptions all still in play. For Q1, we estimate price inflation was in the 4.5% to 5% range. For Q2, we had estimated 6%-ish, if you will. And for Q3 and talking to our merchants, estimated price inflation was in the 7%-ish range. However, we did see inflation in fresh foods come in slightly lower in Q3 versus Q2 a year ago as we began cycling high meat prices. We believe our solid sales increases and relatively consistent margins show that we have continued to strike the right balance in passing on higher costs. Switching over to inventory for a minute. Our total inventory in Q3 was up 26% year-over-year versus up 19% in Q2, a couple of high-level comments regarding inventory. A material component of the increase year-over-year is inflation rather than unit growth. We continue to expand open new locations, 20 new in the last 12 months. We are lapping some low stocks in certain departments as a result of last year's high demand. And we are purposely building inventory in our e-comm business, primarily in big and bulky categories as mentioned earlier in the call. Food and sundries and fresh is in very good shape. Our weak supply is comparable year-over-year. Nonfood inventories are up in certain categories. This is in part a result of being light in certain departments last year, specifically, seasonal lawn and garden, TVs, appliances and sporting goods. Otherwise, we are a little heavy in small appliances and domestics, primarily due to late arriving merchandise this year. In addition, we have a few hundred million dollars of extra inventory in both late arriving holiday merchandise from last season, which we're storing until this fall and some buy in merchandise to ensure proper inventory levels in the face of these ongoing supply chain issues. Speaking with Craig, Ron and Claudine Adamo, our new Head of Merchandising, we feel good about our current inventory levels. The additional inventory we're carrying is in the right departments, and they feel good about our ability to move it. A quick update on China. Our first opening in China located in Minhang, Shanghai was closed for the last six weeks of the third quarter. That closure had a negative impact in the quarter of approximately $35 million in sales. As of May 18, we're happy to report that building is back open, but operating under restrictions on the number of people that can be in the building at one time, among other cleaning and operating restrictions. Our second building in Suzhou, which opened in December of this last December, was largely -- has largely avoided the lockdowns and restrictions to this point. We're currently targeting an opening date of this December for our third Shanghai building in Pudong. The timing, although will somewhat depend on the area remaining open for the next several months and not being more negatively impacted by lockdowns Four additional China buildings are currently underway and planned. It was opening dates in the next two years. These would be our first China openings outside of Shanghai. I believe we have -- of those four, one is in fiscal 2023 and three in fiscal 2024. As a reminder, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results for the four weeks ending Sunday, May 29, this next week on Thursday, June 2, after market close. This is a day later than our traditional Wednesday release due to the Memorial Day holiday. Before wrapping up, a quick shout out to the 300,000 worldwide Costco employees around the globe, and the excellent work and proactive effort they give each day to navigate during these most challenging environment. Our merchants and operators are the best in the business, and their hard work is reflected in our strong operating results. Finally, I want to address some incorrect information floating around on social media and a few other media outlets claiming that we have increased the price of our $1.50 hot dog and soda combinations sold in our food courts. Let me just say the price when we introduced the hot dog/ soda combo in the mid-80s was $1.50. The price today is $1.50, and we have no plans to increase the price at this time. With that, I will turn it back over to Erika and open it up for Q&A. Thank you. Good. I got help. Yes. On the fresh side, we literally had no D&D last year. And we had very high labor productivity because of the pounds that we were going \u2013 that we were processing, if you will. So I think we've kept a lot of that leverage actually. We're way above pre-pandemic levels. It's just that was extraordinary last year. So \u2013 and I think we'll keep some of that. But it's not all that. And then a little bit of it is, like I said, raw material costs this year. I mean, those eventually make their way into our \u2013 the price of our goods. But as you know, we're not the first one to go up when we have higher costs. I think just recently, it may have been after the end of the quarter, we reluctantly, but we took up the price of our muffins and our croissants, I think $1 as the price of a lot of those raw materials have continued to escalate to two and three and four times what they were last year. So that's essentially what's going on there. Yeah. Honestly, we're not seeing a lot of change in our throughput in the buildings. I mean, we're seeing a lot of traffic. We're not seeing a lot of \u2013 we're not seeing trade down really. We're seeing a little bit of shift in where people are spending their money. Last year, there was more stuff for the home and that \u2013 and this year, it's more sales in tickets and restaurants and travel and tires and gas and things of that nature. But we're still holding our own in areas like apparel and furniture and jewelry, TVs, appliances. All those departments are showing good decent sales growth on top of pretty good numbers a year ago. I would say overall, there might be a very small amount in terms of the number of items in the basket this year. A little less than last year because there was more trip consolidation going on a year ago, I think, during COVID. But overall, I think we feel pretty good about what we're seeing and how our members are shopping. Well, look, I think we always want to be the best value in the marketplace. And to the extent that we continue to show that, I think it's easier for us to pass on higher pricing, or higher freight costs, or raw material cost, assuming that we show that value in the marketplace. And that's what it's all about really. And I think we feel good about it. I mean, our most recent shops against who we watch most closely have not changed. And we're every bit as competitive as we've been, notwithstanding the fact we have taken some prices up in certain areas in food, in sundries and in fresh foods. Well, I think the balance was slightly more in nonfoods than in foods in terms of the remaining third of the lower margins. I'm not sure I have specifics right now on certain specific categories. I mean, again, it's not really a category, we're an item business, and so it's all about certain items where we might move or not move. Thanks Chuck. No, I don't believe so, Megan. I mean, I think overall, there's higher transportation costs across the whole supply chain, whether it's ocean freight or trucking or the price of fuel, et cetera, et cetera. I think eventually, those costs make their way into your sale price. Again, it's not like anything else. We tend to drag a little bit compared to others, but I don't think there's a material change since the end of April in terms of how we're managing that. Yeah. We I certainly can't be predictive and tell you exactly where it's going. We've, obviously, seen more inflation as years progressed. If we stay at this level, there will continue to be some impacts to our P&L. If we start to see deflation, if we were in an inflationary environment next year, yeah, we would get some of that back. But we've got a ways to go. I think everybody thinks we're still in a cycle of more inflation versus it stopping. Now to be fair, this is the first time when we get into Q4 that we'll actually start cycling some at the beginning of this last year. And I think we had a small LIFO charge in Q4 a year ago. So I'm not predicting, but we saw a little bit of decline in our fresh food inflation in this past quarter. Will we see some in other areas as we enter Q4? Maybe, but that could be offset by higher costs in other areas in the supply chain. So -- and then, of course, that higher level of inflation started hitting us in Q1 and Q2 of the beginning of this year. So I really can't predict where it's going to go. But assuming we get more inflation, we'll have more LIFO charges. To the extent that reverses at some point, we'll get some credits. Sure. Hi. Good. That's a hard one to answer. Look, it's all -- look, we would never raise prices if we could get SG&A leverage in every single quarter from now until eternity. I mean, our goal would be to lower prices indefinitely and lower SG&A. It's all a balancing act. Sure. The same can be said on gross margins. I mean, everybody's read what's going on out there in the industry. Our sales in gas were very strong. Our gross margins were strong. And to the extent we're able to lever that into other areas of the business by holding prices? That's what we do. That's retail. Yes. John, honestly, we don't really test markets or we won't take a market like Seattle and test taking a price up beyond our comfort level. It all comes down to value proposition and if we feel like we can take a price up and pass on some of the costs that we're incurring in our goods and the value proposition is still there, we'll go there. We're not testing all these items across the space. I mean it is unprecedented times. I will tell you that because of our limited SKU counts and the small number of SKUs that each buyer actually manages, they have a pretty good understanding of where their competitive situation is in the marketplace, and they have a pretty good feel about what kind of business they can do at what price. And I think that helps us in terms of managing that. Well, that's a good question. Obviously, our value proposition in the marketplace is best-in-class, and it's actually accelerated versus where it was a year ago. I think the industry demand in gallons for gas is in the 1% to 2% range. And what I can tell you is we are much better than that in the high teens, the low 20s in terms of where we've been trending. I will say, we're certainly getting a lot of shops in the building when people buy gas. But given the extraordinarily high level, we're also getting a lot more members come by and top off their tank just because the value proposition in some cases is over $1 a gallon. And those members will come by and buy five or six gallons and then be on their way. So it's difficult to measure because of the -- just a huge amount of volume we're getting through our stations right now. Well, I don't think we've really wavered. I think once we get a year out or year and a half out from that five and a half year cycle, we, frankly, just start to get a lot of questions about it. And the commentary in the prepared remarks is really more about just saying at this time, we don't think it's right for us. We're not saying that, we're not going to do it. We're just saying it's not right for us right now. And I think that's the same answer we had three months ago when we talked about it on the second quarter call. So I don't think anything's really changed other than we're just not at the five and a half year cycle yet. Does that make sense? Well, I can't tell you whether I think there's going to be more pull back in a month or two months or three months. I mean, again, we feel really good about our ability to drive traffic and drive our members in and frankly, the ability to drive the top line. What I spoke to Ron yesterday about this, look, he thinks that we got a couple of extra weeks of supply in a couple of areas, and he thinks we can move through the inventory without really a lot of harbor or problem. On the seasonal stuff, a lot of that is just Christmas stuff that came in late \u2013 we've got it in deep freeze, and we're going to put it out this fall. And we're probably going to put it out at pretty good values because the price of all that stuff is going up. So we feel pretty good about being able to move that. And then the other comment I made is just more inventory that we think makes sense to have like masks and things like that, but where if there's some kind of hiccup in \u2013 in COD, we're well prepared. So I don't want to say strategic, but its \u2013 its a little bit more inventory than we might typically carry in a kind of non-environment like we're in now. No, no, no. That number has been like 50%. I'm not sure where 70% came from. That number has come down slightly. And again, because of what I mentioned earlier, we have a lot more members coming by and topping off their tank. But the overall number of shops from people buying gas is probably up. It's just the percentage is down because we have way more people going through the stations. So the penetration is down a little bit, but the number of relative shops is up probably. Yeah. Yeah, Ed, I wish I could be more transparent about -- we don't know what our budgets are on everything, but we really don't guide in terms of where gross margins are going to be. I think it continues to be a challenging environment. I think we feel good about our ability to pass through certain costs. In other areas, we don't feel as good about it, and we want to hold prices. So I think it's -- I can't tell you where exactly it's going to be. I think it's -- if I had to kind of -- it will be -- it looked much like what you're looking at this quarter. Maybe a little less, maybe a little more. But other than that, we really just don't -- we don't guide. Well, look, like we've always said, our first goal is to mitigate any price increase. And our first goal is to partner with our vendor and figure out if there's a way to mitigate it for both of us. And that's the strategy. It's certainly more difficult times because there's more pressures coming from different areas. It's not just raw material cost, it's labor. It's -- there's more factors involved in it. But look, as you alluded to, we have -- we do a lot of volume in a relatively small number of the SKUs were very important to our suppliers in terms of the volume we do in some of these. And so they work with us. And I think at the end of the day, again, it's about showing the best value proposition in every item that we have on the shelf. And to the extent we're able to pass on some of those costs, and we still show a great value in that item, and that's great. In some instances, maybe we're not able to do that as effectively. But overall, I feel pretty good about our merchants being able to navigate through this. It's -- we've had a lot to navigate through the last couple of quarters. And I think I feel good about our ability to continue to do it as we look out into Q4 and then into the next fiscal year. Yes. I -- we actually took a look at that, and we were up a little bit in terms of penetration, probably 30 or 40 basis points. So we're still doing a lot of business there. But again, we're not -- as I mentioned earlier, when I was talking about the consumer, we're not seeing, I don't think a lot of trade down or trade out into -- from branded into our private label. So we continue to grow it, but I think in a way that makes sense for our business. And it's -- our consumers really aren't changing how they are shopping with us. I think we're up 0.4, I think, somewhere around 26 and change number in terms of penetration on a global basis? Yes, sure. We have historically been, depending on the country in the area, somewhere in the kind of low 50s to low -- sorry, high 50s to maybe 60, low 60s. And those numbers now are depending on the country in the high 60s to low 70s. So we've gradually seen over the last two years since the pandemic started about a 10% bump in our first year renewal -- our first year members, if you will, which we view as very favorable because we obviously signed up a lot of new members that hadn't tried us. Before the pandemic, they tried us, had a good experience, and we're seeing better retention rates out of those members. Thanks. Thanks, Peter. Yes. I'm just -- I'm sitting here with Ron and he's indicating to me that we're pretty much across the board, improving everywhere slightly from where we were. It's not really in any one particular category. It's -- I think part of that is there's 40 or 50 ships in LA now instead of 100 or 120, and the fact that we've been able to utilize our own ships to kind of help get product over here. I think it's just improved a little bit across the board in all -- in everything that we're purchasing. Well, look, we certainly are able to pivot more easily because we have less category business and more item business. So to the extent we're having difficulty in a particular item or have a hard time showing value in a particular item. We are able to pivot over into something else and put it in the warehouse. I don't -- I think that's just part of our DNA. What we do here every day, whether it's in the environment where we're operating in now or in a normal environment. So I think it's just a competitive advantage based on our \u2013 the structure of our business. Yeah. Great. Thanks. Sure. Sure, yeah. Sure. I think every member that signs up has a different reason, but sure, absolutely, particularly given the extreme value proposition in that \u2013 in gas right now. Not really. I mean, some of the areas I mentioned like sporting goods, well, all the gyms are opening up again and a lot of \u2013 within sporting goods, it's really exercise equipment that \u2013 we sold a lot a year ago. And this year, people are back at the gyms. Office is down a little bit. And again, people were setting up working from home a year ago. So it's no surprise to us that, that department is a little bit softer than a year ago. So not really, I think the categories that we're seeing be a little bit softer than we expect or categories that we expected to be soft. It's not a big surprise. Sure. I would say in terms of our \u2013 we're certainly seeing higher inflation in certain non-food areas, although mix is bringing that down. You're going to sell fewer say, I'm making this up, but patio sets that are up, say, 10%, then you are, say, a piece of apparel that might be up less so. It's going to be less of an impact on a smaller priced item. I think overall, the inflation that we're seeing is relatively the same. Again, we're an item business. So we're certainly seeing it higher than that in some items and lower than that in other areas of the business. And I think, again, I need to keep using this term, but it's all about the value proposition. And our willingness to take pricing along or take pricing up depends on what our position is in the marketplace. And to the extent, we continue to show great value, it's a little easier to do that. Yeah. Well, again, not to keep using this term, but we're an item business, and I think we're seeing great strength in furniture right now. We're seeing great strength in patio. We didn't have a good inventory supplies a year ago. We have more inventory now, and so we're able to move that product. Things like exercise equipment isn't as selling as much because -- or barbecues, for example. Everybody bought a barbecue last year, because everybody was home and cooking from home. Those certain items like that are not selling as well this year. I think the good thing for us is we're so broad-based in terms of the merchandise that we sell that we don't really -- I guess, we don't really look at it as big ticket. Appliances is another example. Appliances are very strong this year. Now again, we had a little bit of a supply constraint last year, more issues with chips that's getting better. It's not solved. But we're in better stock this year, and we're certainly selling more appliances than we did a year ago. And those are the biggest of ticket item. So what? What about it? Oh, my guys are saying travel. Not really a big ticket, but an experience. And with everybody pent up for two years and not traveling, yeah, that business has taken off like mad. So there's a lot of discussion and talk about a recession coming, but if you look in our buildings and you look at -- if you've been on an airplane lately, you'd never notice it. Yeah. Yeah. Laura, I don't have those in front of me, actually. If you want to ping me offline, we can maybe give you a little bit more color. I do know that they're slightly lower than we've seen in some markets because we signed up so many members in those first two warehouses. And so I know the retention rates are a little bit lower as a percentage, but part of that is when we opened our first building there, it was the only building, and now that we have two buildings with a third coming on the Shanghai market. It's going to change the dynamics a little bit. No, it was just for each and every employee to use as they fit. It's essentially an additional floating holiday that each employee can use for a specific date that's important to them. Why don't we take one or two more and then David, Josh and myself will be available for some off-line questions. Well, certainly, gas was the biggest driver in there. And I think we mentioned that travel was also one of the beneficiaries. Yes. It was up year-over-year. But keep in mind, the price of gas was up 40% year-over-year so. Yes, yes. It's both. It's the $77 million was essentially to get on the book, the cost of that vacation for each employee at that time on March 14, if you will. And then the ongoing cost of that is in our regular SG&A and benefit cost each quarter, correct. Those costs for Q3 -- or I should say, the eight weeks in Q3, we're just in the regular SG&A numbers. Well, we didn't give you what it was by week. That's what it was for the year. Correct. There were additional cost quarter relating to the eight weeks for that benefit... I mean, I guess... Yes, thanks, Greg. Well, we don't really ask each member when they sign up, why they're signing up. I'm hoping that there's a different value proposition for each and every member that entices them to be a member and sign up. The one thing I can add on to that is we are getting more strength in terms of the number of members that sign up digitally and that's really grown throughout the pandemic and become a bigger percentage of our growth as well. And I think some of that has to do with some of our online offerings that hit -- particularly in say, grocery. If you don't live within 10 or 15 miles of a club. But in the pandemic, you tried this, you moved a little bit further away, you had a good experience. You signed up digitally and you stay digitally and you might use this half digitally and half in the warehouse. So I think it's a different reason for everybody, really. It just depends on your preferences. Okay. My guys are telling me -- I didn't know, but I think it was pretty much in line with what our expectations were. I mean we continue -- when you kind of take a look at what's driving that, we continue to convert more base members to the executive member program who tend to renew at a higher rate and have more loyalty with us. That's contributing to that. We see that every week. So we know that's going to help the renewal rates. And so I think based on \u2013 and of course, the first year renewal rates that are improving, we know that's going to help the number as well and signing up more members. So all that, I think, is contributing to those improved metrics, if you will. In auto bill, yeah. Okay. If there's no more questions, we'll call it a wrap. I appreciate everybody dialing in today. And again, David and Josh and myself are available, if you guys have any follow-ups. Have a good day."

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you, Jerome, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law.  In today's press release, we reported operating results for the second quarter of fiscal '22, the 12 weeks ended this past February 13, as well as February retail results for the four weeks ended this past Sunday, February 27.  Net income for the quarter came in at $1,299 million or $2.92 per diluted share. Last year's second quarter net income came in at $951 million or $2.14 per diluted share. That latter number included a $246 million pretax or $0.41 per share costs, incurred primarily from COVID-19 premium wages.  Net income for the 24 weeks was $2.62 billion or $5.90 per share compared to $2.12 billion or $4.76 per diluted share last year in the first half. Net sales for the quarter increased 16.1% to $50.94 billion, up from $43.89 billion last year in the second quarter. Comparable sales in the second quarter for fiscal '22, on a reported basis, U.S. sales increase during the 12-week period was 15.8%, excluding gas inflation, 11.3%; Canada, 16% reported, 12.4% ex-gas inflation and FX; other International, 6.2%; and plus 9% ex-gas inflation and FX for the total company reported number of 14.4% on a same-store comparable basis and up 11.1%, excluding gas inflation effects. E-commerce, on a reported basis, up 12.5% and FX, up 12.6%.  In terms of our second quarter comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 9.3% worldwide and up 8.3% year-over-year in the quarter in the United States. Our average transaction or ticket was up 4.6% worldwide and up 6.9% in the U.S. during the second quarter. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 60 basis points, while gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 390 basis points. I will review our February sales results later in the call.  Going down our second quarter fiscal 2022 income statement. Membership fee income reported came in at $967 million, up $86 million or up 9.8% from a year earlier, $881 million. There was about a $6.5 million impact -- negative impact due to FX. So on an ex FX basis, if you will, the $86 million increase would have been up $92 million or 10.4%.  In terms of renewal rates, they continue to increase. At second quarter-end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate stood at 92.0%, up 0.4 percentage point from the 12-week earlier Q1 end. And worldwide rate, it came in at 89.6%, up 0.6% from where it stood 12 weeks earlier at Q1 end. Our renewal rates are continuing to benefit from more members' auto renewing as well as increased penetration of executive members who on average renew at a higher rate than nonexecutive members, and higher first year renewal rates for our new members. In terms of the number of members at second quarter-end, member households and total cardholders. Total households was $63.4 million, up 900,000 from the $62.5 million just 12 weeks earlier. And total cardholders at Q2 end, $114.8 million, up $1.7 million from the $113.1 million figure 12 weeks ago.  At second quarter-end, paid executive memberships stood at $27.1 million, an increase of $644,000 during the 12-week period since Q1 end. Executive members, by the way, represent now 42.7% of our total membership base and 70.9% of our total sales.  Moving down to the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin in the second quarter was lower year-over-year by 32 basis points, but up 5 basis points, excluding gas inflation. As I always do, I'll ask you to judge on a few numbers, two columns. The first column is reported, the second column would be excluding gas inflation.  First line item, merchandise - core merchandise on a reported basis was down 75% -- 75 basis points year-over-year and ex gas inflation, down 43 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses reported plus 40 basis points and ex gas inflation, plus 49 basis points, 2% reward, plus 3 and minus 1 basis points; LIFO, minus 14 and minus 14 basis points; other plus 14 and plus 14 basis points. So totally, on a reported basis, again, year-over-year, minus 32 basis points and excluding gas inflation, plus 5 basis points. Now in terms of the core merchandise component being lower by 75% year-over-year reported and 43 -- minus 43 basis points ex gas inflation. Recall last year in Q2 that the core reported was plus 71 basis points in ex gas plus 63, so still improved to where we were two years ago, prepandemic and ex gas.  In terms of the core margin on its own sales, in Q2, our core-on-core margin, if you will, was lower by 28 basis points year-over-year. Approximately 2/3 of this coming from fresh foods and a little from foods and sundries and nonfoods as well.  Fresh continues to lap exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outside sales a year ago in the second quarter. Ancillary and other business gross margin was higher by 40 basis points and by 49 ex gas in the quarter. Gas travel, business centers and pharmacy were all better year-over-year, offset by e-comm and optical. LIFO, we had a 14 basis point hit year-over-year to LIFO, or $71 million LIFO charge during the quarter, both with and without gas inflation. Recall that our Q1 LIFO charge year-over-year was $14 million or in the first quarter was $14 million or a 3 basis point delta versus the prior year.  It's been the last three fiscal quarters that we've actually pointed out LIFO as we saw a little bit of inflation going back to December or Q4 of fiscal '21, a little more in Q1 of this fiscal year. And as with everything you read in the news, quite a bit more in Q2. Our 2% reward was higher on a reported basis by 3% and minus 1%, excluding gas inflation, a reflection of increased penetration of the 2% reward executive members and other was plus 14 basis points year-over-year. This is related to the COVID-related costs from a year ago, about $60 million. That's the portion of COVID-related wages that go into cost of sales that like related to manufacturing businesses as well as their meat and bakery departments. Overall, a pretty good showing on the gross margin, given the ongoing and increasing inflationary pressures. Moving to expenses, to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the second quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 94 basis points, and better by 63 basis points, excluding gas inflation, Again, jotting down two columns of numbers reported and the second one, ex gas inflation. Operations, plus 36 basis points and plus 9. Here, a plus is good. It means it's lower year-over-year. Central, plus 13, plus 10; stock compensation, plus 3 and plus 2; other, plus 42 and plus 42, for a total of plus 94 and plus 63. So better or lower by 94 basis points reported and better or lower by 63 basis points ex gas inflation. Now again, looking at the first line item, operations. The core operations component, better again by 36, but as well better by 9 or lower by 9 basis points, excluding the impact of gas inflation. Keep in mind that this improvement occurred despite both the permanent dollar an hour wage increase that began in March of 2021 is now anniversary-ing and the additional starting wage increases from our 2 basic hourly scale service assisted and services by an additional $0.50 an hour, that occurred in October of 2021.  Central, better by 13 basis points or 10 ex gas inflation. It's pretty straightforward operating leverage on strong sales figures. Stock comp, plus 2 and plus 2, again, a reflection of good sales. And other, this plus 42 basis points, this was the $2 COVID wages of $186 million that goes into SG&A in Q2 a year ago. So again, on a year-over-year basis, that was that improvement.  In terms of preopening expenses in past conference calls, really since we went public, I think, we've covered that preopening expenses next on this discussion. Starting this fiscal year, going forward, preopening is now included in SG&A. The year-over-year change in SG&A related to preopening was flat year-over-year, no basis point delta year-over-year in the second quarter. All told, reported operating income in Q2 increased 35% on a reported basis, coming in at $1,812 million this year compared to $1,340 million a year ago in the second quarter.  Below the operating income line, interest expense was $36 million this year versus $40 million last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $6 million year-over-year, $25 million this year versus $19 million last year, primarily due to favorable FX. Overall, reported pretax income in the quarter was up 37%, coming in at $1.801 billion compared to $1.319 billion a year earlier.  In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q2 was slightly higher than it was in Q2 a year ago. It came in at 26.7% compared to 26.4% a year ago in the second quarter. Our effective tax rate is currently -- it continues to be projected to be in the 26% to 27% range for the fiscal year.  A few other items of note. Warehouse expansion. For the year, we now plan to have 32 new units and 32 units, including 4 relocations. So replacing existing units to larger and better located facilities. So net total of 28. I think a quarter ago, we actually said it was a net total of 27, so 1 more than that. However, remember, several of these are slotted to open in Q4, our fiscal Q4, 1 of them or 14 net new. So there's always a potential for 1 of those to shift into the next fiscal year.  The five openings in Q2 that we had, one each in Mexico or 40th in Mexico, our second in France, our second in China, our fourth in Spain and 1 additional unit in Florida, where we now have 29 locations. Regarding capital expenditures, our Q2 spend for CapEx was approximately $723 million, and our full year CapEx spend is still estimated to be approximately $4.0 billion.  Moving on to e-commerce. E-commerce sales in Q2 ex FX, as I mentioned earlier, increased 12.6% year-over-year. And that's, of course, on top of a second quarter fiscal '21 increase of 75% increase last year, benefiting, of course, from COVID. Stronger departments in e-commerce in terms of year-over-year percentage increases, jewelry, tires, special or kiosk items, patio and garden and home furnishings. Our largest online merchandise department majors, which consists of consumer electronics, appliances, TVs, et cetera, was up in the high single digits on very strong sales increases a year earlier. In terms of an update on Costco Logistics, that continues to drive big and bulky sales for the quarter. Deliveries were up year-over-year, 22%, and now about 85% of our U.S. e-comm less than truckload shipments from Costco Logistics, we're doing ourselves. Average during the quarter, we averaged more than 65,000 stops per week with Costco Logistics, which translates into a little over $3 million planned drops in Costco Logistics for the fiscal year.  In terms of e-comm and mobile apps, it continues to improve, much improved layout the ability to view warehouse receipts online, the ability to reschedule e-com deliveries in the U.S. and Canada as well as reschedule returns pickups. Later this month, we'll have our warehouse inventory along with the Instacart inventory online, and be able to see all the detail of our in-line in-store merchandise as well. In terms of our e-commerce platform, Costco Next, we added a few additional suppliers. So we now have 37 suppliers online and growing. Again, Costco Next has about 1,000 items on it, curated items at Costco Values. Please give it a -- check it out.  From a supply chain perspective, similar issues that we outlined, both 12 and 24 weeks ago on the past quarterly earnings calls, the factors pressuring supply chains and inflation include port delays, container shortages, COVID disruptions, shortages of various components and raw materials and ingredients and supplies, labor cost pressures, of course, as well as truck and driver shortages.  Overall, we've done a pretty good job of giving the supply chain challenges. I think that's evidenced in our sales strength. They continue to be delayed to container arrivals, so we continue to advance order in many cases as we are able to. Virtually all departments are impacted, less product and packaging challenges, but still a few. Still some limitations on key items, but again, that's improving a little. Chip shortages are still 1 of the things that are impacting many items, some more than others. But again, we're managing temporal and driving sales.  One of the things that we've done that I mentioned last quarter, I mentioned we had chartered 3 small container vessels to help provide us with additional flexibility on shipping. We have now charged a total of 7 ocean vessels, up from those 3 -- for the next 3 years. And these are the transport 'containers between Asia and the U.S. and Canada. We've also leased containers for use in these ships. With these additions, about 1/4 of our annual trans-Pacific containers and shipment needs are being accommodated this way, which gives us additional supply chain flexibility.  Despite all the supply chain issues, we're staying in stock and continue to work to mitigate cost and price increases as best we can. From every day and every week, you're going to see in different items in different departments, certain things on allocation or short, but other things are filling its place. And again, some things are seeming to get a little better.  Moving to inflation. Inflation, of course, continues, as evidenced by our LIFO charge. The inflationary pressures that we and others continue to see include higher labor costs, higher freight costs as well as higher transportation demand. Along with the container shortages and port lays that I just mentioned. Increased demand in certain product categories, various shortages of everything from computer chips to oils chemicals to resins.  Higher commodity prices from foodservice oils to additives and motor oils to plastics to detergents to paper products as well on the fresh side, proteins and butter and eggs and things like that. Not very different than what you hear and read and see from others. But again, we think we've done a pretty good job of corralling it as best we can.  For first quarter, a quarter ago, I mentioned that we estimated, at that time, overall price inflation to have been in the 4.5% to 5% range for the second quarter and talking with senior merchants, estimated overall price inflation was in the 6% range. All of this said, again, I want to give another shout-out to the job that our merchants and our traffic department and operators have all been able to do to keep -- in order to keep the products that we need pivot when and where necessary, keep our warehouses full like keeping prices as low as we can for our members and continue to show great value versus our competitors.  Now turning to our February sales results, the 4 weeks ended this past Sunday, February 27, compared to the same 4-week period a year ago. As reported in our release, net sales for the month of February came in at $16.29 billion, an increase of 15.9% from $14.05 billion a year earlier. Recall from January sales results that Lunar New Year, Chinese New Year occurred on February 1. That's 11 days earlier this past -- this year than last. This shift negatively impacted February's Other International by about 4 percentage points? And total company by about 0.5? Percentage point. Comparable sales for the 4 weeks on a reported basis, U.S. was 17.4%, ex gas and FX 12.9%; Canada reported 11.7%, ex gas and FX 8.8; Other international, minus 0.9% and ex gas and FX, a 1.3% to the positive. Total company, 14% and 10.6%, and e-comm within that number is 10.2% reported and 10.4% ex gas and FX.  Our comp traffic and frequency for February was up 8% worldwide and 8.2% in the United States. Foreign currencies year-over-year relative to the dollar negatively impacted total and comp sales as follows: Canada by approximately 0.2%, Other International by approximately 4.5% and total company by approximately 0.7%. Gas price inflation positively impacted total reported comps by about 4% and average worldwide selling price per gallon was up year-over-year by 37%.  Worldwide, the average transaction for February was up 5.5%. Our U.S. regions with the strongest sales were Texas, the Southeast and the Northeast. Other international and local currencies saw the strongest results in Australia, Mexico and the U.K.  Moving to merchandise highlights for the month of February. Food and synergies was -- came in at a positive high single digits, fresh foods in the mid-single digits and nonfoods and deposit of high single digits. Ancillary businesses sales were up mid-40s and with gas being certainly a driver of that as well as food court and hearing aids were the top performers.  With that, I want to mention just a couple of recent executive changes. A month ago, we reported that Ron Vachris became President of Costco. Ron started his career 39 years ago at Price Company and Price Club at the young age of 17. Most of his career was in operations through 2015. Then he spent a little over a year in real estate traveling the world and working on both worldwide and domestic expansion. And since that time, in 2016 has been in merchandising with certainly responsibly, not only for in-line merchandising, but online merchandising as well as very involved with logistics and transportation.  As well, just this week, internally, we reported that taking Ron's previous spot is Head of Merchandising is Claudine Adamo. Claudine has been with us for 30 years. She began in an hourly position in our Kirkland warehouse in 1992, 30 years ago. But a year later, he came into buying and has been buying ever since and most recently was Senior VP of nonfood sales -- of nonfoods merchandising. And again, he'll be taking over -- looking overall of merchandising.  Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our March sales results for the 5 weeks ending April 3, on Sunday, April 3, on Wednesday, April 6 after the markets close.  With that, I will open it up to Q&A and turn it back to Jerome. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Good afternoon. Richard, thanks a lot for taking my question. First one is on the fee increase for the potential for a fee increase. if there is no increase this year, should the market interpret that as some reflection of how Costco - either? I think power, especially in light of companies like Amazon and Netflix raising their fees this year? Or should we interpret a sign as the interval with Costco [indiscernible]\nRichard Galanti: Well, certainly, I don't think you should interpret anything related to why or when. Historically, we always look at things like do we feel we can -- we look at ourselves in the mirror, do we feel that we've continued to increase the value of the membership. Certainly, we look at renewal rates we look less at what others do, frankly, but certainly is out there what others are doing. And what I do note is that I looked at the last three increases over the last 15 years, and on average, they were done about every 5.5 -- a little over every 5.5 years, about five years and seven months. And five years from the anniversary of the June of '17 would be this June. So I think the question will continue to be asked until we do or don't do something. But at the end of the day, we certainly feel very good about our member loyalty our success in getting members to move to executive member, which are the most loyal. And so you guys will know when we tell you, and at some point, it will happen, but stay tuned.\nMichael Lasser: My follow-up question is on the core-on-core gross margin. Over the last couple of quarters, you've given back about 1/3 of the core-on-core gross margin gains at Costco during the hardest times like over probably the last couple of years. Is this the right way to think about what's sustainable from here? You may give back 1/3 [indiscernible]. Alternatively, would you expect your growth?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Yes. Look, recognizing -- I'd like to think it was that easy that we could plan it and get there. Sometimes we get there, but 10 different variables go in 10 different directions than we had planned. There's lots of moving parts to it. The fact of the matter is we certainly have confidence in our competitive position and our confidence to get some margin as we go forth.  The fact of the matter is, our margins -- our gross margins are still even on core-on-core higher than they were two years ago. We had outsized margins two years ago, most particularly in fresh. When you had 20% and 30% increases in fresh, you darn near eliminated spoilage and \u2013 where are the 2s. Labor - you improved dramatically labor productivity in fresh. And you darn near eliminated all your spoilage. Some of that's not sustainable. So -- but even with some of the giveback, if you will, on a two-year stack, if you will, we've -- we're still showing higher year-over-year numbers on core-on-core.  The other thing is as we've said, and we don't sit around and just pound our chest on it. Despite these inflationary pressures, we've tried to hold where we can. Now needless to say you can't do that in near in its entirety. -- but we've probably been a little later than others in terms of raising some things in our view. We've worked with our suppliers to eat a little of it and we eat a little of it. And I think that these margins, particularly given the sales strength and the operating leverage, allow us to be ever more competitive and drive our business.  So when asked the question, as many of you know, over the years, who's our toughest competitor? It's us. And I don't really look at this as being a reflection of what's going on there. We're ever competitive. We're always checking our competition, and we feel that, that competitive - our competitive position is as strong as ever.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: Richard, I'd like to follow up on the core-on-core question just asked differently. About, I could say, a year ago, supply chain costs were rising, input costs are rising, and it felt like you were not ahead of it. And in the last two quarters, it seems like you're now more ahead of it. You feel better. You called out the two-year trend in the core on core. So does it feel like we are past the worst and that you're able to either move pricing or have some visibility on supply chain?  And then related to the perishable piece, it sounds like you're going to keep some efficiencies. So there is a reason to believe that some of this, you will keep going forward? I don't know if that's fair or not.\nRichard Galanti: Yes certainly, on the fresh and the fact that we're at higher sales levels, that allows for higher labor productivity and hopefully a little lower D&D or spoilage. I don't disagree with what you say, but there's -- never know what's going to happen tomorrow. I know that for 35 years, when things get better, we figure out how to give a little more of it back. And certainly, right now, with all the inflation, first and foremost, is getting merchandise on the shelves and then mitigating those various cost components as much as you can, which is not a lot. And again, but hopefully being as, if not a little more competitive than others.\nSimeon Gutman: And maybe a follow-up, I'd love to take on the price gaps out there. It feels like every company we cover in the mass space, supermarket space, they're all pleased with price gaps. And yet, I'm not sure -- I don't know if that's right or wrong, and we're seeing gross margins actually start to go up in some places. So it seems like companies, your competition, they're taking price, that would imply that the gaps actually should be widening and making you more valuable. Curious, I know you guys have folks running around stores a lot. Curious what's your take on it?\nRichard Galanti: Well, we like when they feel more comfortable, frankly. Look, our most direct competitor is Sam's. We -- and I'm sure they do to do comp shops every week in every \u2013 darn near every location. We feel good about those gaps. It's not that they've widened or shrunk that overall, they're a tough competitor, and so are we.  As it rates to other traditional, yes, you've seen -- I think we've called out strength in gas business. I think overall, what I read externally about gross margins in retail gas by the supermarkets and others is up. And there's a little bit more -- that gives us breathing room as well. But we want to be ever more competitive.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Grom from Gordon Haskett.\nCharles Grom: Richard. Over the past few months, you guys have had success raising retails. And I'm wondering if that trend has continued? Or if you're starting to see some limits or demand destruction in any parts of the club.\nRichard Galanti: Not no, and we haven't. I think certainly, the more inflation creates some demand pressure. I'd like to think some of that inflation or wanting to shop across and save more frankly. But we haven't seen that. \nCharles Grom: Okay. Okay. Great. And then just another near-term question. Historically, I'm wondering if with gas prices where they are and where they're likely to go. I heard today, California is close to $5. Historically, has there really been a tipping point? And how it impacts traffic for you guys? I understand how it impacts the margin structure of your business, but historically, is there a tipping point for you?\nRichard Galanti: We haven't seen that. The only time in my recollection is a number of years ago, when prices got to $4, $5, Alan, and like then and now, we see our gallons improve relatively speaking because we're still the cheapest game. At some point, if it goes to 5 people stop driving a little bit, it's hard to state. I'd like to think that the hybrid models of working has helped a little bit there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citi.\nBrandon Cheatham: This is Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. I was wondering, are you seeing any change in consumer behavior such as trade down or maybe trade to private label brands anything of that nature?\nRichard Galanti: It's interesting. On the one hand, the only thing I can think of is in fresh when there's been big fluctuations in prices or big increase in prices on beef relative to chicken or something, you'll see some trade down within the protein family. Other than that, a couple of anomalies that are perverse in the sense that it's almost just the opposite. We've seen strength in jewelry and in big-ticket furniture items and the like. And more conversions to executive membership, which, again, there's more value long term to that customer, but it's adding $60 to their fee. SP-7 Got it.\nBrandon Cheatham: And just a point of clarification on price inflation. Has that moderated the past couple of months as I think some of your monthly updates have indicated? Or are you still seeing that accelerate?\nRichard Galanti: Has not moderated. It continues to go up.\nBrandon Cheatham: Got it.\nRichard Galanti: Now it's going up perhaps at a little less so. The bigger slope was probably 4 to 2 months ago, and it's gone up from there. I think if I recall, there was a little low -- talking to the buyers a little low in the last couple of months of the year. But many suppliers are already talking back 2 months prior to that to come January, we'll be coming back and talking to you again.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from Truist Securities.\nScot Ciccarelli: So Richard, you guys are running with nearly double the cash balance that you historically would have run with kind of prepandemic. Obviously, there's still a lot of uncertainty in the market I guess the question is because we've seen this pattern for probably 8-plus quarters now to continue to run with much higher cash levels than what you historically have. Or should we start thinking about the potential return of capital to shareholders like you've done periodically?\nRichard Galanti: Well, at some point, we'll figure out what to do. And mind you, our Q2 balance sheet, Q 2 and balance sheet is probably the highest point from a seasonal standpoint because you've built a lot of sales and you still have some of the bills to pay from the Christmas time, not a lot, but some. And frankly, knock on wood, our operating cash flow has certainly exceeded what we had expected 2 years ago. So yes, there is a little more. At some point, certainly, one of the arrows in our quiver is a special dividend along with the regular dividend increase that we've done every year, as well as some stock buybacks.  But first and foremost is CapEx. CapEx this year of $4-ish plus million is up from the $3 million, $3.5 million over the last couple of years and up from numbers lower than that, the 2 to 4 years prior to that. So that's, first and foremost, what we want to spend money on. But we've done 4 specials and as one of the Board members said as we are a little quirky and it seems to have worked for us. So it's certainly an arrow in a quiver, but we haven't made any decision at this point.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays.\nKaren Short: I just wanted to ask the membership fee question a little differently. So in the past, you've talked about raising the membership fee in the context that you obviously have an inflow of dollars to then reinvest in price. So I guess the question is, maybe with the assumption that consumer is going to continue to feel a little more and more stretched as the year progresses, how does that factor into your thought process? And then also tying that in with the fact that there was obviously the increase in membership at Amazon.\nRichard Galanti: I think we -- that doesn't hurt, but at the -- honestly, at the end of the day, first and foremost, the factors that doesn't give us any concerns is the fact that our sales are strong. Our renewal rates and loyalty are at all-time highs. So that's all positive. And yes, when we do it, we use it to be even more competitive. So on the one hand, you might argue that because of inflation would this allow us to mitigate some of that. We're already doing that, by the way, without a fee increase. But we've done it 7 times in 35 years, and sometime between summer and 6 or 9 months down the road, is it likely? It's possible, but we'll have to wait and see. But we don't really consider what with Amazon or what we were asked the question the other way with some of our direct warehouse club competitors that theirs is -- they have not changed their in a number of years. And that does not concern us either. We look at what we're doing, how it affects our members -- and we look at ourselves in the Americas have we improved the value of the membership. And we've always felt that we've done that in a more dramatic fashion in these increases. And then we take those increases and use it to become even more competitive. So I cannot give you an answer other than we feel good about if and when we want to do it, we'll be able to\nKaren Short: Okay. And then my second question is just on the net income margin, or I guess you could talk about pretax margin. Obviously, that has come up quite a bit over the last several years. And I think the question on a lot of people's mind is just is there more of a willingness to flow through margin on that line? And I know, again, you don't run your business that way. You run it for [indiscernible] and volume and leverage on strong comps, but just wondering how you would frame that?\nRichard Galanti: Well, first of all, certainly in this quarter as well, the bottom line margin improvement was the sum of great expense improvement and some margin detriment, I'm taking out all the anomalies of each. And that's the way we want to do it. The old saying is we want to lower prices and raise margins. Same thing is we want to improve the bottom line while not raising prices. And I'm not talking about necessarily specific inflation right now. I think I recall a few of these -- of you on the call might remember this when we had our made first and last all hands all meeting out here with about 300 people.  And at the time, we had a 2.8% pretax return on sales, pretax. And our founder was up there saying that we're a great company and great companies deserve to make good money. And over the next several years, we wanted to go from 2.8 to a number. I won't get everybody excited, but a bigger number. And at the end of the day, it went up and down, but it has improved. I think that -- we got a lot of great things going on. We're not embarrassed to make money for our shareholders as well, but we're going to do it within the confines of being ever more competitive from a pricing and value standpoint to our members.\nOperator: Your next question goes from the line of Chris Horvers from JP Morgan.\nChristopher Horvers: I guess my first question is, do you look at the U.S. sort of core comp on a 2- and 3-year basis? Really, since the summer, there's been a bit more volatility to the 2 and 3 year trends even over the past few months, do you read into that? How much do you think that was maybe just like a holiday shift, maybe some Omicron impact in January. Curious how you're thinking about that.\nRichard Galanti: It would be the all-inclusive yes. It's all of the above. I remember when we had particularly strong early in the Christmas holidays, Thanksgiving, Christmas holiday season. We had strength. Part of that was bringing in some things early. Part of it was this increased demand that COVID has created for goods for the home and the shortages of those same goods. And so once they hit the shelves, you sold quickly.  And then, of course, it was a little -- it was still positive, but a little less than that trend at the end of the calendar year. And without doing a lot of work, it seemed like that was the reason. Then you've got storms that affect the things. You've got shifts and things like Chinese and Lunar New Year. We really don't spend a lot of time doing that. We try to understand why overall something -- some level of sales either generally reduced increase, we don't worry about it as much. And -- but I don't think we spend a lot of time thinking about that. We're -- as we've been reminded from the day of our founding, we're a top line company and it's all about driving sales and value. And it's going to be as good as we can get it. And -- so we don't read a lot into what you asked.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. It's a good segue. I guess your executive trends, the renewal rates, the comps, the traffic you're one of the few big retailers with really strong traffic. But at the same time, is there a point where just the culture becomes uncomfortable with passing through price? I mean the vendors have talked about more price increases that have come starting January 1. It seems like there's more coming in September. I could think of Jim sort of being paranoid and worried about do we just push too far and do we not want to risk that and invest more in price before even seeing any deterioration in the sales trends?\nRichard Galanti: I would say we're more aggressive when things are good, and -- we're aggressive when things are good and bad. I remember somebody years ago asked the question, given that sales for whatever reason, had been weak for a month or 2. And that was more the reason to be even more strong on pricing. And I think actually had related to a pending membership fee increase based on this kind of 5-plus year anniversary. And the view was, no, our members are loyal and we're going to use it to drive more sales. So no, I don't -- I think we're still boarded that same DNA of trying to constantly drive more value and not worry about how strong or weak we are today, just keep driving more value and if we keep focusing on that, nobody can catch us.\nChristopher Horvers: And just one quick one -- sorry, say that again?\nRichard Galanti: It's harder to catch us at least.\nChristopher Horvers: Yes. And then just a quick question on LIFO. If price increases have continued into this year, does that LIFO number should stay at this level? And as we lap through it, do we actually get that back?\nRichard Galanti: Well, in theory, you don't get it back. If -- as I said earlier, if inflation is continuing, you should see some additional LIFO charges, maybe not as big, but who knows. And at some point, at the beginning, as you start a new fiscal year, you've had whatever LIFO charge you'll have for this past year. And those -- that's kind of the new set point for costs for each item.  And then to the extent if there's additional inflation relative to that starting point, you'll have some additional IPO next year. If things came down a little bit, let's say things -- I'm making these numbers up in the extreme. But things were up in 1 year, 20% and the next year, they were down 10%. You had a big LIFO charge this year, and you actually have some LIFO credit in the following year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Baker from DA Davidson.\nMichael Baker: Okay. I guess I'll stay on the inflation question, but ask 2 different inflation questions. One, if prices do come down, eventually, they will. Historically, what do you see in terms of your ability to maintain the comp prices, in other words, not to come down and then to gain some margin in that sense.  And then a second inflation-related question. Historically, when you see outsized inflation now it's been a long time since we've seen inflation like this, but you've been around for a long time. When you see inflation, do you get more customers coming in to Costco to save money? You alluded to that earlier, you said that's what you hope happens. But I guess I'm sure you've looked at it historically, what have you seen?\nRichard Galanti: On the Atlanta question, past history has indicated, yes, not in a big way, but the answer is yes, directionally. As it relates to if prices come down, if our costs come down, we want to be the first to lower the price, period.\nMichael Baker: Okay. That makes sense. One last one, if I could. Similar to that, do you get more customers on in an inflationary environment. Do you see more customers wanting to sign up to take advantage of your value in a tougher economic situation? In other words, in 2022, no stimulus does appear as if the economy might not be or at least the consumer economy might not be as strong as last year. How does that impact your memberships or renewal rates?\nRichard Galanti: I think if you asked us two years ago, how would the next two years be in terms of new member sign-ups, we would be positive. But we probably have achieved greater than those expected -- than our own expectations, by a little. And so arguably that it was not just the stimulus, but notwithstanding the stimulus, there wasn't a lot of positive feelings out there in terms of the consumer and we did just fine.  So one of the good things that we've been blessed with that we are the extreme value proposition, and it generally bodes well for us in good and bad economic times. And so I think we don't pay a lot of attention to it other than really being focused on driving price and value of our products and services and taking care of the customer and then the rest seems to work.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer.\nRupesh Parikh: So I had a question just on the labor front. I was just curious what you guys are seeing from a labor availability standpoint? And then what your comfort is with your wage levels in the marketplace, just given we continue to see others raise their wages?\nRichard Galanti: Well, we continue to raise them as others have, and we will continue to do that. The biggest single area of challenge is, one, we're headquartered in Seattle, which has become an increasingly expensive market. And within that, IT, where you not only have 3 big-hits, but the next 3 tech behemoths all have 10,000 to 20,000 employees in this town as well. So we've had to raise wages there and didn't happen overnight in the last 2 weeks. It's happened continually over the last couple of years.  And we will also lose a few people because we're not 100% work from home. We have a -- we think, a good fair hybrid work model. But for some -- a few, they want that. Overall, though, if you look at our total compensation and benefits package, 90% of our employees are hourly in the warehouse. And we -- while maybe there's a city or 2 where we've got to occasionally start it 1 step above the entry level, we've continued to raise the wages, as I mentioned in the thing and we'll do it again.\nRupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. And then maybe 1 additional question. Just on the ancillary front, if you can just remind us where you are with your recovery versus pre-pandemic and some of the more challenged categories travel, food core, et cetera?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Well, the biggest one is gas, and that's gone nothing but up. And again, as I mentioned earlier, the retail competitive price pressure is probably lessened over the last couple of years. TravelU mentioned is 1 that has been extreme ups and downs. There was a period during the mid-2020 year lockouts -- as COVID lockouts, where we had negative -- we had lost money in the business and had negative revenues because you're getting more cancellations and no new orders, and that fluctuate. It's come back. It fell a little bit with Delta. It came back after that. It fell a little bit with Omnicom, although now we seem to be upon the upward trend, and it is profitable, not as profitable as it was 2 years ago. but continue in that direction. Huge business and both vacation packages as well as auto renewal -- rental cars and the like.  So that's a business that's coming out nicely. It was businesses like where there's face-to-face touch, if you will, with -- in our hearing aid and optical shops. That was actually closed for a number of weeks in the mid-2020. But just for 10 or 15 weeks, I think, that's come back as well. Food courts have come back because we have shares in tables back out and we expanded the menu. So overall, a few of those ancillary business, they're not back to where they were, but they're getting there. And then, of course, the one business that dwarfs all the other is gas, just in its size and its increased profitability. So overall, ancillary is doing fine and some of the ones that were hurt the most are picking up.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital.\nKelly Bania: Follow-up real quickly on the gas. Richard, you made the comment about gas margins going up kind of across the space. Can you help us understand a little bit about how Costco's gas margins are relative to 2019? Are they up, maybe just up a little less? And where are we with gallons versus 2019?\nRichard Galanti: I don't have that detail in front of me. Margins are up, prices are up, and it's a huge business. It's a little more than 10% of our sales. It's a $20-plus million business now. Recognizing there's been, as I mentioned earlier, a 30-plus percent increase in just the price per gallon. But it's definitely been up the last couple of years and it's less volatile than it was 5 and 10 years ago in terms of a big margin fluctuation. But I don't have the detail like 2 years ago.\nKelly Bania: Okay. I'll just ask another one just on white space then, just in the U.S. Just curious if you can just give us an update on how you're looking at that today over the next couple of years, do you have to at all change your target demographics or target population density in terms of where you'll plan on opening up new clubs in the U.S., just the eventual number that you see, just an update there.\nRichard Galanti: Sure. I mean if you had asked me 5 years ago, how many -- 5 years hence or now how many -- what would it look like 5 years ago, we were opening about 25 a year, call it, 26 to make the math easy for a second. And maybe 70-30 U.S. and Canada, our most successful mature -- most mature markets. And then over the next 5 or 10 years, the 70-30 would probably go to 60-40 outside of the U.S. and Canada. And here we are 5 years into that incorrect answer, and we're pretty 65, 35 U.S. Canada for 2 reasons. Partly is our expectations of what we can do in the U.S. and Canada has increased, not just in the last 5 years, but in general, over many years; and it's taken a little longer the time lines internationally, although we've got more feet on the ground and more stuff looking.  So if you ask me today, I look 5 years from now, we'll go from 65-35 or whatever excess today, probably down to 50-50 I think the good news with that answer from that perspective is, is that we feel we still have plenty of opportunities in the U.S. and Canada, and we've ramped up our activities to do more in these other countries where we've also been quite successful.  The -- if you said -- asked over the next 10 years, we're opening, I think, this year, 16 of our 28 are in the U.S. I could be off by 1 or 2. Our view is there's no reason to think for the next 10 years, we can't open 15-or-so a year in the U.S. Now mind you, 1 or 2 of those are growing to 2 or 3 will be the business centers. We now have 22 business centers in the U.S. and 5 in Canada. That's been a good adjunct to our business. But we're also -- and we're infilling I gave an example at an internal meeting yesterday, and I've given it before to you guys.  In San Jose, about 4 or 5 years ago, we opened our fourth in the Greater San Jose market. At the time, the 3 units were doing about 250 each. Now the 4 units are averaging right at 300 each averaging. And on fewer members per location because you've got existing members driving less far, so there's a combination of infill. Now we're in 46 states, so there's not a lot of additional states. We're less penetrated versus our direct competitors in certain locations in the Midwest and Texas, South and parts of the Southeast, and we're still opening there as well. So it really is a combination of all those things. I think our view is the good news is that there's still -- we're far from saturating our most saturated markets. And we've upped the adding in terms of feet on the ground, the real estate feet on the ground, if you will, in terms of getting some more into the pipeline.\nOperator: Your next question as from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim.\nJohn Heinbockel: Richard, first thing, philosophically, how do you guys think about closing the gap on the two membership tiers, right? Maybe encouraging some further conversion to executive. And I don't know if you've done any kind of work with your current executive members, what would they like in the membership that's not there today, right, that perhaps might just make it might help you take the monthly -- the annual fee higher.\nRichard Galanti: Yes. A lot, I don't know exactly what we ask. I need to ask our membership marketing people. I think we've frankly been very pleased of our success of getting more existing -- more new members -- more existing members to convert and frankly, more new members to sign up initially as an executive. Mind you, 8 or 10 years ago, in the U.S. where it started, we've had it for 15 years now, probably. You came in and we just signed job, we asked you what you wanted. We didn't do a lot in maybe 20 or 25, at most 25 of every 100 signed up as an executive member. Today, it's in the 50s, closing in -- close to 60, and that's with just trying a little bit and showing them the value of it.  So I think we've done a better job of doing that. We do a better job when we go into a new country, we're now in I think 5 of our -- 6 of our countries, which are the largest ones. You want to have at least 15 or so locations before you're looking at it to put an executive membership on it. So we've toyed with the idea of having something even higher than the executive, but we always go back to the fact that what we have works very well. And so I don't think there's anything currently on our plate to change that.  We're always -- we've also asked the question, at some point, right now at 72% or 73% of our sales over the executive member, what happens when it gets to 85 or 90, do you eliminate the lower membership. At some point, we might, but that's, again, not in the cards at any time in the near future. We kind of like to what we're doing, it's working fine.\nJohn Heinbockel: And secondly, where are you on the personalization journey? I know you hired somebody maybe 2 years ago to kind of spearhead that. Where are we in does that pick up steam in the next year or so?\nRichard Galanti: I think it picks up, Stephen, in the next year or so. The first order of business, when we brought in people on that data analytics side 2 years ago, a person, he has built a great team. And we're seeing small deliverables, first and foremost, not online, but with the merchants and to a smaller extent, with some of the operators. And there's been some real deliverables that have saved our buyers' time and those are in the process of being rolled out.  On the personalization and targeting, I think we've got a little better targeting and that -- and still have a journey on the personalization, but that will be coming. But I thank you for asking it when you said a year or two. We'll take two more questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine from Loop Capital.\nLaura Champine: I'll make it quick. To follow on to the unit growth questions asked earlier, but it sounds like you're positioning the business to launch more international stores. Is it -- does it make sense for me to interpret that as unit growth may accelerate next fiscal year and beyond from this looks like it's going to be about 3.5% this year.\nRichard Galanti: Well, look, our goal for the last several years, there was the unique year of COVID where we went down to 13 openings because there were several that construction had stopped for several months in the middle of 2020. But the reality is, if you go back 5 or 6 years, we were opening 25-ish, some of the years 21 or 22-ish. And the view even then was to get up to closer to 30, certainly 25% to 30%. I think this year is we're finally hitting that with the expectation of 28 in my call this morning and call it, 26 to 30, whatever it comes out to be. And we would certainly be comfortable at 30.  One of the things that is unique is we try to be relatively methodical about it, particularly in new international markets. Once you open the first one, if it's successful, you're taking some people from that one, to help and succeed in opening the second one.  One of the things is it's the biggest cost factor on warehouse P&L is labor and efficiency. And when you're running a high-volume unit, it's helpful when you've got more people coming over from a nearby unit. So we are pretty methodical about growing somewhat slowly in new markets. We went from 1 to 5 20 years ago, over a 5-year period in Japan. We've sped up a little in China, thinking that we've opened 2 now in 3 years, and with another several in process and a couple more. So we've increased it a little bit. But we feel pretty good about that. So I would still say our rounded pat answer right now is 25% to 30%, and we'd like it to be more to 30 than 25 right now. But we're not necessarily looking at that percentage. As we get bigger, God willing and year 6 through 10, we're going to be talking about 30% to 35%, but we'll have to wait and see.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Peter Benedict from Baird.\nPeter Benedict: So my questions have been asked. But just thinking about the supply chain situation and just curious if it's caused you guys to rethink or accelerate any of your kind of sourcing initiatives. I mean, you talked about the vessels and the containers, and that clearly seems to be in reaction to what's going on. But I'm thinking more along the lines of categories, these efforts you've been underway for a long time going vertical. Are there any that maybe have jumped to the front of the line because of what you've seen over the last year?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think a couple of things we've got, not in a big way, but a couple of things we've done is there's probably a little bit more diversification of suppliers, particularly on huge $300 million to $1 billion SKUs. You need a little bit more there. We've brought in certain things -- nontraditional to its season during the winter bringing in bikes because we could have access to them, and we sold them. Yes, new countries of origin. So there's a few of those things, but not in a big way. Part of our success is huge buying power per item and having less than 4,000 SKUs to do our $200 billion is quite a bit different than having even 100,000 SKUs doing $150 billion to $500 billion, depending on who the retailer is. So we've made changes, and we are more open-minded to bringing in some things. But hopefully, this thing the supply chain works out over the next couple of years in a big way, in a better way.\nPeter Benedict: Sure. And then just lastly, the executive membership, 43% of the members and 7% of the sales. How -- where are those numbers? And maybe your more established markets where you've had it? And maybe how underpenetrated is it in some of the newer markets? Just trying to get a sense of what the pathway might be for some of these newer markets.\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Well, it's like renewal rates. Renewal rates, irrespective of what it becomes 10 years hence in a location than in the market, it starts off at a lower number and builds up to the higher number. Same thing with that executive transition. We're doing better today and even in first year new markets. I think in the last couple of years, where we added executive Japan and Korea. And -- what? Yes, I mean that 42% number is hovering in the low 50s, 50 or a little higher in more mature markets. and starts off lower in other markets, but higher than it started in the previous new market a few years ago, so it grows over time. Well, thank you very much. Everyone, have a good afternoon and evening, and I appreciate you getting on the call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Galanti",
            "content": "Thank you, Jerome, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law.  In today's press release, we reported operating results for the second quarter of fiscal '22, the 12 weeks ended this past February 13, as well as February retail results for the four weeks ended this past Sunday, February 27.  Net income for the quarter came in at $1,299 million or $2.92 per diluted share. Last year's second quarter net income came in at $951 million or $2.14 per diluted share. That latter number included a $246 million pretax or $0.41 per share costs, incurred primarily from COVID-19 premium wages.  Net income for the 24 weeks was $2.62 billion or $5.90 per share compared to $2.12 billion or $4.76 per diluted share last year in the first half. Net sales for the quarter increased 16.1% to $50.94 billion, up from $43.89 billion last year in the second quarter. Comparable sales in the second quarter for fiscal '22, on a reported basis, U.S. sales increase during the 12-week period was 15.8%, excluding gas inflation, 11.3%; Canada, 16% reported, 12.4% ex-gas inflation and FX; other International, 6.2%; and plus 9% ex-gas inflation and FX for the total company reported number of 14.4% on a same-store comparable basis and up 11.1%, excluding gas inflation effects. E-commerce, on a reported basis, up 12.5% and FX, up 12.6%.  In terms of our second quarter comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 9.3% worldwide and up 8.3% year-over-year in the quarter in the United States. Our average transaction or ticket was up 4.6% worldwide and up 6.9% in the U.S. during the second quarter. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 60 basis points, while gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 390 basis points. I will review our February sales results later in the call.  Going down our second quarter fiscal 2022 income statement. Membership fee income reported came in at $967 million, up $86 million or up 9.8% from a year earlier, $881 million. There was about a $6.5 million impact -- negative impact due to FX. So on an ex FX basis, if you will, the $86 million increase would have been up $92 million or 10.4%.  In terms of renewal rates, they continue to increase. At second quarter-end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate stood at 92.0%, up 0.4 percentage point from the 12-week earlier Q1 end. And worldwide rate, it came in at 89.6%, up 0.6% from where it stood 12 weeks earlier at Q1 end. Our renewal rates are continuing to benefit from more members' auto renewing as well as increased penetration of executive members who on average renew at a higher rate than nonexecutive members, and higher first year renewal rates for our new members. In terms of the number of members at second quarter-end, member households and total cardholders. Total households was $63.4 million, up 900,000 from the $62.5 million just 12 weeks earlier. And total cardholders at Q2 end, $114.8 million, up $1.7 million from the $113.1 million figure 12 weeks ago.  At second quarter-end, paid executive memberships stood at $27.1 million, an increase of $644,000 during the 12-week period since Q1 end. Executive members, by the way, represent now 42.7% of our total membership base and 70.9% of our total sales.  Moving down to the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin in the second quarter was lower year-over-year by 32 basis points, but up 5 basis points, excluding gas inflation. As I always do, I'll ask you to judge on a few numbers, two columns. The first column is reported, the second column would be excluding gas inflation.  First line item, merchandise - core merchandise on a reported basis was down 75% -- 75 basis points year-over-year and ex gas inflation, down 43 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses reported plus 40 basis points and ex gas inflation, plus 49 basis points, 2% reward, plus 3 and minus 1 basis points; LIFO, minus 14 and minus 14 basis points; other plus 14 and plus 14 basis points. So totally, on a reported basis, again, year-over-year, minus 32 basis points and excluding gas inflation, plus 5 basis points. Now in terms of the core merchandise component being lower by 75% year-over-year reported and 43 -- minus 43 basis points ex gas inflation. Recall last year in Q2 that the core reported was plus 71 basis points in ex gas plus 63, so still improved to where we were two years ago, prepandemic and ex gas.  In terms of the core margin on its own sales, in Q2, our core-on-core margin, if you will, was lower by 28 basis points year-over-year. Approximately 2/3 of this coming from fresh foods and a little from foods and sundries and nonfoods as well.  Fresh continues to lap exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outside sales a year ago in the second quarter. Ancillary and other business gross margin was higher by 40 basis points and by 49 ex gas in the quarter. Gas travel, business centers and pharmacy were all better year-over-year, offset by e-comm and optical. LIFO, we had a 14 basis point hit year-over-year to LIFO, or $71 million LIFO charge during the quarter, both with and without gas inflation. Recall that our Q1 LIFO charge year-over-year was $14 million or in the first quarter was $14 million or a 3 basis point delta versus the prior year.  It's been the last three fiscal quarters that we've actually pointed out LIFO as we saw a little bit of inflation going back to December or Q4 of fiscal '21, a little more in Q1 of this fiscal year. And as with everything you read in the news, quite a bit more in Q2. Our 2% reward was higher on a reported basis by 3% and minus 1%, excluding gas inflation, a reflection of increased penetration of the 2% reward executive members and other was plus 14 basis points year-over-year. This is related to the COVID-related costs from a year ago, about $60 million. That's the portion of COVID-related wages that go into cost of sales that like related to manufacturing businesses as well as their meat and bakery departments. Overall, a pretty good showing on the gross margin, given the ongoing and increasing inflationary pressures. Moving to expenses, to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the second quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 94 basis points, and better by 63 basis points, excluding gas inflation, Again, jotting down two columns of numbers reported and the second one, ex gas inflation. Operations, plus 36 basis points and plus 9. Here, a plus is good. It means it's lower year-over-year. Central, plus 13, plus 10; stock compensation, plus 3 and plus 2; other, plus 42 and plus 42, for a total of plus 94 and plus 63. So better or lower by 94 basis points reported and better or lower by 63 basis points ex gas inflation. Now again, looking at the first line item, operations. The core operations component, better again by 36, but as well better by 9 or lower by 9 basis points, excluding the impact of gas inflation. Keep in mind that this improvement occurred despite both the permanent dollar an hour wage increase that began in March of 2021 is now anniversary-ing and the additional starting wage increases from our 2 basic hourly scale service assisted and services by an additional $0.50 an hour, that occurred in October of 2021.  Central, better by 13 basis points or 10 ex gas inflation. It's pretty straightforward operating leverage on strong sales figures. Stock comp, plus 2 and plus 2, again, a reflection of good sales. And other, this plus 42 basis points, this was the $2 COVID wages of $186 million that goes into SG&A in Q2 a year ago. So again, on a year-over-year basis, that was that improvement.  In terms of preopening expenses in past conference calls, really since we went public, I think, we've covered that preopening expenses next on this discussion. Starting this fiscal year, going forward, preopening is now included in SG&A. The year-over-year change in SG&A related to preopening was flat year-over-year, no basis point delta year-over-year in the second quarter. All told, reported operating income in Q2 increased 35% on a reported basis, coming in at $1,812 million this year compared to $1,340 million a year ago in the second quarter.  Below the operating income line, interest expense was $36 million this year versus $40 million last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $6 million year-over-year, $25 million this year versus $19 million last year, primarily due to favorable FX. Overall, reported pretax income in the quarter was up 37%, coming in at $1.801 billion compared to $1.319 billion a year earlier.  In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q2 was slightly higher than it was in Q2 a year ago. It came in at 26.7% compared to 26.4% a year ago in the second quarter. Our effective tax rate is currently -- it continues to be projected to be in the 26% to 27% range for the fiscal year.  A few other items of note. Warehouse expansion. For the year, we now plan to have 32 new units and 32 units, including 4 relocations. So replacing existing units to larger and better located facilities. So net total of 28. I think a quarter ago, we actually said it was a net total of 27, so 1 more than that. However, remember, several of these are slotted to open in Q4, our fiscal Q4, 1 of them or 14 net new. So there's always a potential for 1 of those to shift into the next fiscal year.  The five openings in Q2 that we had, one each in Mexico or 40th in Mexico, our second in France, our second in China, our fourth in Spain and 1 additional unit in Florida, where we now have 29 locations. Regarding capital expenditures, our Q2 spend for CapEx was approximately $723 million, and our full year CapEx spend is still estimated to be approximately $4.0 billion.  Moving on to e-commerce. E-commerce sales in Q2 ex FX, as I mentioned earlier, increased 12.6% year-over-year. And that's, of course, on top of a second quarter fiscal '21 increase of 75% increase last year, benefiting, of course, from COVID. Stronger departments in e-commerce in terms of year-over-year percentage increases, jewelry, tires, special or kiosk items, patio and garden and home furnishings. Our largest online merchandise department majors, which consists of consumer electronics, appliances, TVs, et cetera, was up in the high single digits on very strong sales increases a year earlier. In terms of an update on Costco Logistics, that continues to drive big and bulky sales for the quarter. Deliveries were up year-over-year, 22%, and now about 85% of our U.S. e-comm less than truckload shipments from Costco Logistics, we're doing ourselves. Average during the quarter, we averaged more than 65,000 stops per week with Costco Logistics, which translates into a little over $3 million planned drops in Costco Logistics for the fiscal year.  In terms of e-comm and mobile apps, it continues to improve, much improved layout the ability to view warehouse receipts online, the ability to reschedule e-com deliveries in the U.S. and Canada as well as reschedule returns pickups. Later this month, we'll have our warehouse inventory along with the Instacart inventory online, and be able to see all the detail of our in-line in-store merchandise as well. In terms of our e-commerce platform, Costco Next, we added a few additional suppliers. So we now have 37 suppliers online and growing. Again, Costco Next has about 1,000 items on it, curated items at Costco Values. Please give it a -- check it out.  From a supply chain perspective, similar issues that we outlined, both 12 and 24 weeks ago on the past quarterly earnings calls, the factors pressuring supply chains and inflation include port delays, container shortages, COVID disruptions, shortages of various components and raw materials and ingredients and supplies, labor cost pressures, of course, as well as truck and driver shortages.  Overall, we've done a pretty good job of giving the supply chain challenges. I think that's evidenced in our sales strength. They continue to be delayed to container arrivals, so we continue to advance order in many cases as we are able to. Virtually all departments are impacted, less product and packaging challenges, but still a few. Still some limitations on key items, but again, that's improving a little. Chip shortages are still 1 of the things that are impacting many items, some more than others. But again, we're managing temporal and driving sales.  One of the things that we've done that I mentioned last quarter, I mentioned we had chartered 3 small container vessels to help provide us with additional flexibility on shipping. We have now charged a total of 7 ocean vessels, up from those 3 -- for the next 3 years. And these are the transport 'containers between Asia and the U.S. and Canada. We've also leased containers for use in these ships. With these additions, about 1/4 of our annual trans-Pacific containers and shipment needs are being accommodated this way, which gives us additional supply chain flexibility.  Despite all the supply chain issues, we're staying in stock and continue to work to mitigate cost and price increases as best we can. From every day and every week, you're going to see in different items in different departments, certain things on allocation or short, but other things are filling its place. And again, some things are seeming to get a little better.  Moving to inflation. Inflation, of course, continues, as evidenced by our LIFO charge. The inflationary pressures that we and others continue to see include higher labor costs, higher freight costs as well as higher transportation demand. Along with the container shortages and port lays that I just mentioned. Increased demand in certain product categories, various shortages of everything from computer chips to oils chemicals to resins.  Higher commodity prices from foodservice oils to additives and motor oils to plastics to detergents to paper products as well on the fresh side, proteins and butter and eggs and things like that. Not very different than what you hear and read and see from others. But again, we think we've done a pretty good job of corralling it as best we can.  For first quarter, a quarter ago, I mentioned that we estimated, at that time, overall price inflation to have been in the 4.5% to 5% range for the second quarter and talking with senior merchants, estimated overall price inflation was in the 6% range. All of this said, again, I want to give another shout-out to the job that our merchants and our traffic department and operators have all been able to do to keep -- in order to keep the products that we need pivot when and where necessary, keep our warehouses full like keeping prices as low as we can for our members and continue to show great value versus our competitors.  Now turning to our February sales results, the 4 weeks ended this past Sunday, February 27, compared to the same 4-week period a year ago. As reported in our release, net sales for the month of February came in at $16.29 billion, an increase of 15.9% from $14.05 billion a year earlier. Recall from January sales results that Lunar New Year, Chinese New Year occurred on February 1. That's 11 days earlier this past -- this year than last. This shift negatively impacted February's Other International by about 4 percentage points? And total company by about 0.5? Percentage point. Comparable sales for the 4 weeks on a reported basis, U.S. was 17.4%, ex gas and FX 12.9%; Canada reported 11.7%, ex gas and FX 8.8; Other international, minus 0.9% and ex gas and FX, a 1.3% to the positive. Total company, 14% and 10.6%, and e-comm within that number is 10.2% reported and 10.4% ex gas and FX.  Our comp traffic and frequency for February was up 8% worldwide and 8.2% in the United States. Foreign currencies year-over-year relative to the dollar negatively impacted total and comp sales as follows: Canada by approximately 0.2%, Other International by approximately 4.5% and total company by approximately 0.7%. Gas price inflation positively impacted total reported comps by about 4% and average worldwide selling price per gallon was up year-over-year by 37%.  Worldwide, the average transaction for February was up 5.5%. Our U.S. regions with the strongest sales were Texas, the Southeast and the Northeast. Other international and local currencies saw the strongest results in Australia, Mexico and the U.K.  Moving to merchandise highlights for the month of February. Food and synergies was -- came in at a positive high single digits, fresh foods in the mid-single digits and nonfoods and deposit of high single digits. Ancillary businesses sales were up mid-40s and with gas being certainly a driver of that as well as food court and hearing aids were the top performers.  With that, I want to mention just a couple of recent executive changes. A month ago, we reported that Ron Vachris became President of Costco. Ron started his career 39 years ago at Price Company and Price Club at the young age of 17. Most of his career was in operations through 2015. Then he spent a little over a year in real estate traveling the world and working on both worldwide and domestic expansion. And since that time, in 2016 has been in merchandising with certainly responsibly, not only for in-line merchandising, but online merchandising as well as very involved with logistics and transportation.  As well, just this week, internally, we reported that taking Ron's previous spot is Head of Merchandising is Claudine Adamo. Claudine has been with us for 30 years. She began in an hourly position in our Kirkland warehouse in 1992, 30 years ago. But a year later, he came into buying and has been buying ever since and most recently was Senior VP of nonfood sales -- of nonfoods merchandising. And again, he'll be taking over -- looking overall of merchandising.  Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our March sales results for the 5 weeks ending April 3, on Sunday, April 3, on Wednesday, April 6 after the markets close.  With that, I will open it up to Q&A and turn it back to Jerome. Thank you very much. Well, certainly, I don't think you should interpret anything related to why or when. Historically, we always look at things like do we feel we can -- we look at ourselves in the mirror, do we feel that we've continued to increase the value of the membership. Certainly, we look at renewal rates we look less at what others do, frankly, but certainly is out there what others are doing. And what I do note is that I looked at the last three increases over the last 15 years, and on average, they were done about every 5.5 -- a little over every 5.5 years, about five years and seven months. And five years from the anniversary of the June of '17 would be this June. So I think the question will continue to be asked until we do or don't do something. But at the end of the day, we certainly feel very good about our member loyalty our success in getting members to move to executive member, which are the most loyal. And so you guys will know when we tell you, and at some point, it will happen, but stay tuned. Yes. Yes. Look, recognizing -- I'd like to think it was that easy that we could plan it and get there. Sometimes we get there, but 10 different variables go in 10 different directions than we had planned. There's lots of moving parts to it. The fact of the matter is we certainly have confidence in our competitive position and our confidence to get some margin as we go forth.  The fact of the matter is, our margins -- our gross margins are still even on core-on-core higher than they were two years ago. We had outsized margins two years ago, most particularly in fresh. When you had 20% and 30% increases in fresh, you darn near eliminated spoilage and \u2013 where are the 2s. Labor - you improved dramatically labor productivity in fresh. And you darn near eliminated all your spoilage. Some of that's not sustainable. So -- but even with some of the giveback, if you will, on a two-year stack, if you will, we've -- we're still showing higher year-over-year numbers on core-on-core.  The other thing is as we've said, and we don't sit around and just pound our chest on it. Despite these inflationary pressures, we've tried to hold where we can. Now needless to say you can't do that in near in its entirety. -- but we've probably been a little later than others in terms of raising some things in our view. We've worked with our suppliers to eat a little of it and we eat a little of it. And I think that these margins, particularly given the sales strength and the operating leverage, allow us to be ever more competitive and drive our business.  So when asked the question, as many of you know, over the years, who's our toughest competitor? It's us. And I don't really look at this as being a reflection of what's going on there. We're ever competitive. We're always checking our competition, and we feel that, that competitive - our competitive position is as strong as ever. Yes certainly, on the fresh and the fact that we're at higher sales levels, that allows for higher labor productivity and hopefully a little lower D&D or spoilage. I don't disagree with what you say, but there's -- never know what's going to happen tomorrow. I know that for 35 years, when things get better, we figure out how to give a little more of it back. And certainly, right now, with all the inflation, first and foremost, is getting merchandise on the shelves and then mitigating those various cost components as much as you can, which is not a lot. And again, but hopefully being as, if not a little more competitive than others. Well, we like when they feel more comfortable, frankly. Look, our most direct competitor is Sam's. We -- and I'm sure they do to do comp shops every week in every \u2013 darn near every location. We feel good about those gaps. It's not that they've widened or shrunk that overall, they're a tough competitor, and so are we.  As it rates to other traditional, yes, you've seen -- I think we've called out strength in gas business. I think overall, what I read externally about gross margins in retail gas by the supermarkets and others is up. And there's a little bit more -- that gives us breathing room as well. But we want to be ever more competitive. Not no, and we haven't. I think certainly, the more inflation creates some demand pressure. I'd like to think some of that inflation or wanting to shop across and save more frankly. But we haven't seen that. We haven't seen that. The only time in my recollection is a number of years ago, when prices got to $4, $5, Alan, and like then and now, we see our gallons improve relatively speaking because we're still the cheapest game. At some point, if it goes to 5 people stop driving a little bit, it's hard to state. I'd like to think that the hybrid models of working has helped a little bit there. It's interesting. On the one hand, the only thing I can think of is in fresh when there's been big fluctuations in prices or big increase in prices on beef relative to chicken or something, you'll see some trade down within the protein family. Other than that, a couple of anomalies that are perverse in the sense that it's almost just the opposite. We've seen strength in jewelry and in big-ticket furniture items and the like. And more conversions to executive membership, which, again, there's more value long term to that customer, but it's adding $60 to their fee. SP-7 Got it. Has not moderated. It continues to go up. Now it's going up perhaps at a little less so. The bigger slope was probably 4 to 2 months ago, and it's gone up from there. I think if I recall, there was a little low -- talking to the buyers a little low in the last couple of months of the year. But many suppliers are already talking back 2 months prior to that to come January, we'll be coming back and talking to you again. Well, at some point, we'll figure out what to do. And mind you, our Q2 balance sheet, Q 2 and balance sheet is probably the highest point from a seasonal standpoint because you've built a lot of sales and you still have some of the bills to pay from the Christmas time, not a lot, but some. And frankly, knock on wood, our operating cash flow has certainly exceeded what we had expected 2 years ago. So yes, there is a little more. At some point, certainly, one of the arrows in our quiver is a special dividend along with the regular dividend increase that we've done every year, as well as some stock buybacks.  But first and foremost is CapEx. CapEx this year of $4-ish plus million is up from the $3 million, $3.5 million over the last couple of years and up from numbers lower than that, the 2 to 4 years prior to that. So that's, first and foremost, what we want to spend money on. But we've done 4 specials and as one of the Board members said as we are a little quirky and it seems to have worked for us. So it's certainly an arrow in a quiver, but we haven't made any decision at this point. I think we -- that doesn't hurt, but at the -- honestly, at the end of the day, first and foremost, the factors that doesn't give us any concerns is the fact that our sales are strong. Our renewal rates and loyalty are at all-time highs. So that's all positive. And yes, when we do it, we use it to be even more competitive. So on the one hand, you might argue that because of inflation would this allow us to mitigate some of that. We're already doing that, by the way, without a fee increase. But we've done it 7 times in 35 years, and sometime between summer and 6 or 9 months down the road, is it likely? It's possible, but we'll have to wait and see. But we don't really consider what with Amazon or what we were asked the question the other way with some of our direct warehouse club competitors that theirs is -- they have not changed their in a number of years. And that does not concern us either. We look at what we're doing, how it affects our members -- and we look at ourselves in the Americas have we improved the value of the membership. And we've always felt that we've done that in a more dramatic fashion in these increases. And then we take those increases and use it to become even more competitive. So I cannot give you an answer other than we feel good about if and when we want to do it, we'll be able to Well, first of all, certainly in this quarter as well, the bottom line margin improvement was the sum of great expense improvement and some margin detriment, I'm taking out all the anomalies of each. And that's the way we want to do it. The old saying is we want to lower prices and raise margins. Same thing is we want to improve the bottom line while not raising prices. And I'm not talking about necessarily specific inflation right now. I think I recall a few of these -- of you on the call might remember this when we had our made first and last all hands all meeting out here with about 300 people.  And at the time, we had a 2.8% pretax return on sales, pretax. And our founder was up there saying that we're a great company and great companies deserve to make good money. And over the next several years, we wanted to go from 2.8 to a number. I won't get everybody excited, but a bigger number. And at the end of the day, it went up and down, but it has improved. I think that -- we got a lot of great things going on. We're not embarrassed to make money for our shareholders as well, but we're going to do it within the confines of being ever more competitive from a pricing and value standpoint to our members. It would be the all-inclusive yes. It's all of the above. I remember when we had particularly strong early in the Christmas holidays, Thanksgiving, Christmas holiday season. We had strength. Part of that was bringing in some things early. Part of it was this increased demand that COVID has created for goods for the home and the shortages of those same goods. And so once they hit the shelves, you sold quickly.  And then, of course, it was a little -- it was still positive, but a little less than that trend at the end of the calendar year. And without doing a lot of work, it seemed like that was the reason. Then you've got storms that affect the things. You've got shifts and things like Chinese and Lunar New Year. We really don't spend a lot of time doing that. We try to understand why overall something -- some level of sales either generally reduced increase, we don't worry about it as much. And -- but I don't think we spend a lot of time thinking about that. We're -- as we've been reminded from the day of our founding, we're a top line company and it's all about driving sales and value. And it's going to be as good as we can get it. And -- so we don't read a lot into what you asked. I would say we're more aggressive when things are good, and -- we're aggressive when things are good and bad. I remember somebody years ago asked the question, given that sales for whatever reason, had been weak for a month or 2. And that was more the reason to be even more strong on pricing. And I think actually had related to a pending membership fee increase based on this kind of 5-plus year anniversary. And the view was, no, our members are loyal and we're going to use it to drive more sales. So no, I don't -- I think we're still boarded that same DNA of trying to constantly drive more value and not worry about how strong or weak we are today, just keep driving more value and if we keep focusing on that, nobody can catch us. It's harder to catch us at least. Well, in theory, you don't get it back. If -- as I said earlier, if inflation is continuing, you should see some additional LIFO charges, maybe not as big, but who knows. And at some point, at the beginning, as you start a new fiscal year, you've had whatever LIFO charge you'll have for this past year. And those -- that's kind of the new set point for costs for each item.  And then to the extent if there's additional inflation relative to that starting point, you'll have some additional IPO next year. If things came down a little bit, let's say things -- I'm making these numbers up in the extreme. But things were up in 1 year, 20% and the next year, they were down 10%. You had a big LIFO charge this year, and you actually have some LIFO credit in the following year. On the Atlanta question, past history has indicated, yes, not in a big way, but the answer is yes, directionally. As it relates to if prices come down, if our costs come down, we want to be the first to lower the price, period. I think if you asked us two years ago, how would the next two years be in terms of new member sign-ups, we would be positive. But we probably have achieved greater than those expected -- than our own expectations, by a little. And so arguably that it was not just the stimulus, but notwithstanding the stimulus, there wasn't a lot of positive feelings out there in terms of the consumer and we did just fine.  So one of the good things that we've been blessed with that we are the extreme value proposition, and it generally bodes well for us in good and bad economic times. And so I think we don't pay a lot of attention to it other than really being focused on driving price and value of our products and services and taking care of the customer and then the rest seems to work. Well, we continue to raise them as others have, and we will continue to do that. The biggest single area of challenge is, one, we're headquartered in Seattle, which has become an increasingly expensive market. And within that, IT, where you not only have 3 big-hits, but the next 3 tech behemoths all have 10,000 to 20,000 employees in this town as well. So we've had to raise wages there and didn't happen overnight in the last 2 weeks. It's happened continually over the last couple of years.  And we will also lose a few people because we're not 100% work from home. We have a -- we think, a good fair hybrid work model. But for some -- a few, they want that. Overall, though, if you look at our total compensation and benefits package, 90% of our employees are hourly in the warehouse. And we -- while maybe there's a city or 2 where we've got to occasionally start it 1 step above the entry level, we've continued to raise the wages, as I mentioned in the thing and we'll do it again. Yes. Well, the biggest one is gas, and that's gone nothing but up. And again, as I mentioned earlier, the retail competitive price pressure is probably lessened over the last couple of years. TravelU mentioned is 1 that has been extreme ups and downs. There was a period during the mid-2020 year lockouts -- as COVID lockouts, where we had negative -- we had lost money in the business and had negative revenues because you're getting more cancellations and no new orders, and that fluctuate. It's come back. It fell a little bit with Delta. It came back after that. It fell a little bit with Omnicom, although now we seem to be upon the upward trend, and it is profitable, not as profitable as it was 2 years ago. but continue in that direction. Huge business and both vacation packages as well as auto renewal -- rental cars and the like.  So that's a business that's coming out nicely. It was businesses like where there's face-to-face touch, if you will, with -- in our hearing aid and optical shops. That was actually closed for a number of weeks in the mid-2020. But just for 10 or 15 weeks, I think, that's come back as well. Food courts have come back because we have shares in tables back out and we expanded the menu. So overall, a few of those ancillary business, they're not back to where they were, but they're getting there. And then, of course, the one business that dwarfs all the other is gas, just in its size and its increased profitability. So overall, ancillary is doing fine and some of the ones that were hurt the most are picking up. I don't have that detail in front of me. Margins are up, prices are up, and it's a huge business. It's a little more than 10% of our sales. It's a $20-plus million business now. Recognizing there's been, as I mentioned earlier, a 30-plus percent increase in just the price per gallon. But it's definitely been up the last couple of years and it's less volatile than it was 5 and 10 years ago in terms of a big margin fluctuation. But I don't have the detail like 2 years ago. Sure. I mean if you had asked me 5 years ago, how many -- 5 years hence or now how many -- what would it look like 5 years ago, we were opening about 25 a year, call it, 26 to make the math easy for a second. And maybe 70-30 U.S. and Canada, our most successful mature -- most mature markets. And then over the next 5 or 10 years, the 70-30 would probably go to 60-40 outside of the U.S. and Canada. And here we are 5 years into that incorrect answer, and we're pretty 65, 35 U.S. Canada for 2 reasons. Partly is our expectations of what we can do in the U.S. and Canada has increased, not just in the last 5 years, but in general, over many years; and it's taken a little longer the time lines internationally, although we've got more feet on the ground and more stuff looking.  So if you ask me today, I look 5 years from now, we'll go from 65-35 or whatever excess today, probably down to 50-50 I think the good news with that answer from that perspective is, is that we feel we still have plenty of opportunities in the U.S. and Canada, and we've ramped up our activities to do more in these other countries where we've also been quite successful.  The -- if you said -- asked over the next 10 years, we're opening, I think, this year, 16 of our 28 are in the U.S. I could be off by 1 or 2. Our view is there's no reason to think for the next 10 years, we can't open 15-or-so a year in the U.S. Now mind you, 1 or 2 of those are growing to 2 or 3 will be the business centers. We now have 22 business centers in the U.S. and 5 in Canada. That's been a good adjunct to our business. But we're also -- and we're infilling I gave an example at an internal meeting yesterday, and I've given it before to you guys.  In San Jose, about 4 or 5 years ago, we opened our fourth in the Greater San Jose market. At the time, the 3 units were doing about 250 each. Now the 4 units are averaging right at 300 each averaging. And on fewer members per location because you've got existing members driving less far, so there's a combination of infill. Now we're in 46 states, so there's not a lot of additional states. We're less penetrated versus our direct competitors in certain locations in the Midwest and Texas, South and parts of the Southeast, and we're still opening there as well. So it really is a combination of all those things. I think our view is the good news is that there's still -- we're far from saturating our most saturated markets. And we've upped the adding in terms of feet on the ground, the real estate feet on the ground, if you will, in terms of getting some more into the pipeline. Yes. A lot, I don't know exactly what we ask. I need to ask our membership marketing people. I think we've frankly been very pleased of our success of getting more existing -- more new members -- more existing members to convert and frankly, more new members to sign up initially as an executive. Mind you, 8 or 10 years ago, in the U.S. where it started, we've had it for 15 years now, probably. You came in and we just signed job, we asked you what you wanted. We didn't do a lot in maybe 20 or 25, at most 25 of every 100 signed up as an executive member. Today, it's in the 50s, closing in -- close to 60, and that's with just trying a little bit and showing them the value of it.  So I think we've done a better job of doing that. We do a better job when we go into a new country, we're now in I think 5 of our -- 6 of our countries, which are the largest ones. You want to have at least 15 or so locations before you're looking at it to put an executive membership on it. So we've toyed with the idea of having something even higher than the executive, but we always go back to the fact that what we have works very well. And so I don't think there's anything currently on our plate to change that.  We're always -- we've also asked the question, at some point, right now at 72% or 73% of our sales over the executive member, what happens when it gets to 85 or 90, do you eliminate the lower membership. At some point, we might, but that's, again, not in the cards at any time in the near future. We kind of like to what we're doing, it's working fine. I think it picks up, Stephen, in the next year or so. The first order of business, when we brought in people on that data analytics side 2 years ago, a person, he has built a great team. And we're seeing small deliverables, first and foremost, not online, but with the merchants and to a smaller extent, with some of the operators. And there's been some real deliverables that have saved our buyers' time and those are in the process of being rolled out.  On the personalization and targeting, I think we've got a little better targeting and that -- and still have a journey on the personalization, but that will be coming. But I thank you for asking it when you said a year or two. We'll take two more questions. Well, look, our goal for the last several years, there was the unique year of COVID where we went down to 13 openings because there were several that construction had stopped for several months in the middle of 2020. But the reality is, if you go back 5 or 6 years, we were opening 25-ish, some of the years 21 or 22-ish. And the view even then was to get up to closer to 30, certainly 25% to 30%. I think this year is we're finally hitting that with the expectation of 28 in my call this morning and call it, 26 to 30, whatever it comes out to be. And we would certainly be comfortable at 30.  One of the things that is unique is we try to be relatively methodical about it, particularly in new international markets. Once you open the first one, if it's successful, you're taking some people from that one, to help and succeed in opening the second one.  One of the things is it's the biggest cost factor on warehouse P&L is labor and efficiency. And when you're running a high-volume unit, it's helpful when you've got more people coming over from a nearby unit. So we are pretty methodical about growing somewhat slowly in new markets. We went from 1 to 5 20 years ago, over a 5-year period in Japan. We've sped up a little in China, thinking that we've opened 2 now in 3 years, and with another several in process and a couple more. So we've increased it a little bit. But we feel pretty good about that. So I would still say our rounded pat answer right now is 25% to 30%, and we'd like it to be more to 30 than 25 right now. But we're not necessarily looking at that percentage. As we get bigger, God willing and year 6 through 10, we're going to be talking about 30% to 35%, but we'll have to wait and see. Well, I think a couple of things we've got, not in a big way, but a couple of things we've done is there's probably a little bit more diversification of suppliers, particularly on huge $300 million to $1 billion SKUs. You need a little bit more there. We've brought in certain things -- nontraditional to its season during the winter bringing in bikes because we could have access to them, and we sold them. Yes, new countries of origin. So there's a few of those things, but not in a big way. Part of our success is huge buying power per item and having less than 4,000 SKUs to do our $200 billion is quite a bit different than having even 100,000 SKUs doing $150 billion to $500 billion, depending on who the retailer is. So we've made changes, and we are more open-minded to bringing in some things. But hopefully, this thing the supply chain works out over the next couple of years in a big way, in a better way. Yes. Well, it's like renewal rates. Renewal rates, irrespective of what it becomes 10 years hence in a location than in the market, it starts off at a lower number and builds up to the higher number. Same thing with that executive transition. We're doing better today and even in first year new markets. I think in the last couple of years, where we added executive Japan and Korea. And -- what? Yes, I mean that 42% number is hovering in the low 50s, 50 or a little higher in more mature markets. and starts off lower in other markets, but higher than it started in the previous new market a few years ago, so it grows over time. Well, thank you very much. Everyone, have a good afternoon and evening, and I appreciate you getting on the call."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by and welcome to the Q1 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Richard Galanti. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you, Anne, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the Company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal '22, the 12 weeks ended November 21st. Net income for the quarter came in at $1.324 billion or $2.98 per diluted share compared to $1.166 billion or $2.52 per diluted share last year. This year included a cash benefit of $91 million or $0.21 this year related to stock-based compensation and a write-off of certain IT assets of $118 million pre-tax or $0.20 per share. Last year include a tax benefits of $145 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, $0.16 of which was due to the deductibility of the $10 per share special cash dividend received by the company's 401(k) plan participants and $0.17 related to stock-based compensation as well an incremental expenses for COVID-19 premium wages of $212 million pre-tax, which was a hit last year in the quarter of $0.35 per share. Net sales for the quarter increased 16.7% to $49.42 billion, up from $42.35 billion a year earlier in the first quarter. Same-store sales for the first quarter were as follows: In the U.S., on a reported basis for the 12 weeks, up 14.9% and excluding gas inflation and the impacts of FX, up 9.9%. Canada reported 17.2% ex gas and FX plus 8.3%. Other international reported 13.4 ex gas and inflation in FX up 10.9% Total the company reported a 15% increase on a comp basis and 9.8% up ex gas and FX. And e-commerce which was reported at a 14.3 ex FX was 13.3. In terms of Q1 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 6.8% worldwide and at 5.9% in the U.S during the quarter. Our average transaction or ticket was up 7.7% worldwide and 8.5% in the U.S during the quarter. Excluding the positive impact from gas inflation and FX, the average ticket was up ex that plus 2.5% worldwide and plus 3.5% in the U.S. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S dollar positively impact sales by about 90 basis points and gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 430 basis points. Next on the income statement. Membership fee income reported in the quarter of $946 million, up $85 million or 9.9% from last year's $861 million figure. ex FX, the $85 million increase would have been 80 million, and the 9.9% increase would be 9.3%. In terms of renewal rates, our U.S and Canada rate came in at 91.6%, up three tenths of a percent from the 12 week earlier figure at Q4 end as well the worldwide rate came in at 89.0%, also up three tenths of a percent from 12 weeks ago at Q4 quarter end -- Q4 end. The renewal rates are continuing to benefit from more members auto renewing as well as increased penetration of executive members who on average renew at a higher rate than the non-executive members and first year renewal rates which have improved a lot. In terms of number of members at the end of first quarter, in terms of member households as well as total card holders, at Q1 end, total paid households was 52.5 million, up 800,000 from 61.7 a quarter ago, and total cardholders 113.1 million, up a $1.5 million from the 111.6 million 12 weeks ago. At Q1 end paid executive members totaled 26.5 million, an increase of 836,000 during the 12 weeks since Q4 end. The executive members represent 42% of our members and a little over 70% of our sales. Moving down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin for the first quarter was lower year over year by 49 basis points and excluding gas inflation lower year-over-year by 6 basis points. As I normally do, I ask you to jot down a few numbers. There are two columns both reported year-over-year in Q1 and then without gas inflation year-over-year in Q1. First line item would be core merchandise, minus 3x minus 63 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis and minus 26 basis points without gas inflation. Ancillary and other businesses plus two on a reported basis and plus 12x gas -- to gas inflation. 2% reward plus 3 and 1 basis point. LIFO minus three in both columns. Other plus 12 basis points in both columns. Total then are reported basis margins were down 49 basis points year-over-year and ex gas inflation down 6 basis points. In terms of the core merchandise component gross margin being lower by 63 year-over-year and 26 basis points ex gas inflation. Recall last year in Q1 the core reported was up 83 basis points and ex gas up 66 basis points. So we've retained a good portion of the improvement from 2 years ago in the core. In terms of the core margin on their own sales in the first quarter, our core and core margins were lower by 18 basis points, with non foods slightly up and food sundries. slightly lower year-over-year. Also lower year-over-year fresh foods was the primary driver of the core on core being lower in the quarter. Fresh continues to lap -- to lap exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outside sales that began the year -- that happened a year ago in the quarter. Ancillary another business gross margin was higher by 2 basis points on a reported basis and again plus 12 basis points ex gas inflation. Gas and travel were better year-over-year as they anniversary a softer quarter a year ago, offset by e-com, which was particularly strong a year ago and also related to the pandemic. LIFO, we had a 3 basis point or $14 million LIFO charge in the quarter. 2% reward higher by 3 on a reported basis and lower by one excluding gas inflation, a reflection of slightly higher sales penetration going to the increased number of executive members,. And other was up 12 basis points. This is related to COVID related costs from a year ago. That portion of the COVID related wages that go into the cost of sales like many of our manufacturing businesses and our bakery departments, given the inflationary pressures and our ongoing efforts to mitigate price increases to our members in the face of inflation as best we can, our Q1 gross margins results on all I think we're pretty good. Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the first quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 66 basis points and 29 basis points excluding gas inflation, again jotting down two columns of numbers. First column being reported and the second column being ex gas inflation. Operations was better or lower by 40 basis points and ex gas inflation better or lower by 11 basis points. Central reported better by 10. Without inflation, gas inflation better by 6, stock compensation better by 2 and worse by 1 in the two columns, and other better by 14 and better by 13 year-over-year. Total then again on a reported basis, our SG&A was better or lower by 66 basis points, and ex gas inflation lower or better by 29 basis points. The -- keep in mind, in terms of the core again better by 40 or better by 11 ex gas inflation. Keep in mind this result includes the permanent dollar and hour wage increase that began in March of 2021. And 4 weeks of additional starting wage increases that we just took this past October going from $16 to $17 and from $16 -- $15 to $18 for our two main categories of hourly employees. These latest changes in the starting wages went into effect October 25, just 6 weeks ago, and 4 weeks of those 6 weeks are included in Q1 - and Q1. Central, that's it no surprises there. Again, ex gas inflation basis better by 6. Stock comp as I mentioned a little better, a little worse by 1 ex gas inflation and other the 14 and the 13 basis points numbers. This consistent of the COVID expense of 150 million -- $159 million last year and the $180 million write off of the impacted IT assets that I mentioned earlier. Next on the income statement is preopening expense. This year in the quarter $28 million, last year in the quarter 22 or 6 million higher. All told, reporting operating income in the first quarter increased 18% coming in at $1.693 billion this year in the quarter compared to $1.43 billion last year. Below the operating income, line interest expense was $39 million each of the first quarters of fiscal '21 and '22. Interest income, interest expense rather, interest income and other for the quarter was higher by 13 million year-over-year, primarily due to favorable FX. Overall reported pre-tax income in the first quarter was up 19% coming in at $1.696 billion. This year compared in the first quarter last year of $1.42 billion. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the first quarter of '22 was 20.7% compared to 16.8% in Q1 last year. Again both years tax rates benefited from the tax treatment of stock-based compensation as mentioned earlier. $91 million this year and $75 million last year in the quarter. Additionally, last year's tax rate benefited from the tax deductibility of a special dividend, that portion payable to the company's 401(k) plan participants. For fiscal '22, effective tax rate excluding these discrete items is currently projected to be between 26% and 27%. A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, as you know, for fiscal '21, we opened 22 units including to reload. So a net increase of 20 units during fiscal '21. And this quarter that ended a couple of weeks ago, we opened nine units including one relo, So net openings of 8. For the remainder of the year, we plan to open 23 new units, and also -- print open 23 units, 4 of which would be relocations. So in that '19 if all goes as planned. It's been a busy past seven days. We opened our second Costco in France last Saturday on December 4, followed by our second building in China, which opened yesterday, as well as two buildings opening this morning -- opening today, one in the U.S in Florida and our fourth unit in Spain. Regarding CapEx, our first quarter fiscal '22 spend was approximately $1.05 billion. Our full year CapEx spend is estimated to be just about $4 billion. This would represent an increase of more than $400 million over last year's entire CapEx figure of $3.6 billion. The largest areas have increased coming from international spending for new warehouse expansion and increased investment in our logistics and e-com fulfillment operations. In terms of e-commerce, sales in the quarter ex FX increased 13.3% year-over-year. That's of course on top of the 86% plus increase a year ago in the first quarter. Stronger departments in terms of year over percentages include jewelry, tires and home furnishings. Our largest merchandise department in terms of sales majors, which is everything from consumer electronics and TVs to appliances, etcetera, was up in the high single digits also on a very strong sales increase a year earlier. In terms of an update on Costco logistics, it continues to drive our big and bulky sales. For the quarter, Costco logistics deliveries were up over 50% and now represent about 70% of our U.S e-com big and bulky shipments. Average -- with average during the quarter more than 50,000 stops per week. And for the year, we project more than $3 million stops, which would be anything from dropping something off to installing and taking away the old plans. For logistics in the full year, Our e-com mobile app. We continue to improve the site with additional features thus far as I've talked about the last few quarters of quarterly calls. We redesigned the app Header and Footer, we've updated and improved the menu layout. Our members now have the ability to view warehouse receipts online via both the app and desktop. Our co-brand Citi Visa card is now linked. It can now be linked to the digital membership card and can be used for payment. Our members are now able to much more easily reschedule e-com deliveries in the U.S and Canada. Same goes for rescheduling returns pickups and delivering in the first half of the new upcoming new calendar year. Labelling of fulfillment a better labeling of fulfillment methods. Members can -- it will be easily the -- will be able to easily see fulfillment options, be at e-com same day, and even nearby warehouse availability of a particular item at a particular item level. We're rolling out new e-com kiosks in the warehouse with video signage and easy touch screen ordering as well. We're rolling out e-commerce lockers. Currently in the U.S., we have 112 locations with more and --- we plan to more than double that number during calendar year 2022. In terms of e-commerce, there's a program that received some press yesterday just yesterday called Costco next, in a way it's like our warehouse road shows, but online, currently, there are 34 suppliers and growing, but it's still quite small, offering just under 1,000 items, curated items with Costco values, so please check it out when you have a chance. From a supply chain perspective, similar issues that we outlined in 12 weeks ago on the last quarter we call. Each issue ebbs and flows a little bit. But overall, the factors pressuring supply chains and inflation include port delays, container challenges, COVID disruptions, shortages of various components, raw materials, ingredients, and even packaging supplies, labor cost pressures and truck driver challenges. Overall, we feel we've dealt pretty well with the supply chain challenges in terms of delayed container arrivals on the Pacific Coast. About 79% of our import containers are late by an average of 51 days. A few percentage of those were actually a few days early and many of them are a few days more than 51 late. Virtually all departments are impacted. We've ordered early in many cases as I mentioned, I think in earlier calls, given the lower longer lead times, less product and packaging challenges, but still quite a bit. Still some limitations on key items, but improving again, it ebbs and flows. Chip shortage is still impacting many items, some more than others. In some instances, delayed inventory simply extends the season, an example might be lawn and garden and patio. As soon as the product arrives, it sells pretty quickly. But it may extend into beyond the normal seasonal time, toys and seasonal in fact, same thing, some inventory, in fact, won't make it before Christmas, but we've mitigated that as best as possible, and feel pretty good about it. And in terms of moving on to -- despite all the supply chain issues, again, we're pretty -- feel pretty good about staying in stock and continuing to work to mitigate cost and price increases as best we can. Moving on to inflation. Again, it's pretty much the same story that we told during each of the last two quarters. There have been there have been in our variety of inflationary pressures that we and others are seeing, from labor costs to freight costs to higher demand to container shortages and port delays to increase demand on certain product categories. Much of what you see and read out there are very shortages on everything from chips to oils and chemical supply by facilities hit by the Gulf store was a while back, higher commodity prices. For Q1 '22, and talking with our merchants and merchants, we estimate that overall year-over-year price inflation to be in the 4.5% to 5% range. That's a little bit higher of an estimated inflation rate that I discussed a quarter ago. But I think pretty consistent with what you read out there. All the said, much kudos to the job that our merchants and our traffic department and our operators have all been able to do in order to get the products that we need to pivot when and where necessary and keep our warehouses full. While keeping prices low for our members and continuing to show value versus our competitors. Look I think overall this is reflect this is best reflected in the operating results that we continue to achieve despite these many challenges. Anecdotally on merchandising, holiday stuff has been strong, again, sometimes it depends on when the merchandise gets in. Baking items more people seem to be getting together a strong -- gift cards are up, dramatically from a year ago, but it was weak a year ago. Pet products as you might expect are strong with the benefit of increasing pet population over the past couple of years. Alcohol [ph] and spirits are strong, including gift boxes of various items. And, of course continued strength in consumer electronics, appliances, furniture and mattresses and the like. Apparel actually has enjoyed much stronger sales growth this year,. albeit compared to a relatively flat apparel sales a year ago. One last comment. Our sustainability commitment website received a major refresh this week. So please feel free to visit the site. It's linked directly from our homepage under the column about us and then click on sustainability commitment. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our December sales results for the 5 weeks ending Sunday January 2, on Wednesday, January 5 after market close. With that I will open it up to questions and turn it back over to Sadie. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] For our first question we have Michael Lasser from UBS. Michael, your line is open.\nMichael Lasser: Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question, which are your point about 4% to 5% in inflationary increase across the assortment. Typically Costco has been slower to raise prices than everyone else that seems to be a number that's in line with others across the retail sector. So is the -- is it the posture changed with respect to passing along price increases? Why is that the case? And if Costco have more pricing power today than it ever has in the past, given the pricing gaps between you and others in the market?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think as it relates to a passing on, we've always said we want to be the last to raise the price in the -- first to lower the price, recognizing there's a limit to what you can do based on these cost increases. First and foremost, I think because of our relative purchasing power and our relationships with our vendors, we with our suppliers work to mitigate those increases in any way shape or form we can, Ultimately that may include us taking a little more less markup and maybe then taking a less markup. There's no complete, consistent answer throughout as you might expect. But overall, I think we've done a relatively good job of that and there is inflation in those numbers, those numbers are kind of a combination of our cost increases as well as our some price increases and, again, it fluctuate there. For every few examples of something going up, there may be an example of something flatter, going down a little bit for unrelated reasons. And so again, it's a best guess, it's fluid. We saw inflation starting several months ago in a bigger way, I think, in our fiscal Q4 this summer, and continuing into this fiscal year and as we all have read articles, general articles out there about certain different major consumer product manufacturers announcing increases and continue to do so. So I think it's going to continue, hopefully, we're getting towards the top and it'll start flattening out and subsiding. But we'll see.\nMichael Lasser: My follow-up question is with the core merchandise margin ex fuel and core on core gross margin getting less bad or declining at a lesser rate, this quarter than last. Is this a sign that the margin here is stabilizing? And do you think the Costco exits the pandemic with a structurally higher gross margin than it had in the past, or all these dynamics simply a function of what you've often said, which is when overall retail margins go up, go to Costco for just a little less than others. Thank you.\nRichard Galanti: So I think I'm the last comment, yes, in terms of that last comment you made. Look, I think, at the end of the day, I think we -- in many ways have benefited from market share gains. Hopefully some or most of which will be sticky. The biggest thing that impacts margins many often is not only on the buying power side, and arguably, I can't think of any company that has the buying power per item that we do, because we do roughly $200 billion in sales with 4,000 ish items versus anybody else that's doing it with hundreds of thousands of items, or 50,000 items. But I think that having higher levels of sales productivity, particularly in things like fresh foods, helps your margin. We'll keep some of that and we'll use it to be even more competitive and hopefully, build a bigger model a little bit. But I think that some of it is probably structurally there. But as some famous TV actress said, once it's always thought is always going to be something. And, we'll keep fighting that battle out there. But we feel pretty good about some of the structural things that have occurred that hopefully will help us in the future. But we'll have to wait and see.\nMichael Lasser: Great. Thank you very much and have a good holiday. Thank you.\nOperator: For our next question, we have Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Simeon, your line is open.\nSimeon Gutman: Hey, everyone. I'll be Simeon for this call. My first question is actually a follow-up to Michael's second question. Maybe I'll ask it a different way, Richard. The 2-year core on core looks like it's actually getting better. And you said it yourself, you thought you did a pretty good job on it, and it looks like you are. So if we're kind of getting it feels like you're managing through the worst of it. And the environment may be getting better at the margin. I don't want to go too far. And say that, why shouldn't be this be the worst for the core on core notwithstanding comparisons, but the minute they get harder, but then they start to get easier.\nRichard Galanti: Yes, look, I think that's hopefully how the storybook goes. It's always going to be something but no, look, we Jokes aside, we feel pretty good about structurally what we've been able to accomplish. And part of that is market share with higher sales levels. And we've not stopped the -- what I'll call the buyer creativity of working with suppliers to figure out how to continue to drive greater value. I can think of 50 examples, but at the end of the day, we're continuing to drive value in lots of ways and whether it's changing packaging, or using our volume, moving certain production to different parts of the world. And to take -- to again to make that moat even a little bigger. So I agree with you that so far, the story that you suggested is playing out, and hopefully it'll continue to play out.\nSimeon Gutman: Fair enough. My second question is more on SG&A and the business's leverage point. We used to chat about, Costco, always doing mid single digit comps and that's good enough to cover the SG&A dollar growth. I think this quarter, the business did about 6.5% dollar growth adjusted. And you're going to have some of these wage investments that don't annualize Well, maybe not to the middle or to closer to the end of the year. So I'm trying to get at what a normal post COVID SG&A rate may look like. And then, does that mean it's sort of that mid single-digit comp rate that leverages those expenses, I think is related to the probably the best estimate and I say guesstimate not estimate on where do you start? Where's the inflection point of leveraging SG&A probably still is in that mid single-digit range. Beyond that, who the heck knows. I mean, we've been able notwithstanding some of these increases. We've been a, particularly in wages, we've been able to in strong comps have helped help these numbers. But I think we feel pretty good about having the sales volumes that continue to be able to leverage those expenses. So as soon as we find out, we'll let you know. But again, we're feeling pretty good about things at this juncture. And at some point, I would assume comps have to come back to hopefully better than pure average, but something back to where they had been pre-COVID, but on a higher base, and even that helps you a little bit.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay, great. Thanks. Happy holidays, everyone.\nRichard Galanti: You too.\nOperator: For the next question, we have Christopher Horvers from JP Morgan. Christopher, your line is open.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good evening, everybody. So, I wanted to ask a little bit about your thoughts on holiday pull forward. Obviously, you saw an acceleration in trend on a 2-year basis in October, and then November things obviously, still amazing comp and gaining share. But trends decelerated and it was sort of against what was a weaker, I think, end of the month last year. So, can you talk about, like, what do you think is driving that? How do you think about the rest of the holiday season? And as you think about a consumer that's going to lap a bunch of stimulus in the first half of next year, what are your initial thoughts on how that all could play out?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think, again, as you just mentioned, November's comps were a shade under outside expectations, still very good, a couple percentage points different than what we had been enjoying the couple of months prior that. Probably the view is a little bit of that was pulling forward. But even within last month's number, the weeks varied, and overall, we're good. But just when it comes -- when it is reduced a little the next day, it's better than you expected. So I think the one thing that I feel good about is, is our in-stocks. Our senior merchant the other day had indicated in his view is that, his feeling is that we're better and stocked than anybody out there. And I think part of that is the fact of limited selection, that we are an item business, we could put something else in place or something. But we've done a pretty good job. I mean, I had a -- with a little bit of a chuckle at a call just yesterday from a reporter asking about how are we doing on cream cheese. And so I checked and [indiscernible] cream cheese shortage out there and the bagel shops are being challenged. We actually got it as the buyer said, it took a little extra work, but we've got all the cream cheese we need. So I think we've done a good job in merchandising.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And so, I guess as you think about last year, and the stimulus I mean, do you think that -- I mean actually I think the consumer, as you get closer to Christmas and New Year's, probably comes back if people are entertaining more, like you said in the baking side. But as you get into January and stimulus and stimulus in the spring, do you think your business lifted off a stimulus last year?\nBob Nelson: It couldn't hurt, it probably helped a little bit. I know historically when there's been some stimulus items out there factors, our view is that we have not been impacted as much as other, but directionally we've been impacted the same. Look, if next year, there's a reduction in stimulus, lord knows what's going to happen with the stock market in general and how people feel about where they -- how they feel financially. That may change a little bit. But I feel -- we feel pretty good around here, that one of the things that we've shown over the years that both in good and bad times, we tend to do well, and good times, because people want to spend more and even in less good times people want to save more. And so I think from a merchandising stem and in tougher times, there's additional products and services that might be willing to sell us for the first time. So in our own perverse way, we sometimes benefit from good and bad and right now we're feeling pretty good about what the future looks like.\nRichard Galanti: Oh, by the way, the other thing that Bob just mentioned, that even if certain things head south in some way, shape or form like reduction or lack or elimination of certain stimulus items, supply chain at some point is going to get better. As good as our members are, we could do better if we had more supply of certain of those items. Even in some categories in non-food that are up 20% and 30% plus, the buyers view, we're still running out of stuff, or to do better if we had more. And that's not just us, I mean that's -- it's rains on everybody. But I think some improvement in supply chain will be an offset any other things that are detrimental to that thought.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. Thanks very much and enjoy the run on cream cheese at the clubs this weekend. Take care.\nBob Nelson: Historic.\nOperator: For our next question, we have Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Chuck, your line is open.\nCharles Grom: Hey, Richard and Bob team. Hope you guys are doing well, Question on leverage. If we back up the one-time charges in the quarter, it looks like you enjoyed over 100 basis points of improvement year-over-year and 65 basis points last quarter. And fully realizing the comps on a stock basis were better, but wondering if some investments or other costs may have rolled off. Just some thoughts on that front.\nRichard Galanti: I think more of it is just the leverage of sales growth, frankly. Again, taking out the specific COVID related charges that we talked about, and factors we didn't talk about in terms of separating in the press release was that dollar an hour increase we did in March, and the new one that had a small impact in Q1 because it started 6 weeks ago. But in that regard, there's nothing that stands out in my view. And my guess estimate, I'm looking at my guys here, do you -- it was strong -- strong sales would be the number one factor.\nCharles Grom: Okay. Okay, fair enough. And then just on the storefront, 14 opened thus far in '22. So you're more than halfway to the goal, which is great. I was just wondering bigger picture, has there been any more discussions to backfill some of your existing markets, your higher density areas where perhaps some stores, just can't handle any more productivity more -- any more throughput just because of the volumes?\nRichard Galanti: I think that's -- the answer is yes. And I think that'll be small methodical increases in that thought over the next several years. I mean, it used to be that we talked about when we had 400 warehouses and the average, I'm making those numbers up. So the average was 180. And now the I think we have an average several years later in the high 200s in the U.S at least. And we have a number of units in the 300 to 400 range. I mean, not the hundreds, but 10s of. And so we're looking for more infill. That we've been doing that and if it was 3 to 5 a year, or 3 to 7 a year, in the last 5 years, is it going to be 5 day a year. Could be I don't have that kind of detail in front of me.\nCharles Grom: Okay, great. And then my last one is just a follow-up on Chris's on November. I believe you guys did call out that there was some moderation in retail inflation, maybe 150 basis points or so. I\u2019m just wondering if you could provide any color on where that retail inflation came in. And I guess why that happened? Was it self inflicted, just wanted to get some color there.\nRichard Galanti: One thing that was a little lower was from the increases in food and sundries and some food sundries items in fresh. That had spiked even more, it's still up year-over-year, but it spiked a little, it came down a little bit from where it had been. And then we haven't quantified anything specific beyond that.\nCharles Grom: Okay. All right.\nBob Nelson: And as you might expect, they're their suppliers out there. They're saying hey, come January, February, you'll see some more increases. And, again, this is not consistent with what you -- what I've read in general articles in the various business periodicals.\nCharles Grom: Okay. So just a lot of timing differences. Okay.\nRichard Galanti: Yes.\nCharles Grom: Great. Thanks. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: For the next question, we have John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. John, your line is open.\nJohn Heinbockel: So, Richard, how is KS [ph] performing and what happens or how do you think about it in an inflationary environment, in terms of how you take price versus like items on the national brand side. And this KS do better in an inflationary environment?\nRichard Galanti: Look, many of our KS items are of such large volumes. It's not unlike dealing with the comparable large volumes we do in a branded CPG item. And so we're out there, fighting with both of them to try to mitigate those cost increases. KS still grows at a little faster rate than others, but nothing discernible. I think we keep finding new items to do KS with and for a variety of different reasons. And so it continues to drive that brand. But no, I don't think there's a -- we don't see a big difference of how that's changing.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay. Secondly, you're talking the 70% on Costco Logistics is 70% of your needs. You're at what capacity in logistics? Is it still 50%? Or is it crept above that?\nRichard Galanti: It's in the 50% range. Maybe it's slightly higher than that, based on our when we originally bought what's now Costco Logistics, a year and a half ago. We moved over a bunch of volume, we've grown it as well, grown our total base of need. And I think we're slightly above the 50% that we felt we had capacity for at the time. And we certainly have plenty of capacity over the next few years. Mind you, we're spending money on it. Part of our fulfillment and logistics as I think I mentioned on the last quarterly call, within CapEx we had spended $340 million or so on a multi acre million, 1.6 million square foot distribution facility in Southern California. That's for a variety of needs. Some of the -- much of what we bought Innovel acquisition in March or April of 2020, more than 10 million square feet of space around the country, much of its leased. Much of its fine, by the way, but we're not all that was geographically, particularly the big sites, 2 billion square foot sites were an area is where we're stronger relative to where Sears is stronger, or they had most of their business at the time. So we're still spending money on it and upgrading it. But we\u2019re -- again, from a merchandising standpoint, we're very excited about it. And it's helped us grow that business in a big way. And given our small market share of many of those items, particularly on the plant side, we feel there's a lot of growth potential for us.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: For the next question, we have Karen Short from Barclays. Karen, your line is open.\nKaren Short: Hey, thanks very much. I wanted to just talk about ticket a little bit. So U.S ticket at 3.5%? Can you kind of parse that out on per transaction versus AUP, but also tie that into the inflation numbers that you called out for the quarter and/or your expectations on inflation?\nRichard Galanti: Honestly, I can't. I don't have that detail in front of me. Generally speaking, you've got electronics that like TVs and what have you that are going down in price, maybe a little less this year, because there's less promotions because of shortages. I mean, in every budget meeting every 4 weeks were presented examples of items where we're taking down the price of high volume key items by changing the packaging by moving some aspect of manufacturing to another part of the world. And so I don't have the detail here in front of me for that. Sorry.\nKaren Short: Okay. And then I wanted to -- I don't think this has been asked for a while. But can you give an update maybe on what the average ticket is for executive members versus gold? And then, I know you gave, obviously, you've given the percent of sales, but frequency of executive versus gold, how maybe that's changed over the last, almost 2 years of the pandemic?\nRichard Galanti: I will -- somebody is just running out of the room to see if they can grab that sheet. And I'll answer it as soon as they get back if you want to ask another question or move on to the next one. But I'll [indiscernible] gets back.\nKaren Short: Well, my standard question would be just on your cash balance in terms of thoughts on special dividends?\nRichard Galanti: Oh, well, as soon as we know you'll know or the day after. The -- look our cash position is strong. One of the things I pointed out is our CapEx is also increasing in a conscious way, notwithstanding that our cash flow from operations is growing at a quite a stronger rate as well. It's something that we've done 4x in 8 years. We and the shareholders seem to like it when we do it, and so I'm not trying to be cute, but we haven't made that decision at this juncture. It's probably a win not if, but when it'll be -- when we do it.\nKaren Short: Okay. And then maybe just while you're waiting for that numbers on the executive, can you just maybe give us some color on what percent of freight is actually spot versus contract? I don't know if you've ever given that number.\nRichard Galanti: I don't have the exact number, but I'm willing to bet, it's 80% plus. I could be wrong, a little bit, but it contracted. Now recognizing with contracts, we might do 1, 2 and 3 year contracts. So we're still benefiting on 3-year stuff. And then if any little on 2-year stuff, and now gone beyond the benefit of the 1-year stuff, And so it's over two or three year period, but our assumption is, is it'll take less than that time to start to normalize somewhat.\nKaren Short: Okay, great.\nRichard Galanti: Is it happen today [indiscernible], yes.\nKaren Short: Right.\nRichard Galanti: But it's -- I think we again, we probably with other large users of freight and containers, have probably done a pretty good job of at least staggering, that not having to do a lot of spot stuff so far.\nKaren Short: Great. Yes. I mean, if you got those numbers on executive and golden ticket and frequency, that'd be great.\nRichard Galanti: Okay. What they came back with right now is we don't have -- I don't have quickly average ticket changes. But the total spend per executive member compared to a Gold star member is almost 3x.\nKaren Short: Okay. Thank you.\nRichard Galanti: Call it 2.5. Thank you.\nKaren Short: Okay. Thanks so much. Bye.\nOperator: For our next question, we have Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Greg, your line is open.\nGreg Melich: Hi, thanks. I\u2019ve two questions, Richard. One is digging a little bit into the margins, the gross margins. You said gas and travel have helped, but then offset by e-commerce. Can you sort of explain where -- so that was gas penny profit was up even at the mixer. Is that \u2026\nBob Nelson: Margin percent was down but you got a 40%. 50% increase in price per gallon.\nGreg Melich: Got it.\nRichard Galanti: So you still might have more pennies per gallon, but the margin itself was down.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And then that was offset by e-commerce.\nRichard Galanti: [Indiscernible] e-commerce. Yes, and again, I would read a lot into any of that description. We're just trying to share with everyone directionally what helps it and hurts a little bit. e-commerce just given all the activity, we've gotten expenditures on fulfillment and expansion, and doing what we can over time when we're pulling tickets if we -- if something else happened. I don't view as a big issue from it. It's not whatever -- whether the margins up a little down a little, it's less about competition and more about what's the product mix that month or week. And what else is going on with this rapid expansion and investment in it?\nGreg Melich: Got it. And then maybe that's a tie back your discussion on the logistics. Big and bulky, if we look at the e-commerce is roughly 8% of sales, its big and bulky a quarter of that. Is that the kind of scale we're talking about?\nRichard Galanti: It's over a third. So we\u2019re third, great.\nGreg Melich: And then last but not least, the renewal rates continuing to tick up I guess, impressive how do we -- what -- it shouldn't have come off at some point. Just given that you have more first year members?\nBob Nelson: [Indiscernible] get to 100? No, just kidding. Look, I think as I mentioned earlier in this and when I speaking, probably the single biggest thing that's helping it right now is, auto renew. As we get more people on a credit card both in the two big co-branded in U.S and Canada. That's a no brainer to help a little bit as we convert people to executive member. And as we, for every 100 new people signing up a slightly higher number of them sign up as executive members, they are more likely to renew. So those things help as well. The thing I mentioned about new warehouses and markets around the world tend to be while they have a very much lower renewal rate in their first year of renewal or a year or two, and then now continue to grow as more people have renewed the prior year. Those are starting -- generally those are starting at higher rates than they were. So all those things help a little bit. I'd like to think it's all the wonderful things we do and the value proposition and but certainly auto renew is probably a good help there.\nGreg Melich: And then last, because someone has to ask it just fee increase, I guess, back half next year is when we'll be 5 years since the last one. What are the thoughts on that? Just given that the members seem to be self selecting the fee hike already through the executive membership? Does that change your thought process as to when you might hike the fee? And our only thought is, is we are probably start getting questions about now. So when we [indiscernible] still a while away, and we certainly feel good, as I've said, in the past, renewal rates, strong renewal rates and loyalty help that process -- so that thought process and we'll see. But it's just a little bit of time to think about it.\nGreg Melich: Very well have a great holiday season, everyone.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you.\nOperator: For our next question, we have Rupesh Betti from Oppenheimer. Rupesh, your line is open.\nRupesh Betti: Good evening, thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to touch on Canada and other international. So we saw a strong and accelerating 2-year contract for both Canada and other international. Is there any more color you can provide in terms of maybe what you're seeing in those geographies?\nBob Nelson: I'm getting a little help here. It's more -- it's probably most is roguery, it's probably most about what how COVID impacted different countries differently. timing wise. I remember a year ago, a year and a half ago, some of the foreign countries did better while we were being locked down, and then later, they got locked down. And so part of it is one of the reasons I think everybody is picked up on the 2-year stack concept. But I think that's as much as anything that that's the reason.\nRupesh Betti: Okay, great. And then as you look at your ancillary businesses, is there a way you can find an update as to how they're trending now versus pre-pandemic?\nRichard Galanti: I don't have that detail with me. But generally speaking, tires have picked up as an example of an ancillary business. But the Costco auto program is down because there's a shortage of cars out there. Travel is up not where it was pre it was almost back to where it was pre-COVID. And then delta variant hit. And then it was coming back again and then Omicron hit. So it fluctuates pretty quickly. Omicron though, and I'm trying to think the other things. Food courts have come back. Not I don't think they're quite where they were, but they're almost there. Hearing aids have come back. But still, I think slightly below pre-pandemic. Articles doing great. Pharmacy is doing great, helped, frankly, by the shots. We like other retail pharmacies, providing plenty of vaccines.\nRupesh Betti: Okay, great. Thank you for all the color.\nRichard Galanti: Okay.\nOperator: For our next question, we have Stephanie Wissink from Jefferies. Stephanie, your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good afternoon. This is Blake on for Steph. First question will be higher level, you guys are a big proponent of the in-store shopping experience. It seems like store sales have been fairly strong as of late for retailers. So wondering, how have your -- how's your in-ore shopping compared versus e-com versus your expectations recently? And then maybe if you can share any e-com pilots you might have that you've been working on? I know you mentioned you did a pickup test, but you discontinue that. Anything maybe in the works that you can share.\nRichard Galanti: Well, both in-store and online have picked up. The pickup from things like Instacart for same day fresh skyrocketed during the lock downs in mid to summer, mid to late summer 2020 came down from those peaks, but it's still way above where it was pre-COVID. E-commerce is as you know, because we talk about every quarter is 8% or 9% of our sales on that company. There's $192 billion in sales for the year ended this last August. So that's a lot bigger than it was. 2 years ago, well I think in the last 3 or 4 quarters, the 2 year taxes 100% plus. But notwithstanding that, and part of that is the big and bulky that has helped that number, which we really weren't driving that kind of business in-store anyway. The fact that I think that as we've heard occasionally that notwithstanding some people don't like our mask requirements when we first put them in back in May of 2020, I think overall people felt if I've got to go out I'm going to go out to one place and [indiscernible] stuff. And with taller ceilings and wider aisles and all those things, I got to believe that psychologically that's helped a little bit. At the end of the day, we were all surprised by [indiscernible] March of 2020, we're surprised by the strength in non-foods categories, summer and fall of 2020, much less now -- much the same now. It was because people weren't travelling, and they weren't going to games and concerts, but they were buying things for their home. And we certainly had on top of all the food items, all the other things they could buy for their home. So that was a pleasant surprise to us and that's continued. In terms of other tests, not a whole lot. I mean, we did have that small test in New Mexico with buy online and pick up in store. [Indiscernible] as I mentioned on the call, we have over -- a year from now have over 200 of our U.S warehouses with lockers. In terms of buying online, pick up in store, we're not quite sure about that. We have very busy locations, there's not a lot of room for it. And it doesn't seem to be a lot of people clamoring [indiscernible] or half the people that come in and do that on a few things that we buy online and the lockers, they come in and shop while they're there. And so that's what we want. So beyond that, I don't think -- I think some of the things we're doing that I mentioned briefly about mobile and digital, some of these things everybody else have, we are sometimes late to the game on some of these things. But those are -- should be on that additive to what we do.\nUnidentified Analyst: That's super helpful. I was also wondering on your inventory positioning. How much are you getting ahead of, any seasonal items, or any challenges you may foresee for Q2 and Q3 for the spring and summer?\nRichard Galanti: I don't know exactly. I know that consciously they -- the buyers when they presented the budget meetings or talking about those issues, we are bringing in things early. We certainly have -- you think about it, what we call our depot, our view of distribution system in the U.S was something like 10 million square feet. And we essentially slightly more than double that with the Innovel acquisition, aside from other things that helps us with a little storage if we needed or bringing in things early. Recognizing we start with we are somewhat seasonal, but historically volleys brought things in early anyway. So we've -- whatever it may be, we certainly have the cash, as somebody mentioned earlier, to have some extra billion dollars invested in inventory, even if it hangs around for a little bit. But I think overall, some of our items are still a little later than they would be pre-COVID. But better than they would be if we were not doing as good a job as I think we are doing on forward buying.\nUnidentified Analyst: Perfect. If I could sneak one last one in. I might have missed it, but I think you said for the net new openings this year, you said 19. I thought the last quarter you were aiming more towards 25. Is there anything to call out?\nRichard Galanti: When I said it was 19 more in the last three quarters of the year, fiscal year, plus the [indiscernible].\nUnidentified Analyst: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator: For our next question, we have Paul Lejuez from Citi. Paul, your line is open.\nBrandon Cheatham: Hey, everyone, this is Brandon Cheatham for Paul. I was wondering if we could talk about the increase in CapEx. I think last we spoke we thought CapEx would have a [indiscernible] front of it. Now it sounds like it's -- it has a four in front of it. I'm just wondering, is there a change in the strategy there? And specifically on the e-com investments, do you feel like you're playing some catch up there or laying the groundwork for growth, just anything that you can share with that?\nRichard Galanti: Sure. I think previous as relates to this year, we had talked about, I think 3.8 to 4.2 quote unquote, now we're saying about four. These numbers are up from the mid threes over the last couple of year, low to mid threes over the last couple of years. In fact, last year's 3.6 included a $340 million or $345 million asset purchase that I mentioned earlier in the Southwest, in Southern California, which is basically a 1.5 million plus square foot facility with lots of acreage to help with our fulfillment as well as our import stuff. And so I think there's, if you said what are the big things take you from the low threes to the low fours over a few years a period, it's more international expansions, which tends to be a little more expensive for location, more expansion, we -- in fiscal '20, we were down to 13 net new units because some delays with COVID. I think we were 20 and 21 and we're going to be 27 net new units this fiscal year. plus five relos, which is -- six relos planned. We might miss that a little bit. But at the end of the day, so there's more warehouses. Clearly more in the whole fulfillment concept, starting with the $1 billion acquisition a year ago of what's now Costco Logistics, starting with adding additional square footage to that, as well as the international things. And even on the distribution side, or what we call our cross stock depots, spending money overseas now in some of these countries to do some of that in a better way. Actually building a mini depot in Hawaii, where we have five locations? Seven, I'm sorry. Seven locations, but huge volume locations. And with a -- so we\u2019ve gotten to the volume and efficiency there that these are good investments. So it's a lot of those things. Mind you, we still spend all in close to a $1 billion a year here in IT.\nBrandon Cheatham: Got it. And it's how we should kind of think about it going forward long-term?\nRichard Galanti: That's -- by the way, that's not all CapEx, that's expenses, go ahead I'm sorry.\nBrandon Cheatham: And the 4 billion range is what we should think about CapEx for the long-term.\nRichard Galanti: I don't know for the long-term, I think four sounds about right for the next year or two. And if things continue to grow well -- go well and grow well, maybe goes up from there a little bit. But we're not looking to spend it if we don't think we have good things to spend it on just because our cash flow has been exceeding net income plus -- our cash flow has been exceeding regular dividend plus capital expenditures, and the like.\nBrandon Cheatham: Got it. And you also mentioned that you're able to change our products, when you're faced with shortages. I was wondering if you could quantify that versus kind of a normal quarter. And if you are switching out more than usual, what impact does that have on consumer behavior there, anything on the logistic side as well?\nRichard Galanti: I think it's -- I don't have the exact number, but my guess is it's a small low to mid single-digit percentage. What it means though is when back -- going back all the way back to spring of 2020 and there were -- people were hoarding goods. We were going out to additional suppliers to see what we can get recognizing from their perspective, it creates a new relationships, which will honor. You only forward not just for the three months that we [indiscernible]. And so I think there were opportunities to just expand product brands by necessity into some things, and with I think the -- going into last summer and fall with that advent of all the things for the home, both patio furniture and [indiscernible] and barbecue grills and indoor furniture and electronics and gadgets for the kitchen, we took advantage of that and brought in additional items. And so it's more of that than anything. And the treasure hunt, yes. So it's still a small piece, but I think it's -- when I sometimes -- when I go into some retailers, I'm not going to go into any names, but you'll see a shelf half empty or some spaces. First of all, once you put something in there and but at the end of the day, I think our buyers have done a very good job of keeping the warehouses full.\nBrandon Cheatham: Okay. Thanks, and good luck for holiday.\nOperator: For our next question, we have Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. Edward, your line is open.\nEdward Kelly: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Happy holidays. Richard, I wanted to ask you gross margin [technical difficulty] considered. Any additional thoughts that you can share current quarter [technical difficulty] reason we should expect some incremental [technical difficulty] somewhat similar.\nRichard Galanti: You're breaking up entirely during that call. So I heard about every other word, if you want to repeat yourself.\nEdward Kelly: Yes, sorry. So I wanted to ask you about the gross margin. As you said, pretty good all things considered, any additional thoughts you can share on the current quarter? Comparisons in the core looks similar I think. Just wondering if there's any reason we should expect any incremental pressure.\nRichard Galanti: From a competitive standpoint, I mean, there's lots of -- everybody is competitive. Again, I think structurally our model allows us to [indiscernible] that. We talked about more pennies per gallon of profit that allows us to do some other things. I think we've got a -- I think we have a lot of levers to pull here. And we feel pretty good that we are able to hold the prices on key items. And to -- I don't really think that we consider the challenge of achieving a margin. We're pretty good at figuring out how to get there, while still being the company we are in terms of competitiveness. So no big changes of what we see out there.\nEdward Kelly: Okay.\nRichard Galanti: Just there's a lot of changes every month, and some things go up and some things go down. But overall, we feel pretty good about it.\nEdward Kelly: All right. And then just [indiscernible] for a little bit more big picture just around customer data. I was hoping maybe you could just provide an update on things like personalization. And then media is something that we hear a lot of people talk about, maybe just any thoughts on what you're doing with that opportunity as well.\nRichard Galanti: I think there's still low hanging fruit on the tree here. We've talked about it a little bit, we've done a little bit more targeting than we have ever done, but very little, there is more to come. It was just a year and a half ago, that we hired someone at a relatively senior level in terms of data analytics. But that's not the only thing they're working on. And they're -- that group that he's put together. But so I think those are things that will come over time in the next few years. That's pretty much what I can tell you about that.\nEdward Kelly: Okay, thank you.\nRichard Galanti: Okay. I'm going to take two more questions, [indiscernible].\nOperator: And for the next question, we have Laura Champine from Loop Capital. Laura, your line is open.\nLaura Champine: Thanks, Richard. [Indiscernible], it's a follow-on. I mean, you'd mentioned that renewal rates are still headed higher in part because of likely because of the auto renew. What percentage of your membership is on auto renew at this point?\nRichard Galanti: It's about 50 in the U.S and Canada, which would imply and that's where we have the co-brand cards. And U.S and Canada is about 80% of our company. So the 50 be-comes a 40 if you, rough numbers.\nLaura Champine: Got it.\nRichard Galanti: Oh, I\u2019m sorry, you can do it on any card, not just co-brand. But in the U.S and Canada it's about 50.\nLaura Champine: Understood. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And for our last question, we have Kelly Bania from BMO Capital, Kelly, your line is open.\nKelly Bania: Oh, thanks for squeezing me in here. Just wanted to talk Richard about the -- just the inflationary environment. And you've talked a little bit in the past couple quarters about how your price gaps have widened. Do you think this kind of magnitude of inflation is just good for Costco's business? I mean, have you seen anything like this in the past where it could possibly just drive even more volume into your doors?\nRichard Galanti: I mean, from an argument that things are more costly. On the one hand, maybe it reduces demand overall, on the sense that we're the extreme value proposition that helps us. So who the heck knows. I think I was reading this morning and the paper was -- this is the highest inflation in so many years. Wasn't that long ago, though, 10 plus years ago that regular inflation was 2% or 3% a year. And of course, it's going to be a little more right for a year. But at the end of the day, I think it helps us a little, because of the value proposition that we have.\nKelly Bania: That makes sense. And a lot has been asked here, but just wanted to also just check on self checkout and where you are with that. And if there's any color, you can help us understand on the savings or the impact on the cost structure when you put in some self checkout and the potential for that initiative going forward.\nRichard Galanti: We pretty much have it now in most locations. And I'm speaking of the U.S. and Canada. And I know even across the street in many locations, we've expanded it from originally, two lanes of three or six to three lanes of three or even four lanes of three. So in a four lane area, you could have 12 people checking out. And so my guess is still going to grow a little as we expand existing units to offer a little bit more of it. And it's been a positive.\nKelly Bania: Okay, thank you.\nRichard Galanti: Well, thank you everyone and have a good holiday season and we're around to answer additional questions. Have a good day.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Galanti",
            "content": "Thank you, Anne, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the Company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal '22, the 12 weeks ended November 21st. Net income for the quarter came in at $1.324 billion or $2.98 per diluted share compared to $1.166 billion or $2.52 per diluted share last year. This year included a cash benefit of $91 million or $0.21 this year related to stock-based compensation and a write-off of certain IT assets of $118 million pre-tax or $0.20 per share. Last year include a tax benefits of $145 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, $0.16 of which was due to the deductibility of the $10 per share special cash dividend received by the company's 401(k) plan participants and $0.17 related to stock-based compensation as well an incremental expenses for COVID-19 premium wages of $212 million pre-tax, which was a hit last year in the quarter of $0.35 per share. Net sales for the quarter increased 16.7% to $49.42 billion, up from $42.35 billion a year earlier in the first quarter. Same-store sales for the first quarter were as follows: In the U.S., on a reported basis for the 12 weeks, up 14.9% and excluding gas inflation and the impacts of FX, up 9.9%. Canada reported 17.2% ex gas and FX plus 8.3%. Other international reported 13.4 ex gas and inflation in FX up 10.9% Total the company reported a 15% increase on a comp basis and 9.8% up ex gas and FX. And e-commerce which was reported at a 14.3 ex FX was 13.3. In terms of Q1 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 6.8% worldwide and at 5.9% in the U.S during the quarter. Our average transaction or ticket was up 7.7% worldwide and 8.5% in the U.S during the quarter. Excluding the positive impact from gas inflation and FX, the average ticket was up ex that plus 2.5% worldwide and plus 3.5% in the U.S. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S dollar positively impact sales by about 90 basis points and gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 430 basis points. Next on the income statement. Membership fee income reported in the quarter of $946 million, up $85 million or 9.9% from last year's $861 million figure. ex FX, the $85 million increase would have been 80 million, and the 9.9% increase would be 9.3%. In terms of renewal rates, our U.S and Canada rate came in at 91.6%, up three tenths of a percent from the 12 week earlier figure at Q4 end as well the worldwide rate came in at 89.0%, also up three tenths of a percent from 12 weeks ago at Q4 quarter end -- Q4 end. The renewal rates are continuing to benefit from more members auto renewing as well as increased penetration of executive members who on average renew at a higher rate than the non-executive members and first year renewal rates which have improved a lot. In terms of number of members at the end of first quarter, in terms of member households as well as total card holders, at Q1 end, total paid households was 52.5 million, up 800,000 from 61.7 a quarter ago, and total cardholders 113.1 million, up a $1.5 million from the 111.6 million 12 weeks ago. At Q1 end paid executive members totaled 26.5 million, an increase of 836,000 during the 12 weeks since Q4 end. The executive members represent 42% of our members and a little over 70% of our sales. Moving down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin for the first quarter was lower year over year by 49 basis points and excluding gas inflation lower year-over-year by 6 basis points. As I normally do, I ask you to jot down a few numbers. There are two columns both reported year-over-year in Q1 and then without gas inflation year-over-year in Q1. First line item would be core merchandise, minus 3x minus 63 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis and minus 26 basis points without gas inflation. Ancillary and other businesses plus two on a reported basis and plus 12x gas -- to gas inflation. 2% reward plus 3 and 1 basis point. LIFO minus three in both columns. Other plus 12 basis points in both columns. Total then are reported basis margins were down 49 basis points year-over-year and ex gas inflation down 6 basis points. In terms of the core merchandise component gross margin being lower by 63 year-over-year and 26 basis points ex gas inflation. Recall last year in Q1 the core reported was up 83 basis points and ex gas up 66 basis points. So we've retained a good portion of the improvement from 2 years ago in the core. In terms of the core margin on their own sales in the first quarter, our core and core margins were lower by 18 basis points, with non foods slightly up and food sundries. slightly lower year-over-year. Also lower year-over-year fresh foods was the primary driver of the core on core being lower in the quarter. Fresh continues to lap -- to lap exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outside sales that began the year -- that happened a year ago in the quarter. Ancillary another business gross margin was higher by 2 basis points on a reported basis and again plus 12 basis points ex gas inflation. Gas and travel were better year-over-year as they anniversary a softer quarter a year ago, offset by e-com, which was particularly strong a year ago and also related to the pandemic. LIFO, we had a 3 basis point or $14 million LIFO charge in the quarter. 2% reward higher by 3 on a reported basis and lower by one excluding gas inflation, a reflection of slightly higher sales penetration going to the increased number of executive members,. And other was up 12 basis points. This is related to COVID related costs from a year ago. That portion of the COVID related wages that go into the cost of sales like many of our manufacturing businesses and our bakery departments, given the inflationary pressures and our ongoing efforts to mitigate price increases to our members in the face of inflation as best we can, our Q1 gross margins results on all I think we're pretty good. Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the first quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 66 basis points and 29 basis points excluding gas inflation, again jotting down two columns of numbers. First column being reported and the second column being ex gas inflation. Operations was better or lower by 40 basis points and ex gas inflation better or lower by 11 basis points. Central reported better by 10. Without inflation, gas inflation better by 6, stock compensation better by 2 and worse by 1 in the two columns, and other better by 14 and better by 13 year-over-year. Total then again on a reported basis, our SG&A was better or lower by 66 basis points, and ex gas inflation lower or better by 29 basis points. The -- keep in mind, in terms of the core again better by 40 or better by 11 ex gas inflation. Keep in mind this result includes the permanent dollar and hour wage increase that began in March of 2021. And 4 weeks of additional starting wage increases that we just took this past October going from $16 to $17 and from $16 -- $15 to $18 for our two main categories of hourly employees. These latest changes in the starting wages went into effect October 25, just 6 weeks ago, and 4 weeks of those 6 weeks are included in Q1 - and Q1. Central, that's it no surprises there. Again, ex gas inflation basis better by 6. Stock comp as I mentioned a little better, a little worse by 1 ex gas inflation and other the 14 and the 13 basis points numbers. This consistent of the COVID expense of 150 million -- $159 million last year and the $180 million write off of the impacted IT assets that I mentioned earlier. Next on the income statement is preopening expense. This year in the quarter $28 million, last year in the quarter 22 or 6 million higher. All told, reporting operating income in the first quarter increased 18% coming in at $1.693 billion this year in the quarter compared to $1.43 billion last year. Below the operating income, line interest expense was $39 million each of the first quarters of fiscal '21 and '22. Interest income, interest expense rather, interest income and other for the quarter was higher by 13 million year-over-year, primarily due to favorable FX. Overall reported pre-tax income in the first quarter was up 19% coming in at $1.696 billion. This year compared in the first quarter last year of $1.42 billion. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the first quarter of '22 was 20.7% compared to 16.8% in Q1 last year. Again both years tax rates benefited from the tax treatment of stock-based compensation as mentioned earlier. $91 million this year and $75 million last year in the quarter. Additionally, last year's tax rate benefited from the tax deductibility of a special dividend, that portion payable to the company's 401(k) plan participants. For fiscal '22, effective tax rate excluding these discrete items is currently projected to be between 26% and 27%. A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, as you know, for fiscal '21, we opened 22 units including to reload. So a net increase of 20 units during fiscal '21. And this quarter that ended a couple of weeks ago, we opened nine units including one relo, So net openings of 8. For the remainder of the year, we plan to open 23 new units, and also -- print open 23 units, 4 of which would be relocations. So in that '19 if all goes as planned. It's been a busy past seven days. We opened our second Costco in France last Saturday on December 4, followed by our second building in China, which opened yesterday, as well as two buildings opening this morning -- opening today, one in the U.S in Florida and our fourth unit in Spain. Regarding CapEx, our first quarter fiscal '22 spend was approximately $1.05 billion. Our full year CapEx spend is estimated to be just about $4 billion. This would represent an increase of more than $400 million over last year's entire CapEx figure of $3.6 billion. The largest areas have increased coming from international spending for new warehouse expansion and increased investment in our logistics and e-com fulfillment operations. In terms of e-commerce, sales in the quarter ex FX increased 13.3% year-over-year. That's of course on top of the 86% plus increase a year ago in the first quarter. Stronger departments in terms of year over percentages include jewelry, tires and home furnishings. Our largest merchandise department in terms of sales majors, which is everything from consumer electronics and TVs to appliances, etcetera, was up in the high single digits also on a very strong sales increase a year earlier. In terms of an update on Costco logistics, it continues to drive our big and bulky sales. For the quarter, Costco logistics deliveries were up over 50% and now represent about 70% of our U.S e-com big and bulky shipments. Average -- with average during the quarter more than 50,000 stops per week. And for the year, we project more than $3 million stops, which would be anything from dropping something off to installing and taking away the old plans. For logistics in the full year, Our e-com mobile app. We continue to improve the site with additional features thus far as I've talked about the last few quarters of quarterly calls. We redesigned the app Header and Footer, we've updated and improved the menu layout. Our members now have the ability to view warehouse receipts online via both the app and desktop. Our co-brand Citi Visa card is now linked. It can now be linked to the digital membership card and can be used for payment. Our members are now able to much more easily reschedule e-com deliveries in the U.S and Canada. Same goes for rescheduling returns pickups and delivering in the first half of the new upcoming new calendar year. Labelling of fulfillment a better labeling of fulfillment methods. Members can -- it will be easily the -- will be able to easily see fulfillment options, be at e-com same day, and even nearby warehouse availability of a particular item at a particular item level. We're rolling out new e-com kiosks in the warehouse with video signage and easy touch screen ordering as well. We're rolling out e-commerce lockers. Currently in the U.S., we have 112 locations with more and --- we plan to more than double that number during calendar year 2022. In terms of e-commerce, there's a program that received some press yesterday just yesterday called Costco next, in a way it's like our warehouse road shows, but online, currently, there are 34 suppliers and growing, but it's still quite small, offering just under 1,000 items, curated items with Costco values, so please check it out when you have a chance. From a supply chain perspective, similar issues that we outlined in 12 weeks ago on the last quarter we call. Each issue ebbs and flows a little bit. But overall, the factors pressuring supply chains and inflation include port delays, container challenges, COVID disruptions, shortages of various components, raw materials, ingredients, and even packaging supplies, labor cost pressures and truck driver challenges. Overall, we feel we've dealt pretty well with the supply chain challenges in terms of delayed container arrivals on the Pacific Coast. About 79% of our import containers are late by an average of 51 days. A few percentage of those were actually a few days early and many of them are a few days more than 51 late. Virtually all departments are impacted. We've ordered early in many cases as I mentioned, I think in earlier calls, given the lower longer lead times, less product and packaging challenges, but still quite a bit. Still some limitations on key items, but improving again, it ebbs and flows. Chip shortage is still impacting many items, some more than others. In some instances, delayed inventory simply extends the season, an example might be lawn and garden and patio. As soon as the product arrives, it sells pretty quickly. But it may extend into beyond the normal seasonal time, toys and seasonal in fact, same thing, some inventory, in fact, won't make it before Christmas, but we've mitigated that as best as possible, and feel pretty good about it. And in terms of moving on to -- despite all the supply chain issues, again, we're pretty -- feel pretty good about staying in stock and continuing to work to mitigate cost and price increases as best we can. Moving on to inflation. Again, it's pretty much the same story that we told during each of the last two quarters. There have been there have been in our variety of inflationary pressures that we and others are seeing, from labor costs to freight costs to higher demand to container shortages and port delays to increase demand on certain product categories. Much of what you see and read out there are very shortages on everything from chips to oils and chemical supply by facilities hit by the Gulf store was a while back, higher commodity prices. For Q1 '22, and talking with our merchants and merchants, we estimate that overall year-over-year price inflation to be in the 4.5% to 5% range. That's a little bit higher of an estimated inflation rate that I discussed a quarter ago. But I think pretty consistent with what you read out there. All the said, much kudos to the job that our merchants and our traffic department and our operators have all been able to do in order to get the products that we need to pivot when and where necessary and keep our warehouses full. While keeping prices low for our members and continuing to show value versus our competitors. Look I think overall this is reflect this is best reflected in the operating results that we continue to achieve despite these many challenges. Anecdotally on merchandising, holiday stuff has been strong, again, sometimes it depends on when the merchandise gets in. Baking items more people seem to be getting together a strong -- gift cards are up, dramatically from a year ago, but it was weak a year ago. Pet products as you might expect are strong with the benefit of increasing pet population over the past couple of years. Alcohol [ph] and spirits are strong, including gift boxes of various items. And, of course continued strength in consumer electronics, appliances, furniture and mattresses and the like. Apparel actually has enjoyed much stronger sales growth this year,. albeit compared to a relatively flat apparel sales a year ago. One last comment. Our sustainability commitment website received a major refresh this week. So please feel free to visit the site. It's linked directly from our homepage under the column about us and then click on sustainability commitment. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our December sales results for the 5 weeks ending Sunday January 2, on Wednesday, January 5 after market close. With that I will open it up to questions and turn it back over to Sadie. Thank you. Well, I think as it relates to a passing on, we've always said we want to be the last to raise the price in the -- first to lower the price, recognizing there's a limit to what you can do based on these cost increases. First and foremost, I think because of our relative purchasing power and our relationships with our vendors, we with our suppliers work to mitigate those increases in any way shape or form we can, Ultimately that may include us taking a little more less markup and maybe then taking a less markup. There's no complete, consistent answer throughout as you might expect. But overall, I think we've done a relatively good job of that and there is inflation in those numbers, those numbers are kind of a combination of our cost increases as well as our some price increases and, again, it fluctuate there. For every few examples of something going up, there may be an example of something flatter, going down a little bit for unrelated reasons. And so again, it's a best guess, it's fluid. We saw inflation starting several months ago in a bigger way, I think, in our fiscal Q4 this summer, and continuing into this fiscal year and as we all have read articles, general articles out there about certain different major consumer product manufacturers announcing increases and continue to do so. So I think it's going to continue, hopefully, we're getting towards the top and it'll start flattening out and subsiding. But we'll see. So I think I'm the last comment, yes, in terms of that last comment you made. Look, I think, at the end of the day, I think we -- in many ways have benefited from market share gains. Hopefully some or most of which will be sticky. The biggest thing that impacts margins many often is not only on the buying power side, and arguably, I can't think of any company that has the buying power per item that we do, because we do roughly $200 billion in sales with 4,000 ish items versus anybody else that's doing it with hundreds of thousands of items, or 50,000 items. But I think that having higher levels of sales productivity, particularly in things like fresh foods, helps your margin. We'll keep some of that and we'll use it to be even more competitive and hopefully, build a bigger model a little bit. But I think that some of it is probably structurally there. But as some famous TV actress said, once it's always thought is always going to be something. And, we'll keep fighting that battle out there. But we feel pretty good about some of the structural things that have occurred that hopefully will help us in the future. But we'll have to wait and see. Yes, look, I think that's hopefully how the storybook goes. It's always going to be something but no, look, we Jokes aside, we feel pretty good about structurally what we've been able to accomplish. And part of that is market share with higher sales levels. And we've not stopped the -- what I'll call the buyer creativity of working with suppliers to figure out how to continue to drive greater value. I can think of 50 examples, but at the end of the day, we're continuing to drive value in lots of ways and whether it's changing packaging, or using our volume, moving certain production to different parts of the world. And to take -- to again to make that moat even a little bigger. So I agree with you that so far, the story that you suggested is playing out, and hopefully it'll continue to play out. You too. Well, I think, again, as you just mentioned, November's comps were a shade under outside expectations, still very good, a couple percentage points different than what we had been enjoying the couple of months prior that. Probably the view is a little bit of that was pulling forward. But even within last month's number, the weeks varied, and overall, we're good. But just when it comes -- when it is reduced a little the next day, it's better than you expected. So I think the one thing that I feel good about is, is our in-stocks. Our senior merchant the other day had indicated in his view is that, his feeling is that we're better and stocked than anybody out there. And I think part of that is the fact of limited selection, that we are an item business, we could put something else in place or something. But we've done a pretty good job. I mean, I had a -- with a little bit of a chuckle at a call just yesterday from a reporter asking about how are we doing on cream cheese. And so I checked and [indiscernible] cream cheese shortage out there and the bagel shops are being challenged. We actually got it as the buyer said, it took a little extra work, but we've got all the cream cheese we need. So I think we've done a good job in merchandising. Oh, by the way, the other thing that Bob just mentioned, that even if certain things head south in some way, shape or form like reduction or lack or elimination of certain stimulus items, supply chain at some point is going to get better. As good as our members are, we could do better if we had more supply of certain of those items. Even in some categories in non-food that are up 20% and 30% plus, the buyers view, we're still running out of stuff, or to do better if we had more. And that's not just us, I mean that's -- it's rains on everybody. But I think some improvement in supply chain will be an offset any other things that are detrimental to that thought. I think more of it is just the leverage of sales growth, frankly. Again, taking out the specific COVID related charges that we talked about, and factors we didn't talk about in terms of separating in the press release was that dollar an hour increase we did in March, and the new one that had a small impact in Q1 because it started 6 weeks ago. But in that regard, there's nothing that stands out in my view. And my guess estimate, I'm looking at my guys here, do you -- it was strong -- strong sales would be the number one factor. I think that's -- the answer is yes. And I think that'll be small methodical increases in that thought over the next several years. I mean, it used to be that we talked about when we had 400 warehouses and the average, I'm making those numbers up. So the average was 180. And now the I think we have an average several years later in the high 200s in the U.S at least. And we have a number of units in the 300 to 400 range. I mean, not the hundreds, but 10s of. And so we're looking for more infill. That we've been doing that and if it was 3 to 5 a year, or 3 to 7 a year, in the last 5 years, is it going to be 5 day a year. Could be I don't have that kind of detail in front of me. One thing that was a little lower was from the increases in food and sundries and some food sundries items in fresh. That had spiked even more, it's still up year-over-year, but it spiked a little, it came down a little bit from where it had been. And then we haven't quantified anything specific beyond that. Yes. Look, many of our KS items are of such large volumes. It's not unlike dealing with the comparable large volumes we do in a branded CPG item. And so we're out there, fighting with both of them to try to mitigate those cost increases. KS still grows at a little faster rate than others, but nothing discernible. I think we keep finding new items to do KS with and for a variety of different reasons. And so it continues to drive that brand. But no, I don't think there's a -- we don't see a big difference of how that's changing. It's in the 50% range. Maybe it's slightly higher than that, based on our when we originally bought what's now Costco Logistics, a year and a half ago. We moved over a bunch of volume, we've grown it as well, grown our total base of need. And I think we're slightly above the 50% that we felt we had capacity for at the time. And we certainly have plenty of capacity over the next few years. Mind you, we're spending money on it. Part of our fulfillment and logistics as I think I mentioned on the last quarterly call, within CapEx we had spended $340 million or so on a multi acre million, 1.6 million square foot distribution facility in Southern California. That's for a variety of needs. Some of the -- much of what we bought Innovel acquisition in March or April of 2020, more than 10 million square feet of space around the country, much of its leased. Much of its fine, by the way, but we're not all that was geographically, particularly the big sites, 2 billion square foot sites were an area is where we're stronger relative to where Sears is stronger, or they had most of their business at the time. So we're still spending money on it and upgrading it. But we're -- again, from a merchandising standpoint, we're very excited about it. And it's helped us grow that business in a big way. And given our small market share of many of those items, particularly on the plant side, we feel there's a lot of growth potential for us. Honestly, I can't. I don't have that detail in front of me. Generally speaking, you've got electronics that like TVs and what have you that are going down in price, maybe a little less this year, because there's less promotions because of shortages. I mean, in every budget meeting every 4 weeks were presented examples of items where we're taking down the price of high volume key items by changing the packaging by moving some aspect of manufacturing to another part of the world. And so I don't have the detail here in front of me for that. Sorry. I will -- somebody is just running out of the room to see if they can grab that sheet. And I'll answer it as soon as they get back if you want to ask another question or move on to the next one. But I'll [indiscernible] gets back. Oh, well, as soon as we know you'll know or the day after. The -- look our cash position is strong. One of the things I pointed out is our CapEx is also increasing in a conscious way, notwithstanding that our cash flow from operations is growing at a quite a stronger rate as well. It's something that we've done 4x in 8 years. We and the shareholders seem to like it when we do it, and so I'm not trying to be cute, but we haven't made that decision at this juncture. It's probably a win not if, but when it'll be -- when we do it. I don't have the exact number, but I'm willing to bet, it's 80% plus. I could be wrong, a little bit, but it contracted. Now recognizing with contracts, we might do 1, 2 and 3 year contracts. So we're still benefiting on 3-year stuff. And then if any little on 2-year stuff, and now gone beyond the benefit of the 1-year stuff, And so it's over two or three year period, but our assumption is, is it'll take less than that time to start to normalize somewhat. Is it happen today [indiscernible], yes. But it's -- I think we again, we probably with other large users of freight and containers, have probably done a pretty good job of at least staggering, that not having to do a lot of spot stuff so far. Okay. What they came back with right now is we don't have -- I don't have quickly average ticket changes. But the total spend per executive member compared to a Gold star member is almost 3x. Call it 2.5. Thank you. So you still might have more pennies per gallon, but the margin itself was down. [Indiscernible] e-commerce. Yes, and again, I would read a lot into any of that description. We're just trying to share with everyone directionally what helps it and hurts a little bit. e-commerce just given all the activity, we've gotten expenditures on fulfillment and expansion, and doing what we can over time when we're pulling tickets if we -- if something else happened. I don't view as a big issue from it. It's not whatever -- whether the margins up a little down a little, it's less about competition and more about what's the product mix that month or week. And what else is going on with this rapid expansion and investment in it? It's over a third. So we're third, great. Thank you. I don't have that detail with me. But generally speaking, tires have picked up as an example of an ancillary business. But the Costco auto program is down because there's a shortage of cars out there. Travel is up not where it was pre it was almost back to where it was pre-COVID. And then delta variant hit. And then it was coming back again and then Omicron hit. So it fluctuates pretty quickly. Omicron though, and I'm trying to think the other things. Food courts have come back. Not I don't think they're quite where they were, but they're almost there. Hearing aids have come back. But still, I think slightly below pre-pandemic. Articles doing great. Pharmacy is doing great, helped, frankly, by the shots. We like other retail pharmacies, providing plenty of vaccines. Okay. Well, both in-store and online have picked up. The pickup from things like Instacart for same day fresh skyrocketed during the lock downs in mid to summer, mid to late summer 2020 came down from those peaks, but it's still way above where it was pre-COVID. E-commerce is as you know, because we talk about every quarter is 8% or 9% of our sales on that company. There's $192 billion in sales for the year ended this last August. So that's a lot bigger than it was. 2 years ago, well I think in the last 3 or 4 quarters, the 2 year taxes 100% plus. But notwithstanding that, and part of that is the big and bulky that has helped that number, which we really weren't driving that kind of business in-store anyway. The fact that I think that as we've heard occasionally that notwithstanding some people don't like our mask requirements when we first put them in back in May of 2020, I think overall people felt if I've got to go out I'm going to go out to one place and [indiscernible] stuff. And with taller ceilings and wider aisles and all those things, I got to believe that psychologically that's helped a little bit. At the end of the day, we were all surprised by [indiscernible] March of 2020, we're surprised by the strength in non-foods categories, summer and fall of 2020, much less now -- much the same now. It was because people weren't travelling, and they weren't going to games and concerts, but they were buying things for their home. And we certainly had on top of all the food items, all the other things they could buy for their home. So that was a pleasant surprise to us and that's continued. In terms of other tests, not a whole lot. I mean, we did have that small test in New Mexico with buy online and pick up in store. [Indiscernible] as I mentioned on the call, we have over -- a year from now have over 200 of our U.S warehouses with lockers. In terms of buying online, pick up in store, we're not quite sure about that. We have very busy locations, there's not a lot of room for it. And it doesn't seem to be a lot of people clamoring [indiscernible] or half the people that come in and do that on a few things that we buy online and the lockers, they come in and shop while they're there. And so that's what we want. So beyond that, I don't think -- I think some of the things we're doing that I mentioned briefly about mobile and digital, some of these things everybody else have, we are sometimes late to the game on some of these things. But those are -- should be on that additive to what we do. I don't know exactly. I know that consciously they -- the buyers when they presented the budget meetings or talking about those issues, we are bringing in things early. We certainly have -- you think about it, what we call our depot, our view of distribution system in the U.S was something like 10 million square feet. And we essentially slightly more than double that with the Innovel acquisition, aside from other things that helps us with a little storage if we needed or bringing in things early. Recognizing we start with we are somewhat seasonal, but historically volleys brought things in early anyway. So we've -- whatever it may be, we certainly have the cash, as somebody mentioned earlier, to have some extra billion dollars invested in inventory, even if it hangs around for a little bit. But I think overall, some of our items are still a little later than they would be pre-COVID. But better than they would be if we were not doing as good a job as I think we are doing on forward buying. When I said it was 19 more in the last three quarters of the year, fiscal year, plus the [indiscernible]. Sure. I think previous as relates to this year, we had talked about, I think 3.8 to 4.2 quote unquote, now we're saying about four. These numbers are up from the mid threes over the last couple of year, low to mid threes over the last couple of years. In fact, last year's 3.6 included a $340 million or $345 million asset purchase that I mentioned earlier in the Southwest, in Southern California, which is basically a 1.5 million plus square foot facility with lots of acreage to help with our fulfillment as well as our import stuff. And so I think there's, if you said what are the big things take you from the low threes to the low fours over a few years a period, it's more international expansions, which tends to be a little more expensive for location, more expansion, we -- in fiscal '20, we were down to 13 net new units because some delays with COVID. I think we were 20 and 21 and we're going to be 27 net new units this fiscal year. plus five relos, which is -- six relos planned. We might miss that a little bit. But at the end of the day, so there's more warehouses. Clearly more in the whole fulfillment concept, starting with the $1 billion acquisition a year ago of what's now Costco Logistics, starting with adding additional square footage to that, as well as the international things. And even on the distribution side, or what we call our cross stock depots, spending money overseas now in some of these countries to do some of that in a better way. Actually building a mini depot in Hawaii, where we have five locations? Seven, I'm sorry. Seven locations, but huge volume locations. And with a -- so we've gotten to the volume and efficiency there that these are good investments. So it's a lot of those things. Mind you, we still spend all in close to a $1 billion a year here in IT. That's -- by the way, that's not all CapEx, that's expenses, go ahead I'm sorry. I don't know for the long-term, I think four sounds about right for the next year or two. And if things continue to grow well -- go well and grow well, maybe goes up from there a little bit. But we're not looking to spend it if we don't think we have good things to spend it on just because our cash flow has been exceeding net income plus -- our cash flow has been exceeding regular dividend plus capital expenditures, and the like. I think it's -- I don't have the exact number, but my guess is it's a small low to mid single-digit percentage. What it means though is when back -- going back all the way back to spring of 2020 and there were -- people were hoarding goods. We were going out to additional suppliers to see what we can get recognizing from their perspective, it creates a new relationships, which will honor. You only forward not just for the three months that we [indiscernible]. And so I think there were opportunities to just expand product brands by necessity into some things, and with I think the -- going into last summer and fall with that advent of all the things for the home, both patio furniture and [indiscernible] and barbecue grills and indoor furniture and electronics and gadgets for the kitchen, we took advantage of that and brought in additional items. And so it's more of that than anything. And the treasure hunt, yes. So it's still a small piece, but I think it's -- when I sometimes -- when I go into some retailers, I'm not going to go into any names, but you'll see a shelf half empty or some spaces. First of all, once you put something in there and but at the end of the day, I think our buyers have done a very good job of keeping the warehouses full. You're breaking up entirely during that call. So I heard about every other word, if you want to repeat yourself. From a competitive standpoint, I mean, there's lots of -- everybody is competitive. Again, I think structurally our model allows us to [indiscernible] that. We talked about more pennies per gallon of profit that allows us to do some other things. I think we've got a -- I think we have a lot of levers to pull here. And we feel pretty good that we are able to hold the prices on key items. And to -- I don't really think that we consider the challenge of achieving a margin. We're pretty good at figuring out how to get there, while still being the company we are in terms of competitiveness. So no big changes of what we see out there. Just there's a lot of changes every month, and some things go up and some things go down. But overall, we feel pretty good about it. I think there's still low hanging fruit on the tree here. We've talked about it a little bit, we've done a little bit more targeting than we have ever done, but very little, there is more to come. It was just a year and a half ago, that we hired someone at a relatively senior level in terms of data analytics. But that's not the only thing they're working on. And they're -- that group that he's put together. But so I think those are things that will come over time in the next few years. That's pretty much what I can tell you about that. Okay. I'm going to take two more questions, [indiscernible]. It's about 50 in the U.S and Canada, which would imply and that's where we have the co-brand cards. And U.S and Canada is about 80% of our company. So the 50 be-comes a 40 if you, rough numbers. Oh, I'm sorry, you can do it on any card, not just co-brand. But in the U.S and Canada it's about 50. I mean, from an argument that things are more costly. On the one hand, maybe it reduces demand overall, on the sense that we're the extreme value proposition that helps us. So who the heck knows. I think I was reading this morning and the paper was -- this is the highest inflation in so many years. Wasn't that long ago, though, 10 plus years ago that regular inflation was 2% or 3% a year. And of course, it's going to be a little more right for a year. But at the end of the day, I think it helps us a little, because of the value proposition that we have. We pretty much have it now in most locations. And I'm speaking of the U.S. and Canada. And I know even across the street in many locations, we've expanded it from originally, two lanes of three or six to three lanes of three or even four lanes of three. So in a four lane area, you could have 12 people checking out. And so my guess is still going to grow a little as we expand existing units to offer a little bit more of it. And it's been a positive. Well, thank you everyone and have a good holiday season and we're around to answer additional questions. Have a good day."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Costco Wholesale Corporation Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 Operating Results Call. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Richard Galanti, CFO. Please go ahead, sir.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the Company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, the 17 weeks ended September 3. These results and the figures presented today compare to last fiscal year's 16-week fourth quarter. Reported net income for the 17-week fourth quarter came in at $2.16 billion or $4.86 per diluted share, compared to $1.868 billion or $4.20 per diluted share in the 16-week fourth quarter last year. In terms of sales, net sales for the 17-week fourth quarter were $77.43 billion, an increase of 9.4% from $70.76 billion in the 16-week fourth quarter last year. Comparable sales for the fourth quarter, and these figures are like-for-like number of weeks. In the U.S., reported was 0.2% comp. Excluding gas deflation and FX in the U.S., it would have been 3.1%. Canada, reported was 1.8%, and excluding gas deflation and FX, 7.4%. Other International reported 5.5%, and again excluding gas deflation and FX, 4.4%. Also total Company reported 1.1% comp and 3.8% ex-gas deflation and FX. In terms of e-commerce, that came in at minus 0.8% reported and minus 0.6% excluding FX. Overall for the fiscal fourth quarter, food and sundries were relatively strong once again, with fresh foods right behind and with some offsets on some of the non-foods categories. In terms of Q4 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 5.2% worldwide and 5.0% in the United States. Our average transaction or ticket was down 3.9% worldwide and down 4.5% in the U.S., impacted in large part from weakness in bigger ticket non-foods discretionary items, as well as the gas price deflation. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 0.3%, and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 2.5%. Next on the income statement, membership fee income reported in the fourth quarter $1.509 billion or 1.95% of sales in the fourth quarter this fiscal year, compared to $1.327 billion or 1.88% in Q4 of last year, so $182 million increase or 13.7%. If you adjust for the extra week, the 13.7% would be roughly 7%, ex that extra week. Excluding FX and the extra week, the increase would have been around 7.5%. In terms of renewal rates at Q4 end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rates stood at 92.7%, which is up 0.1% from the 92.6% figure as of the end of Q3. The worldwide rate came in at 90.4%, down 0.1%, reflecting the impact of increasing penetration of memberships from international, which renew at a lower rate, in large part because of new openings internationally. Our membership growth continues. We ended the fourth quarter with 71.0 million paid household members, up 7.9% versus a year ago, and 127.9 million cardholders, up 7.6%. That's on the new openings over the past year of - just under 3% increase in new locations. At the fourth quarter end, we had 32.3 million paid executive memberships, an increase of 981,000 during the 17 weeks since Q3 end. The executive members now represent a little over 45% of our paid membership and approximately - paid members and approximately 73% of worldwide sales. Moving down the income statement, next is our gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter came in higher - came in at 10.60%, up 42 basis points from 10.18% a year ago, and that 42 basis points is up 16 basis points excluding gas deflation. As I always ask you to jot down a few numbers with two columns, both reported and excluding gas deflation, the first line item would be core merchandise, on a reported basis, up 51 basis points year-over-year in the fourth quarter and ex gas deflation up 28 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses, minus 32 basis points and minus 38 basis points. 2% reward, minus 4 basis points and minus 2 basis points. LIFO, plus 27 basis points and plus 28 basis points. And if you total that up, on a reported basis, gross margin was up 42 basis points year-over-year and ex gas deflation, up 16 basis points. Starting with the core, again, up 51 basis points year-over-year, and ex deflation, up 28 basis points. In terms of core margin on their own sales, our core-on-core margins were higher by 35 basis points, with food and sundries and non-foods being up and fresh foods being down a little. Ancillary and other business gross margin was lower by 32 basis points, and lower by 38 basis points ex gas. This decrease was driven almost entirely by gas due to the other components of ancillary and other, which would include pharmacy, e-comm, food court, business centers, optical, all those things on a relative basis year-over-year were in a couple of basis points plus or minus from a year earlier. 2% reward higher by 4 basis points and higher by 2 basis points, so a negative 2 basis points including gas deflation. That represents higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. And LIFO, of course, if you recall, last year in Q4, we had a $223 million pre-tax LIFO charge, while there was a small charge this year of $30 million on a year-over-year basis. Of course, that showed the basis point improvement in margin. While we continued - we've continue to see sequential improvement in year-over-year inflation. I'll talk about that a little later. We still had a small amount relative to the first day of the fiscal year, that's a small charge in Q4. A couple of final comments on margins. First, we are of - we're asked often recently about our inventory shrinkage results and whether it has dramatically increased in the past year versus historical shrink results. The answer is, no. In the past several years, our inventory shrink has increased by a couple of basis points, in part we believe due to the rollout of self-checkout. Over the past year, it has increased by less than 1 basis point more. So no, thankfully, not a big issue for us. And second, the year-over-year margin improvement has in part been due to fewer markdowns due to better inventory positions this year than last. Our inventories overall are in good shape. Moving onto SG&A, our reported SG&A in the fourth quarter 8.96%, up from 8.53% a year earlier or up 43 basis points, and ex gas deflation up 21 basis points. Again jot down the two columns of numbers, both reported and excluding gas deflation. Operations, minus 37 basis points, minus being higher by and without deflation, core would be minus 18 basis points. Central, minus 6 basis points and minus 3 basis points. And those are the really only two line items. The others were all zero; stock compensation, preopening and other. So, total reported margins were up 43 basis points year-over-year, and ex gas deflation, up 21 basis points. In terms of the core operations being higher by 18 basis points ex gas deflation and on a reported basis higher by 37 basis points, this negative included the impact of lower sales growth as well as the impact of eight weeks of additional top-of-scale wage increases that went into effect July 4 of '22, so midway through Q4 last year, and full 17 weeks of this past March's higher-than-normal top-of-scale increase. Central being higher by 3 basis points ex gas deflation, again not a lot of sales operating leverage there. And again, as I mentioned, the other line items that I typically read out were flat, both with and without gas deflation, so zero year-over-year change. Below the operating income line, interest expense came in at $56 million this year versus $48 million a year ago, one extra week, of course. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $171 million year-over-year, $238 million this year versus $67 million last year. This was driven in large part by an increase in interest income due to both higher interest rates and higher cash balances, as well as the extra week. In addition, FX was slightly favorable year-over-year. In terms of income tax rate, our tax rate this year in the fourth quarter came in at 27.1% compared to 25.4% in Q4 last year, so full 1.7 percentage points higher year-over-year. This increase in our rate as of Q4 is primarily attributable to an increased penetration of international earnings, which overall incurs a higher income tax rate than in the U.S. Overall, reported net income was up 16% year-over-year in the quarter, or 9% if you adjust for the extra week this year quarter - this year in the fourth quarter versus last. A few other items of note, in the fourth quarter, we opened nine net new warehouses, including five new buildings in the U.S., two in China, and one each in Japan and Australia. For the full fiscal '23 year, we finished with 23 net new units, as well as we did three relocations. And for the first quarter, the first 12 weeks of fiscal '24, we plan on opening 10 net new units, as well relocating one unit. All 10 locations net new are in - nine are in the U.S. and one is in Canada. Regarding capital expenditures, we've actually included the cash flow in the quarterly report, but CapEx spend in Q4 was approximately $1.56 billion, and for all of fiscal '23, totaled $4.32 billion. Turning to e-commerce, e-commerce sales in the fourth quarter ex FX, as I mentioned, decreased 0.6% year-over-year. While still negative, relatively speaking, our e-commerce showed good improvement. Results showed good improvement this quarter versus our year-over-year results in Q2 and Q3. In the previous two fiscal quarters, big ticket discretionary majors, home furnishings, small electrics, jewelry and hardware, were down 15% and 20% year-over-year, respectively, and down just 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, with those big ticket departments making up over half of our e-commerce sales. A couple of other items to note. Within the sales of big ticket discretionary, appliance were up over 30% in the quarter. Second, I've gotten a couple of calls that people have seen online that we've been selling gold - 1-ounce gold bars. Yes, but when we load them on the site, they're typically gone within a few hours and we limit two per member. And lastly, I'll point out Costco Next. We continue to grow that. We currently have 62 suppliers on costconext.com, and we're continuing to onboard additional ones in many product areas, from home improvement to apparel, to pet, to home and kitchen, to electronics and accessories, to sports and bicycles and toys and the like. Now, a few comments on e-com mobile digital efforts, which we're always asked about. As I discussed during the last quarter earnings call, when I said that we were in the early innings of our digital mobile transformation efforts, progress is being made. In terms of recent additions and upgrades, we've recently redesigned the account page and the digital membership card. We also redesigned the header with larger search bar and expanded selling space. We've added an app box for messages and advertisements right in the app. We've recently, a few months ago, opened an optical digital store where you can virtually try on glasses and then order them for pickup, prescription glasses. And lastly, there are ongoing improvement in our Costco app, offering in-warehouse shopping tools for our customers such as a digital membership card, managing shopping lists, viewing warehouse savings, seeing the gas prices to the extent there's gas station there, and so you'll be able to search warehouse inventory and scan barcodes from the app. With the improvements made thus far over the past year, our app store rating has gone from a dismal 2.3 stars to currently 4.7 stars. Unique visitors in the site are up 40% year-over-year and the Costco app installs are up 46% year-over-year. So all in all, progress is being made. Lastly, a couple of comments regarding inflation, most recently in Q3 '23, we had estimated that year-over-year inflation was in the 3% to 4% range. Our estimate for Q4, inflation in the 1% to 2% range, and it's actually trended downward during the quarter. So hopefully, these inflation trends will continue. We'll have to see. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, October 1, on Wednesday, October 4, after the market closes. With that, I will open it up for Q&A and turn it back over to Lisa. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: Hi, Richard. How are you?\nRichard Galanti: Good.\nSimeon Gutman: I guess my first question, I don't mean a tongue-in-cheek, but is - I guess, is the membership price increase part of the fiscal plan? And then part of the question is there a point at which this membership increase is part of, I guess the hedge against inflation? Is there a point at which model feels more weight without it, in other words, can you go another year without it?\nRichard Galanti: Well. My pat answer, of course, is a question of when, not if. It's a little longer this time around, since June of '17. So we're six years into it and - but you'll see it happen at some point. We can't really tell you, if it's in our plans or not. We'll let you know when we know. We feel good. These say about all the attributes of member loyalty and member growth. And frankly, in terms of looking at the values that we provide our members, we continue to increase those. It's certainly a greater amount than even more than if and when an increase occurs. So stay tuned. We'll keep you posted, but there's not a whole lot I can tell you about that.\nSimeon Gutman: Fair enough. And then an ultra-short term, as gas prices have moved up, have you seen any effect or impact on spending at the store?\nRichard Galanti: No, I mean, you look at the numbers over the last few months that we report monthly and quarterly. There has not been a heck of a lot change. Big ticket discretionary, while improved relatively as I mentioned online - those online items, we have seen the number of items in the basket tick up a little in the last few months, but I think that has more to do with the fact that we consciously added. I had mentioned in the last call, we've consciously added 40 or 50, what I'll call smaller ticket indulgent items, whether it's snack items and the like, just impulse items. And so that's what we do as merchants, but overall we haven't seen any big change. We've been able to correlate any big change to what's happened with gas prices.\nSimeon Gutman: Hi, thanks, Richard. Good luck.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning - good afternoon, I should say. Thank you so much for taking my question. Richard, you ended your prepared remarks, saying that this quarter or this month inflation is on pace to be 1% to 2% and you suggested it may be even lower than that. So should outside of the reverse be prepared for the prospect of deflation, either because that's what's happening with some underlying cost that Costco has been experiencing or Costco will look to invest in price, as a way to continue to drive volumes, especially at a time when core on core margins are expanding, so nicely?\nRichard Galanti: Well, first of all, your comment that there was 1% to 2%, but then as we looked at the 17 weeks if you are the four months roughly, we saw - if we look at it internally at each of the end of those four months, we saw the level that 1% to 2% is from the beginning to the end of the year - I'm sorry, the beginning at the end of the quarter. But during the quarter, we saw that trending downward, if you will, a little. And when I talk to the merchants on the fresh side, it's flat-to-down a little right now on the food and sundries side, it's up a little, primarily in some of the CPG stuff and on big-ticket - not big-ticket, but our non-foods partly because of freight, which is down year-over-year in a nice way. And in some cases, some of the commodity costs on steel and the like that has come down. So that being said, we're not a big change, but at least it's trending that way. Who knows what tomorrow brings. And as it relates to - well, as I say, as it relates to us, we're always pushing prices as fast as we can. We want to be the first to lower them when those things happen and drive sales.\nMichael Lasser: And so...\nRichard Galanti: I think we've seen that with - I think we've seen that with our traffic.\nSimeon Gutman: So just to clarify what you're saying is food and sundries prices are down on an average year-over-year, shelf-stable products are up year-over-year, gen merch is down. So in totality, it would seem like the store - the box is deflating, does it get - does the rate at which you see deflation continue to increase from here and would you expect that to be just driven by the factors that you mentioned or are you driving that as a way to drive this traffic?\nRichard Galanti: Well, first of all, I want to correct one thing that it maybe I misstated or you misunderstood. In terms of fresh, fresh is pretty much flat. Food and sundries, which has everything from sundries and package goods and CPG goods that tends to be up a little bit. And I'd like to think that we're pushing the envelope as much as we can with our suppliers that has certain freight costs have come down. Recognizing the headline today in the paper is - oil is approaching $100 a barrel. So, who the heck knows what happens tomorrow.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. My follow-up question is, as low - as long as you see big-ticket under pressure, discretionary under pressure, which influences your total sales, because it's important for you to remember to come in and buy these big-ticket items. Is this going to influence how you think about managing labor in the store? Should the market just anticipate late - labor and other SG&A is going to delever as long as the big tickets under pressure?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think we've seen that over the last year, frankly. We had such operating leverage over a couple of years when we had outside sales during the kind of two years of COVID, call the spring of '20 to spring of 2022. And, it was before COVID, when our SG&A was over 10% - slightly over 10%, and we said, would it ever be able to get below that, it's now still below 9%. So, notwithstanding the fact, when I looked at the last several quarters on a year-over-year basis, again, particularly over the last couple of quarters, we've seen some deleverage of that. Look, we want to drive sales and we'll do that in the best ways we can. So - but we recognize when we used to get the question all the time, what comp number do you need to have zero, negative or positive leverage with SG&A, recognizing there was low - very little inflation back then. We used to say somewhere, who knows, but somewhere in the 4.5% to 5% range. So we don't know exactly where it is, but we're certainly not going to change the level of service that we have and we're certainly - you're going to respect our employees in terms of what we've done with wage increases overtime. That's what we do.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you very much and good luck.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.\nChuck Grom: Hi, Richard. Just sticking on this - on the inflation topic here on unit elasticity, particularly in categories where you're seeing prices actually start to fall or compress. Curious, what you're seeing on units, if you're seeing them improve at all to offset those price declines, if there's any examples in either food or in GM that you can talk about?\nRichard Galanti: Well, yes, I remember when we talked to a few quarters ago about some of the slowness in big-ticket discretionary, well, we got harder on price. It did a little bit, but not as much as we would have thought to start with. But again, that perhaps was the impact of what's going on with the concerns of the economy and everything else. We know that when we put hard buys and what we call TPDs, temporary price discounts on items, even medium-sized ticket items, we do see - we do leverage - see the units increase, but it's not as predictable I would say as it used to be.\nChuck Grom: Okay, great. And I know you don't provide guidance, but I got...\nRichard Galanti: It's a little easier on the food side to see that sometimes more, when taking the price of meat item down.\nChuck Grom: Okay. So you are starting to see some units increase as prices drop in certain parts of the business?\nRichard Galanti: Sure. And by - even a big-ticket, when we see $300 and $400 price declines because of freight and raw material cost on some big-ticket non-food items, we'll see some of the sales pick back up on that. But, there's nothing guaranteed.\nChuck Grom: Okay. All right. Thank you. And I know you don't provide guidance, but I actually do remember when you did give some directional help back in the day, but are there any big puts and takes that we should be thinking about on the gross margin and SG&A line over the next four quarters that we should be thinking about? Clearly, the LIFO lap will be it will be an obvious tailwind, but just curious, any other things that we should be thinking about from a modeling perspective?\nRichard Galanti: No not really. I mean, LIFO is certainly one that was impacted over the last year and started to slow down. Assuming that trend continues, there won't be much LIFO going forward for right now what we see. Beyond that, no, we're still opening. We opened 23 net new units this past year. We're on board to do something in the mid-to-high 20s this year. But that's not enough to move the needle in terms of the leverage standpoint or anything. No, I'd say it's steady as she goes. And if anything I look to be the margins overall, given everything that's going on, including competition that we're doing pretty well there. We - with some of the wage hikes that we continue to do and sales being a little weaker than they had been a year ago, I think we're doing pretty well on that as well. We're optimistic about our future, but we'll see what happens.\nChuck Grom: All right, great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Peter Benedict with Baird.\nPeter Benedict: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Richard, just - first one, just on LIFO. I was just curious, I mean, $30 million charge is small, but I'm just curious, why they were even last one. Can you give us little more color, maybe what drove?\nRichard Galanti: Yes, well, I think it was on things like gas was one, and then in some of the fresh food items there was - even though there was deflation in things like eggs and some dairy products, there was - there were some inflationary trends and beef. Beyond that, do you have that handy. Yes, it's really small, but on $16 billion of inventory, it's a lot. I mean, it's still a small number of $30 million and that, but - that's all. I don't have the details on that.\nPeter Benedict: That's fine. Yes, that's fine, just in the context of the broader disinflation it was interesting to see that. And then, just really turning to the international stuff you talked about the rural rates impact, can you remind us maybe on the international membership trends, when you open up a new core outside the U.S., maybe give us some framework or some benchmarks around how many new members tend to sign-up? How does that compare to what you would see, let's say in the next opening in the U.S.? And then, what kind of renewal rates you tend to see year-one, year two, just so we have a frame of reference there? Thank you.\nRichard Galanti: I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but generally speaking, in Asia, whether it's Korea, Taiwan, Japan or China, we'll open a new unit including the 10 or 12 weeks of sign-ups prior to opening, with anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 new members. We had a couple of extremes like when we first opened in Shanghai Minhang of well over 200. Now, some of that looky-loos that don't renew and we usually in that first year of renewal and those types of outsized numbers, we might be as low as the mid-to-high 50s and it takes a few years to get even to the mid-70s. But we see those numbers overall continue to increase every year and I don't - I can't - I don't - I actually probably go back to what it was in the first 10 years of our 40-year history with even the U.S. My guess, it wasn't that extreme, but we didn't have as many - it wasn't national and local news events, the day we opened. We had a lot of people coming into some of these markets that are signing up that may be live too far away or choose not to come back. So we're seeing that continuing to grow. So by - even as simple - that's slight 0.1% decline, it's round the year in the sense that you opened up a couple of more units a year ago, they've just renewing for the first time that increases that number.\nPeter Benedict: Yes. No, understood. Last one, I think I heard you say, mid-to-high 20s in terms of unit opening plan for fiscal '24. Can you give us a sense how many of those are in the U.S. and then how many would be international? Thank you.\nRichard Galanti: 70% plus in the U.S. and Canada, mostly U.S., of course.\nPeter Benedict: Got it.\nRichard Galanti: Which in my view is we're finding more openings - more opportunities in the U.S. to in-fill, given our high volumes. And we got plenty going on over the years, overseas.\nPeter Benedict: Yes. Thanks so much, Richard.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.\nErica Eiler: Good afternoon. This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Thanks for taking our questions. So I guess first, I was hoping maybe you could give us a quick download, maybe on how you're feeling about the health of your consumer right now? I mean, obviously some concerns out there on student loan impact starting to roll in here, those restarts. So maybe any color you can provide on how you're thinking about discretionary from here, maybe some of those concerns out there? Anything on trade down or private-label, anything of note on that front in terms of consumer behavior as well?\nRichard Galanti: Right, well, look, first of all, first and foremost, our traffic continues to do very well. Being up continually 4% to 5% on a year-over-year basis is great. And our renewal rates continue to be very strong. So that's the starting point. It makes sense to us on big-ticket discretionary that's where you'd see the biggest weakness. We see some of that in some areas going back. When we look at our numbers compared to MBD, that tells us where we are versus our competitors. Overall, not in every category, but overall we tend to do better. So even a negative number here is a lower negative number elsewhere. So - and again, what do we do, we brought in some smaller ticket items that are impulse snack items to get an extra partial item in everybody's basket. So, yes and newness, bringing those new items. And there's not been a whole lot in television. Our unit sales and TVs are pretty good, but the average price point has come down, as they do anyway, there's always deflationary. When you don't have new technology yet and that's just, we haven't seen a whole lot of new stuff yet there. Gaming is good right now and Christmas is good. I mean, we're one of the - not the only one, but one of the few that are bringing in seasonal items early, everything from decor to trees, to toys, that's starting off well so far. But it's new, it's in the last few weeks.\nErica Eiler: Okay, that's really helpful. And then just - go ahead.\nRichard Galanti: I'm sorry, what else did you ask?\nErica Eiler: And then just shifting gears, so, I just wanted to touch on Retail Media. So obviously a significant focus on driving retail media at some of your peers. So just curious if you could maybe talk a little bit about what Costco is doing in this area and the bigger opportunities that your team sees here?\nRichard Galanti: Well, part of that is some of the things we're doing with digital and mobile and the app. And we're not giving out quantifiable numbers, but certainly, some of our competitors are talking about doubling these numbers in the next two or three years. In my view, there is some low-hanging fruit out there and we're actively working on it. We've hired a couple of people that are helping us with that as well and more to come.\nErica Eiler: Okay, great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Paul Lejuez with Citigroup.\nBrandon Cheatham: Hi, everyone. This Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. I just wanted to - when you look at the retail landscape, I was wondering, how did your wages compare to your competition? Are you seeing similar trends in inflation pressure on the wage front and anything that you can help us with, what your plans are over the next couple of quarters?\nRichard Galanti: Well. First of all, we've always prided ourselves in providing the best hourly wage package out there, wages, benefits, contributions to 401(k). I'm using U.S. numbers here, but our average U.S. - 90% of our employees like many big retailers are hourly. And our average hourly wage is approaching $26 is in the high-$25s. That's on top of a very rich healthcare plan, where the employee only pays around 11% or 12% of it I believe. And on top, little less than that - and on-top of that, irrespective of what employee contributes to his or her 401(k), we contribute anywhere from 3% to 9% based on years of service. So you've got a 20-year cashier making on a full-time basis in the mid-60s with another $4,000 or $5,000 being contributed to his or her 401(k) plan with a very rich healthcare plan. So we stand apart in our view compared to anybody. Our pressure is that, it comes from ourselves. In the last few years, as there have been wage pressure, starting with the frontline workers during the beginning of COVID, we like many retailers added a 2% premium - $2 premium rather. We kept it longer to our knowledge than most anybody for a full year and at the end, we kept a dollar in there. And since then we've had at least three or four increases on top of the normal top-of-scale increase that we do every - generally have done every year - we have done every year. So we'll - in our view, the pressure comes from us and we feel that we're way ahead of our competition in that regard.\nBrandon Cheatham: Got it. That's helpful, thanks. And I think you mentioned the next iteration of the app, you're going to be able to scan barcodes. Is the idea that eventually the customer are going to be able to scan and go and how could that help flow operations in your stores, if that is the case?\nRichard Galanti: I don't think we're prepared for Scan and Go, yet. We're just going to scan, but they can't go. So at the end of the day, the first order of business is getting the merchandise on there and haven't had numbers that where a member, he goes online to say, hey, you can also get this currently at your local location. So knowing what's in store when somebody wants to come out, I think that's going to be a big positive to start with and part of the scan is to be able to get more product information on the item as well.\nBrandon Cheatham: Sure, that makes sense. Okay, I appreciate it. Good luck.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Greg Melich with Evercore.\nGreg Melich: Hi, thanks. I have two questions, Richard. First, I'd love an update given the volatility in gas prices last year and a half is to, where we are on penny profit? I know it has improved a lot, but I'm curious it came back down in the last 12 months or if it's sort of stabilized at that higher level?\nRichard Galanti: Well, we don't give specific numbers. Gas has been stronger for us and we believe all retailers in the last few years. In fact, it was Q4 last year, which I think it was our strongest quarter, recognizing it's 16-week quarter. This fourth quarter, it was still strong, down from its strongest a year earlier on a weekly basis, but nonetheless quite strong. And so it's part of the profit picture currently of all big retailers that sell gas, the supermarkets, the Walmarts and the Costcos of the world. So it's still a profitable business. It's - our view has been, you used to be when prices - given that the return it so fast, literally almost daily, when profits are going up - I'm sorry, when the price of gas is going up, the guy down the street is turning it every eight or nine days is paying a little less four days ago. And so we're making it the less, when sales went down - gallons - the price per gallon went down, we made a little more. I think that equation, while it's still true, is not the driver of the bottom line of gas. Everybody seems to be wanting to make more on gas, which allows us in our view to make a little more and still be even more profitable. We've seen our competitive spread versus our direct competitors at every location on average improve over the last couple of years to now be in the - I want to say to 30-set range per gallon, mid-30s is the average, which is up. It's an average and it can range from 10 to 45. But at the end of the day, we feel good about our competitive position, it's increased and we're still quite profitable down a little bit from a year ago, but nonetheless quite profitable.\nGreg Melich: That's helpful, thanks. And then my follow up is on cash. I think you finished with $13.7 billion. I think the last time you got to 2013 was when you had a special dividend in 2020. What are your thoughts on how much cash you need or want? And especially now that there is a positive interest rate on holding cash, because that would make you more interested in keeping it, than you pay more tax, just how do you think about?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think, look, at the end of day, we've done four special dividends in the past. It's part of our DNA. At some point, we may do that again. Again somewhat like the answer to the other question about membership fees, it's probably a question of when, not if, but we'll let you know. Certainly with earning 5%-ish on that money instead of a clear percent-ish on that money, does make it a little harder to do. But we're not selling the kind of earnings multiple, but we earn 5% on our assets. So, at some point, we'll do something and we'll have to wait and see.\nGreg Melich: Got it. Thanks and good luck.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.\nKelly Bania: Hi, thanks for taking our question, Richard. Just wanted to ask, I think I've asked this many, many times, but it seems like another huge quarter for executive membership growth of almost 1 million more this quarter. And just curious if you could talk about the profile of that member today that's either upgrading or starting out as an executive? What's the characteristics of that customer? And any changes in how that executive member spends in their first year in that upgrade, compared to the prior years?\nRichard Galanti: I was joking you're going to say, first of all, they are very smart to be an executive member. Look, I think we are over the time, we've done a better job of communicating the value of the executive member. So, we clearly get more people to sign up that way in advance and we see that over time a regular member over the first few years will buy more every year and executive members start at a higher level and will buy more every year from that higher level. So that's really the profile that we've seen. I don't have any specifics on how old the member is. I know that when we look at age characteristics of new members, we're still - everybody used to be concerned 10 years ago, how we going to get millennials when we have an older average customer and all that and we did with things, with items, with things like organic. We're doing the same thing now. We're still getting whether it's Gen Z or Gen A or whatever the next is, we're getting our share of those new members when we look at the profile of our members.\nKelly Bania: Thanks, and Richard, I may have missed this, but did you quantify the extra week impact in terms of EBIT or EPS or anything for us?\nRichard Galanti: No, it's - I mean, the simple math would just say it's 16, 17 of our quarter is equal to a 16-week quarter. That's about as good as we can do.\nKelly Bania: Okay. Thank you.\nRichard Galanti: I think that particularly on net income it takes the 16% or whatever percent number down to 9% or something, and that's just simple math.\nKelly Bania: Perfect.\nOperator: Okay. We'll take our next question from Oliver Chen with TD Cowen.\nOliver Chen: Hi, Richard, inventories being well-positioned, what are your thoughts about where they are now and versus - and also how we will model them going forward relative to sales? And then as we look at overall, ticket trending negative, that compare starts to ease. So does that imply that one flexion on partly the nature of the ticket comparisons overall? The same question is for e-commerce, as you anniversary some of the headwinds, can we expect the comparison to help as well? Thanks a lot, Richard.\nRichard Galanti: Sure. Inventories, as I mentioned, we feel - the merchants feel very good about our inventory levels right now. Are there a few departments are higher than they want, a few that need a little bit more sure. But overall, they're very good. Look at our fiscal year and inventories stood at just under $16.7 billion and payables stood at $17.5 billion. So I think this - running above 100% on that simple ratio is something new. We used to be - we used to enjoy running 90% to 95%, it fluctuates, but overall, we feel good about our inventories, where they are now. And in terms of supply chain, things coming in on time, we feel good about that as well. Now as it relates to - as we, excuse me, as we anniversary the inflection of when we saw some weakness, I think a couple of quarters ago, I mentioned that will help your big-ticket sales, I said, well, at least in a few several more months we'll anniversary this weakness. So certainly that's going to help. I would like to think that not just that thing that's going to help, but - and the same would be commerce. I mean, we're - again one bright spot in this virtually all e-commerce, not nearly always - is nearly always e-commerce was the appliances that - and I think we've done a better job also of showing the value of these items online, not just the price the item within our case includes delivery and warranty and things like that more so than some of our competitors. And showing great value there.\nOliver Chen: Okay. Thanks, Richard. Just a couple of short ones, would love any thoughts on Instacart. It seems like it's a great partnership that you've had for a while. Also another question we have is, EV charging play a role and how you're thinking about future services for customers? Finally, China, any - it's a smaller percentage of total, but it's an important market for the long-term. I mean lots happening there. Has anything changed the value proposition or the geopolitics? Thanks.\nRichard Galanti: Okay. Yes. I had the second and third, what was the first question? Oh, Instacart, I know they just went public. So we've gotten a lot of questions. At the end of the day, we were good partner with them, they were good partner for us. We used them throughout the U.S. and Canada. And as sales are growing, we've added over the last - during COVID, we added some non-food items that still can be carried in the car, if you will. And we're doing, I think prescriptions with them now. And so, no, it's - a good relationship and it has been for a while. Yes, I might add, though that with regard to those sales, we include that in our warehouse sales, not our e-commerce sales, because it's their employee or their employee coming into Costco to shop, purchase at the register and then take it to the customer. So that's not in our mobile e-commerce sales. As it relates to EV charging, we're testing it in a number of locations. Not a whole lot to be said. If there is a charge for it, it's going to be less Costco and we'll wait and see. And then as it relates to China, no, we just opened a few weeks ago, our fifth location. We have two more planned this fiscal year, both in the - I think one in Shenzhen in early calendar '24 and one other one before the end of August. So we'll have seven locations, up from two, a year and a half ago. And so far, our openings there have treated us well overall.\nOliver Chen: Thank you. Best regards.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good evening, guys. Can you help us understand a bit better how the Costco Next process works? I mean, is it similar to how your e-commerce business used to work, where products were essentially drop-shipped from their vendors? And if that's the case, Richard, how do you control the quality of the product and delivery process, because I thought that became an issue for you guys before you took over your own distribution for e-com?\nRichard Galanti: Yes, Costco Next is drop-shipped. We curate the items with these suppliers. And for the most part pretty well-known brands. And so far we have not had an issue on that, recognizing it's - they tend to be items that are easily shipped to home. Yes, we're doing - we have all the tracking information as well. So all I can tell you is, you're right about that, that's a good point. Years ago when we did this, there was a difference, but so far it's worked quite well for us. We've had very few customer issues as it relates to items purchased on costco.com on costconext.com.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. Understood. Thank you. And then another inflation question, if we do wind up getting outright deflation outside of improved traffic or unit block, are there ways to protect margin because it seems to me like that could wind up being a deflator to the margin, if we're in a deflationary environment there?\nRichard Galanti: Well, yes that's what our business is about, where we'll take a 10-pack and make it a 12-pack, I guess. But at the end of the day, if there's is inflation, it will impact all of us, but again. I think it should be favorable with us because we will show the best value - we'll still show the best value out there.\nScot Ciccarelli: Understood. Thank you.\nRichard Galanti: Before you do it, another comment was made in the table here, that if there is deflation and disinflation, we've got a $450 million and $500 million LIFO reserve, that'll be - on a reported basis will be part of a tailwind of disinflation.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital.\nScott Mushkin: Hi, Richard, thanks for - thanks for taking my question. I don't think we've talked about it, but what's competition like out there, now that we're seeing inflation come down in volumes, particularly for some guys are negative, just wondering if you - what it looks like out there?\nRichard Galanti: I think, look we've said this for a few years now, our competition with Sam's is the most direct and we've seen improvements in parts of what they do from our perspective. They are tough competitors and so are we, and - but I think they continue to get to improve overtime, as have we. I don't - we don't really see a whole lot of other things. BJ's is why we expect their model and what they do. It's a slightly different model. So there's not as much - there is certainly - when we are competing directly as a membership warehouse club, we're making sure we're sharp on pricing, particularly in fresh and things like that supermarket items. Beyond that, our view is on the non-food side, we are gaining share. As evidenced by the numbers we see in some of these NPD results. And the thing that I just called out on appliances grew like that. Recognizing appliances of whatever a $30 billion business, we're still a small piece of it, but growing rapidly.\nScott Mushkin: Thanks. And then, I know it came up earlier about raising membership rates, but I kind of philosophical like this recession, not recession, maybe there will be one, how does the company look at raising the membership fee, if the economy is slow and fast? Does it matter? Does it factor in?\nRichard Galanti: I think. I think it matters. It does matter and I think it really mattered as we approached kind of the 5.5 years. Post June 17th, we were in the high - the headline every day was inflation and economy. And so, we're doing great. We've got great loyalty. If we wait a little longer, so be it. And that's kind of how we feel right now. So...\nScott Mushkin: Okay, great. Thanks, I'll yield.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.\nChris Horvers: Thanks. Good evening, Richard. So your core and core margins were up a lot in this quarter. Can you talk about what drove that? I think you mentioned food and sundries, that successful vendor-funded promotions, is there anything one-time in nature about that gain that we shouldn't extrapolate forward?\nRichard Galanti: Yes, well, aside from LIFO, markdowns were lot less, quarter-on-quarter, so no markdowns. It was a big piece of it, particularly on the non-food side, that helped. Last year we had - it was a year ago that all of us including Costco, I think our inventories on a year-over-year basis were up 26% for two quarters in a row. And, of course, those will come down and so that was probably the biggest single thing in those numbers. And the comment that was made at the table here, we're back on track on seasonal in and out dates. So we're not having - a year - it was a year, year and a half ago where certain seasonal items came in late and just to move them out, not to have to store as much, some we did store, but to move them out where we felt that was the best way to do it, we take extra markdowns. So that helped.\nChris Horvers: And then a follow-up question around the consumer, you just came through the back-to-school season. There are some important electronics categories that are a big part of the basket during that time of year that also become a big part of the basket around holidays. Are you seeing, iPads and PCs and notebooks? Are you seeing positive unit trends and how does that make you feel about the upcoming holiday season?\nRichard Galanti: Gaming is up, some of the Apple products are up, TV units are up, but again, the average price points have come down some. Tablets are up and audio is up a little.\nChris Horvers: But not notebooks and computers?\nRichard Galanti: No.\nChris Horvers: Got it. Thanks.\nRichard Galanti: Let's down was the answer yet.\nChris Horvers: Understood. Thanks so much.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.\nJohn Heinbockel: So Richard, first thing, maybe just talk about how you look at cannibalization versus expanding the market in the U.S., right? And if you - obviously, you can now put - it looks like locations closer together. When you kind of look at the U.S. in total, is there a number, right, that you guys have in mind that's now possible, given what you're doing with density?\nRichard Galanti: Yes, our view is over the next 10 years that we could add easily another 150 and that's on top of however many business centers, call it, but just in the U.S. So - and that number keeps changing. If you had asked me six or eight years ago, where we'd be today, I would say, if we were 70/30 U.S. back then, we'd be 50/50 by now, outside of the - will be 50. And today, we're at 65, 70 in the U.S. So, we're finding more opportunities here and it's evidenced by just the sheer volumes of the units - that our units are doing today versus three or four years ago. It's much higher than we would have expected three or four years ago. So we think that there is still a lot of runway in that regard.\nJohn Heinbockel: And then just a quick follow-up, I know you guys haven't been particularly interested in BOPIS, right for cost reasons and I assume that's still the case. There's a consumer argument for it, but - I think it's hard to make the cost side of it work, is that still your view?\nRichard Galanti: That is still our view overall. In addition to the thing I mentioned a little bit with what we're doing with Instacart on non-food items as well. We are testing in-store some big-ticket items like TVs, but on a limited basis to see what happens for Buy Online and Pickup in Store.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our last question from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.\nJoe Feldman: Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the CPG guys, are they funding promotions a little more regularly with you guys? I know you did something, I think with P&G that seems like a clever promotion to get a gift card back from them, it seemed. And I'm just wondering what you're seeing across the other vendors?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Well the CPG, actually we did that last year as well, done it for a couple of years. We will say, we'll do it again. It's growing. So, and once we do that with one, we want to share that excitement with others to see what other types of things we can drive that way. So I'd say there's probably a little bit more increase on that type of promotional things. And then inventory is available for those things. We could really drive sales of those items in a short period of time.\nJoe Feldman: Right, that makes sense. They have the volume and you guys do. And then are you guys approaching the holiday any different this year? I know you mentioned Christmas goods are off to a good start, but is that - earlier than normal? I feel like you are about the same timing, but maybe you could share thoughts on the approach to the holiday season.\nRichard Galanti: Yes, if it's earlier, it's a week or two earlier. And some things came in early, and yes, it's a little early compared to some of the supply-chain disruptions we had, which screwed up a lot of things. But if you go back to where we were before COVID, we're probably at or very slightly earlier. And in terms of how we're approaching it? We're approaching it aggressively in terms of having stuff to sell to the members. But we want to be - we want to be out to. Typically this is nothing different here, even on things like toys will bring in a few things in the last couple of weeks before Christmas, that if they don't sell through, we're not at risk of having to mark them down dramatically because they're not unique just to Christmas.\nJoe Feldman: Understood. No, that's great. Thanks, guys and good luck this quarter, Richard.\nRichard Galanti: Well, thank you, everyone. We're around to answer questions. And have a good holiday and we'll talk to you soon.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Galanti",
            "content": "Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the Company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, the 17 weeks ended September 3. These results and the figures presented today compare to last fiscal year's 16-week fourth quarter. Reported net income for the 17-week fourth quarter came in at $2.16 billion or $4.86 per diluted share, compared to $1.868 billion or $4.20 per diluted share in the 16-week fourth quarter last year. In terms of sales, net sales for the 17-week fourth quarter were $77.43 billion, an increase of 9.4% from $70.76 billion in the 16-week fourth quarter last year. Comparable sales for the fourth quarter, and these figures are like-for-like number of weeks. In the U.S., reported was 0.2% comp. Excluding gas deflation and FX in the U.S., it would have been 3.1%. Canada, reported was 1.8%, and excluding gas deflation and FX, 7.4%. Other International reported 5.5%, and again excluding gas deflation and FX, 4.4%. Also total Company reported 1.1% comp and 3.8% ex-gas deflation and FX. In terms of e-commerce, that came in at minus 0.8% reported and minus 0.6% excluding FX. Overall for the fiscal fourth quarter, food and sundries were relatively strong once again, with fresh foods right behind and with some offsets on some of the non-foods categories. In terms of Q4 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 5.2% worldwide and 5.0% in the United States. Our average transaction or ticket was down 3.9% worldwide and down 4.5% in the U.S., impacted in large part from weakness in bigger ticket non-foods discretionary items, as well as the gas price deflation. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 0.3%, and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 2.5%. Next on the income statement, membership fee income reported in the fourth quarter $1.509 billion or 1.95% of sales in the fourth quarter this fiscal year, compared to $1.327 billion or 1.88% in Q4 of last year, so $182 million increase or 13.7%. If you adjust for the extra week, the 13.7% would be roughly 7%, ex that extra week. Excluding FX and the extra week, the increase would have been around 7.5%. In terms of renewal rates at Q4 end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rates stood at 92.7%, which is up 0.1% from the 92.6% figure as of the end of Q3. The worldwide rate came in at 90.4%, down 0.1%, reflecting the impact of increasing penetration of memberships from international, which renew at a lower rate, in large part because of new openings internationally. Our membership growth continues. We ended the fourth quarter with 71.0 million paid household members, up 7.9% versus a year ago, and 127.9 million cardholders, up 7.6%. That's on the new openings over the past year of - just under 3% increase in new locations. At the fourth quarter end, we had 32.3 million paid executive memberships, an increase of 981,000 during the 17 weeks since Q3 end. The executive members now represent a little over 45% of our paid membership and approximately - paid members and approximately 73% of worldwide sales. Moving down the income statement, next is our gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter came in higher - came in at 10.60%, up 42 basis points from 10.18% a year ago, and that 42 basis points is up 16 basis points excluding gas deflation. As I always ask you to jot down a few numbers with two columns, both reported and excluding gas deflation, the first line item would be core merchandise, on a reported basis, up 51 basis points year-over-year in the fourth quarter and ex gas deflation up 28 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses, minus 32 basis points and minus 38 basis points. 2% reward, minus 4 basis points and minus 2 basis points. LIFO, plus 27 basis points and plus 28 basis points. And if you total that up, on a reported basis, gross margin was up 42 basis points year-over-year and ex gas deflation, up 16 basis points. Starting with the core, again, up 51 basis points year-over-year, and ex deflation, up 28 basis points. In terms of core margin on their own sales, our core-on-core margins were higher by 35 basis points, with food and sundries and non-foods being up and fresh foods being down a little. Ancillary and other business gross margin was lower by 32 basis points, and lower by 38 basis points ex gas. This decrease was driven almost entirely by gas due to the other components of ancillary and other, which would include pharmacy, e-comm, food court, business centers, optical, all those things on a relative basis year-over-year were in a couple of basis points plus or minus from a year earlier. 2% reward higher by 4 basis points and higher by 2 basis points, so a negative 2 basis points including gas deflation. That represents higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. And LIFO, of course, if you recall, last year in Q4, we had a $223 million pre-tax LIFO charge, while there was a small charge this year of $30 million on a year-over-year basis. Of course, that showed the basis point improvement in margin. While we continued - we've continue to see sequential improvement in year-over-year inflation. I'll talk about that a little later. We still had a small amount relative to the first day of the fiscal year, that's a small charge in Q4. A couple of final comments on margins. First, we are of - we're asked often recently about our inventory shrinkage results and whether it has dramatically increased in the past year versus historical shrink results. The answer is, no. In the past several years, our inventory shrink has increased by a couple of basis points, in part we believe due to the rollout of self-checkout. Over the past year, it has increased by less than 1 basis point more. So no, thankfully, not a big issue for us. And second, the year-over-year margin improvement has in part been due to fewer markdowns due to better inventory positions this year than last. Our inventories overall are in good shape. Moving onto SG&A, our reported SG&A in the fourth quarter 8.96%, up from 8.53% a year earlier or up 43 basis points, and ex gas deflation up 21 basis points. Again jot down the two columns of numbers, both reported and excluding gas deflation. Operations, minus 37 basis points, minus being higher by and without deflation, core would be minus 18 basis points. Central, minus 6 basis points and minus 3 basis points. And those are the really only two line items. The others were all zero; stock compensation, preopening and other. So, total reported margins were up 43 basis points year-over-year, and ex gas deflation, up 21 basis points. In terms of the core operations being higher by 18 basis points ex gas deflation and on a reported basis higher by 37 basis points, this negative included the impact of lower sales growth as well as the impact of eight weeks of additional top-of-scale wage increases that went into effect July 4 of '22, so midway through Q4 last year, and full 17 weeks of this past March's higher-than-normal top-of-scale increase. Central being higher by 3 basis points ex gas deflation, again not a lot of sales operating leverage there. And again, as I mentioned, the other line items that I typically read out were flat, both with and without gas deflation, so zero year-over-year change. Below the operating income line, interest expense came in at $56 million this year versus $48 million a year ago, one extra week, of course. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $171 million year-over-year, $238 million this year versus $67 million last year. This was driven in large part by an increase in interest income due to both higher interest rates and higher cash balances, as well as the extra week. In addition, FX was slightly favorable year-over-year. In terms of income tax rate, our tax rate this year in the fourth quarter came in at 27.1% compared to 25.4% in Q4 last year, so full 1.7 percentage points higher year-over-year. This increase in our rate as of Q4 is primarily attributable to an increased penetration of international earnings, which overall incurs a higher income tax rate than in the U.S. Overall, reported net income was up 16% year-over-year in the quarter, or 9% if you adjust for the extra week this year quarter - this year in the fourth quarter versus last. A few other items of note, in the fourth quarter, we opened nine net new warehouses, including five new buildings in the U.S., two in China, and one each in Japan and Australia. For the full fiscal '23 year, we finished with 23 net new units, as well as we did three relocations. And for the first quarter, the first 12 weeks of fiscal '24, we plan on opening 10 net new units, as well relocating one unit. All 10 locations net new are in - nine are in the U.S. and one is in Canada. Regarding capital expenditures, we've actually included the cash flow in the quarterly report, but CapEx spend in Q4 was approximately $1.56 billion, and for all of fiscal '23, totaled $4.32 billion. Turning to e-commerce, e-commerce sales in the fourth quarter ex FX, as I mentioned, decreased 0.6% year-over-year. While still negative, relatively speaking, our e-commerce showed good improvement. Results showed good improvement this quarter versus our year-over-year results in Q2 and Q3. In the previous two fiscal quarters, big ticket discretionary majors, home furnishings, small electrics, jewelry and hardware, were down 15% and 20% year-over-year, respectively, and down just 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, with those big ticket departments making up over half of our e-commerce sales. A couple of other items to note. Within the sales of big ticket discretionary, appliance were up over 30% in the quarter. Second, I've gotten a couple of calls that people have seen online that we've been selling gold - 1-ounce gold bars. Yes, but when we load them on the site, they're typically gone within a few hours and we limit two per member. And lastly, I'll point out Costco Next. We continue to grow that. We currently have 62 suppliers on costconext.com, and we're continuing to onboard additional ones in many product areas, from home improvement to apparel, to pet, to home and kitchen, to electronics and accessories, to sports and bicycles and toys and the like. Now, a few comments on e-com mobile digital efforts, which we're always asked about. As I discussed during the last quarter earnings call, when I said that we were in the early innings of our digital mobile transformation efforts, progress is being made. In terms of recent additions and upgrades, we've recently redesigned the account page and the digital membership card. We also redesigned the header with larger search bar and expanded selling space. We've added an app box for messages and advertisements right in the app. We've recently, a few months ago, opened an optical digital store where you can virtually try on glasses and then order them for pickup, prescription glasses. And lastly, there are ongoing improvement in our Costco app, offering in-warehouse shopping tools for our customers such as a digital membership card, managing shopping lists, viewing warehouse savings, seeing the gas prices to the extent there's gas station there, and so you'll be able to search warehouse inventory and scan barcodes from the app. With the improvements made thus far over the past year, our app store rating has gone from a dismal 2.3 stars to currently 4.7 stars. Unique visitors in the site are up 40% year-over-year and the Costco app installs are up 46% year-over-year. So all in all, progress is being made. Lastly, a couple of comments regarding inflation, most recently in Q3 '23, we had estimated that year-over-year inflation was in the 3% to 4% range. Our estimate for Q4, inflation in the 1% to 2% range, and it's actually trended downward during the quarter. So hopefully, these inflation trends will continue. We'll have to see. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, October 1, on Wednesday, October 4, after the market closes. With that, I will open it up for Q&A and turn it back over to Lisa. Thank you. Good. Well. My pat answer, of course, is a question of when, not if. It's a little longer this time around, since June of '17. So we're six years into it and - but you'll see it happen at some point. We can't really tell you, if it's in our plans or not. We'll let you know when we know. We feel good. These say about all the attributes of member loyalty and member growth. And frankly, in terms of looking at the values that we provide our members, we continue to increase those. It's certainly a greater amount than even more than if and when an increase occurs. So stay tuned. We'll keep you posted, but there's not a whole lot I can tell you about that. No, I mean, you look at the numbers over the last few months that we report monthly and quarterly. There has not been a heck of a lot change. Big ticket discretionary, while improved relatively as I mentioned online - those online items, we have seen the number of items in the basket tick up a little in the last few months, but I think that has more to do with the fact that we consciously added. I had mentioned in the last call, we've consciously added 40 or 50, what I'll call smaller ticket indulgent items, whether it's snack items and the like, just impulse items. And so that's what we do as merchants, but overall we haven't seen any big change. We've been able to correlate any big change to what's happened with gas prices. Well, first of all, your comment that there was 1% to 2%, but then as we looked at the 17 weeks if you are the four months roughly, we saw - if we look at it internally at each of the end of those four months, we saw the level that 1% to 2% is from the beginning to the end of the year - I'm sorry, the beginning at the end of the quarter. But during the quarter, we saw that trending downward, if you will, a little. And when I talk to the merchants on the fresh side, it's flat-to-down a little right now on the food and sundries side, it's up a little, primarily in some of the CPG stuff and on big-ticket - not big-ticket, but our non-foods partly because of freight, which is down year-over-year in a nice way. And in some cases, some of the commodity costs on steel and the like that has come down. So that being said, we're not a big change, but at least it's trending that way. Who knows what tomorrow brings. And as it relates to - well, as I say, as it relates to us, we're always pushing prices as fast as we can. We want to be the first to lower them when those things happen and drive sales. I think we've seen that with - I think we've seen that with our traffic. Well, first of all, I want to correct one thing that it maybe I misstated or you misunderstood. In terms of fresh, fresh is pretty much flat. Food and sundries, which has everything from sundries and package goods and CPG goods that tends to be up a little bit. And I'd like to think that we're pushing the envelope as much as we can with our suppliers that has certain freight costs have come down. Recognizing the headline today in the paper is - oil is approaching $100 a barrel. So, who the heck knows what happens tomorrow. Well, I think we've seen that over the last year, frankly. We had such operating leverage over a couple of years when we had outside sales during the kind of two years of COVID, call the spring of '20 to spring of 2022. And, it was before COVID, when our SG&A was over 10% - slightly over 10%, and we said, would it ever be able to get below that, it's now still below 9%. So, notwithstanding the fact, when I looked at the last several quarters on a year-over-year basis, again, particularly over the last couple of quarters, we've seen some deleverage of that. Look, we want to drive sales and we'll do that in the best ways we can. So - but we recognize when we used to get the question all the time, what comp number do you need to have zero, negative or positive leverage with SG&A, recognizing there was low - very little inflation back then. We used to say somewhere, who knows, but somewhere in the 4.5% to 5% range. So we don't know exactly where it is, but we're certainly not going to change the level of service that we have and we're certainly - you're going to respect our employees in terms of what we've done with wage increases overtime. That's what we do. Well, yes, I remember when we talked to a few quarters ago about some of the slowness in big-ticket discretionary, well, we got harder on price. It did a little bit, but not as much as we would have thought to start with. But again, that perhaps was the impact of what's going on with the concerns of the economy and everything else. We know that when we put hard buys and what we call TPDs, temporary price discounts on items, even medium-sized ticket items, we do see - we do leverage - see the units increase, but it's not as predictable I would say as it used to be. It's a little easier on the food side to see that sometimes more, when taking the price of meat item down. Sure. And by - even a big-ticket, when we see $300 and $400 price declines because of freight and raw material cost on some big-ticket non-food items, we'll see some of the sales pick back up on that. But, there's nothing guaranteed. No not really. I mean, LIFO is certainly one that was impacted over the last year and started to slow down. Assuming that trend continues, there won't be much LIFO going forward for right now what we see. Beyond that, no, we're still opening. We opened 23 net new units this past year. We're on board to do something in the mid-to-high 20s this year. But that's not enough to move the needle in terms of the leverage standpoint or anything. No, I'd say it's steady as she goes. And if anything I look to be the margins overall, given everything that's going on, including competition that we're doing pretty well there. We - with some of the wage hikes that we continue to do and sales being a little weaker than they had been a year ago, I think we're doing pretty well on that as well. We're optimistic about our future, but we'll see what happens. Yes, well, I think it was on things like gas was one, and then in some of the fresh food items there was - even though there was deflation in things like eggs and some dairy products, there was - there were some inflationary trends and beef. Beyond that, do you have that handy. Yes, it's really small, but on $16 billion of inventory, it's a lot. I mean, it's still a small number of $30 million and that, but - that's all. I don't have the details on that. I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but generally speaking, in Asia, whether it's Korea, Taiwan, Japan or China, we'll open a new unit including the 10 or 12 weeks of sign-ups prior to opening, with anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 new members. We had a couple of extremes like when we first opened in Shanghai Minhang of well over 200. Now, some of that looky-loos that don't renew and we usually in that first year of renewal and those types of outsized numbers, we might be as low as the mid-to-high 50s and it takes a few years to get even to the mid-70s. But we see those numbers overall continue to increase every year and I don't - I can't - I don't - I actually probably go back to what it was in the first 10 years of our 40-year history with even the U.S. My guess, it wasn't that extreme, but we didn't have as many - it wasn't national and local news events, the day we opened. We had a lot of people coming into some of these markets that are signing up that may be live too far away or choose not to come back. So we're seeing that continuing to grow. So by - even as simple - that's slight 0.1% decline, it's round the year in the sense that you opened up a couple of more units a year ago, they've just renewing for the first time that increases that number. 70% plus in the U.S. and Canada, mostly U.S., of course. Which in my view is we're finding more openings - more opportunities in the U.S. to in-fill, given our high volumes. And we got plenty going on over the years, overseas. Thank you. Right, well, look, first of all, first and foremost, our traffic continues to do very well. Being up continually 4% to 5% on a year-over-year basis is great. And our renewal rates continue to be very strong. So that's the starting point. It makes sense to us on big-ticket discretionary that's where you'd see the biggest weakness. We see some of that in some areas going back. When we look at our numbers compared to MBD, that tells us where we are versus our competitors. Overall, not in every category, but overall we tend to do better. So even a negative number here is a lower negative number elsewhere. So - and again, what do we do, we brought in some smaller ticket items that are impulse snack items to get an extra partial item in everybody's basket. So, yes and newness, bringing those new items. And there's not been a whole lot in television. Our unit sales and TVs are pretty good, but the average price point has come down, as they do anyway, there's always deflationary. When you don't have new technology yet and that's just, we haven't seen a whole lot of new stuff yet there. Gaming is good right now and Christmas is good. I mean, we're one of the - not the only one, but one of the few that are bringing in seasonal items early, everything from decor to trees, to toys, that's starting off well so far. But it's new, it's in the last few weeks. I'm sorry, what else did you ask? Well, part of that is some of the things we're doing with digital and mobile and the app. And we're not giving out quantifiable numbers, but certainly, some of our competitors are talking about doubling these numbers in the next two or three years. In my view, there is some low-hanging fruit out there and we're actively working on it. We've hired a couple of people that are helping us with that as well and more to come. Well. First of all, we've always prided ourselves in providing the best hourly wage package out there, wages, benefits, contributions to 401(k). I'm using U.S. numbers here, but our average U.S. - 90% of our employees like many big retailers are hourly. And our average hourly wage is approaching $26 is in the high-$25s. That's on top of a very rich healthcare plan, where the employee only pays around 11% or 12% of it I believe. And on top, little less than that - and on-top of that, irrespective of what employee contributes to his or her 401(k), we contribute anywhere from 3% to 9% based on years of service. So you've got a 20-year cashier making on a full-time basis in the mid-60s with another $4,000 or $5,000 being contributed to his or her 401(k) plan with a very rich healthcare plan. So we stand apart in our view compared to anybody. Our pressure is that, it comes from ourselves. In the last few years, as there have been wage pressure, starting with the frontline workers during the beginning of COVID, we like many retailers added a 2% premium - $2 premium rather. We kept it longer to our knowledge than most anybody for a full year and at the end, we kept a dollar in there. And since then we've had at least three or four increases on top of the normal top-of-scale increase that we do every - generally have done every year - we have done every year. So we'll - in our view, the pressure comes from us and we feel that we're way ahead of our competition in that regard. I don't think we're prepared for Scan and Go, yet. We're just going to scan, but they can't go. So at the end of the day, the first order of business is getting the merchandise on there and haven't had numbers that where a member, he goes online to say, hey, you can also get this currently at your local location. So knowing what's in store when somebody wants to come out, I think that's going to be a big positive to start with and part of the scan is to be able to get more product information on the item as well. Well, we don't give specific numbers. Gas has been stronger for us and we believe all retailers in the last few years. In fact, it was Q4 last year, which I think it was our strongest quarter, recognizing it's 16-week quarter. This fourth quarter, it was still strong, down from its strongest a year earlier on a weekly basis, but nonetheless quite strong. And so it's part of the profit picture currently of all big retailers that sell gas, the supermarkets, the Walmarts and the Costcos of the world. So it's still a profitable business. It's - our view has been, you used to be when prices - given that the return it so fast, literally almost daily, when profits are going up - I'm sorry, when the price of gas is going up, the guy down the street is turning it every eight or nine days is paying a little less four days ago. And so we're making it the less, when sales went down - gallons - the price per gallon went down, we made a little more. I think that equation, while it's still true, is not the driver of the bottom line of gas. Everybody seems to be wanting to make more on gas, which allows us in our view to make a little more and still be even more profitable. We've seen our competitive spread versus our direct competitors at every location on average improve over the last couple of years to now be in the - I want to say to 30-set range per gallon, mid-30s is the average, which is up. It's an average and it can range from 10 to 45. But at the end of the day, we feel good about our competitive position, it's increased and we're still quite profitable down a little bit from a year ago, but nonetheless quite profitable. Well, I think, look, at the end of day, we've done four special dividends in the past. It's part of our DNA. At some point, we may do that again. Again somewhat like the answer to the other question about membership fees, it's probably a question of when, not if, but we'll let you know. Certainly with earning 5%-ish on that money instead of a clear percent-ish on that money, does make it a little harder to do. But we're not selling the kind of earnings multiple, but we earn 5% on our assets. So, at some point, we'll do something and we'll have to wait and see. I was joking you're going to say, first of all, they are very smart to be an executive member. Look, I think we are over the time, we've done a better job of communicating the value of the executive member. So, we clearly get more people to sign up that way in advance and we see that over time a regular member over the first few years will buy more every year and executive members start at a higher level and will buy more every year from that higher level. So that's really the profile that we've seen. I don't have any specifics on how old the member is. I know that when we look at age characteristics of new members, we're still - everybody used to be concerned 10 years ago, how we going to get millennials when we have an older average customer and all that and we did with things, with items, with things like organic. We're doing the same thing now. We're still getting whether it's Gen Z or Gen A or whatever the next is, we're getting our share of those new members when we look at the profile of our members. No, it's - I mean, the simple math would just say it's 16, 17 of our quarter is equal to a 16-week quarter. That's about as good as we can do. I think that particularly on net income it takes the 16% or whatever percent number down to 9% or something, and that's just simple math. Sure. Inventories, as I mentioned, we feel - the merchants feel very good about our inventory levels right now. Are there a few departments are higher than they want, a few that need a little bit more sure. But overall, they're very good. Look at our fiscal year and inventories stood at just under $16.7 billion and payables stood at $17.5 billion. So I think this - running above 100% on that simple ratio is something new. We used to be - we used to enjoy running 90% to 95%, it fluctuates, but overall, we feel good about our inventories, where they are now. And in terms of supply chain, things coming in on time, we feel good about that as well. Now as it relates to - as we, excuse me, as we anniversary the inflection of when we saw some weakness, I think a couple of quarters ago, I mentioned that will help your big-ticket sales, I said, well, at least in a few several more months we'll anniversary this weakness. So certainly that's going to help. I would like to think that not just that thing that's going to help, but - and the same would be commerce. I mean, we're - again one bright spot in this virtually all e-commerce, not nearly always - is nearly always e-commerce was the appliances that - and I think we've done a better job also of showing the value of these items online, not just the price the item within our case includes delivery and warranty and things like that more so than some of our competitors. And showing great value there. Okay. Yes. I had the second and third, what was the first question? Oh, Instacart, I know they just went public. So we've gotten a lot of questions. At the end of the day, we were good partner with them, they were good partner for us. We used them throughout the U.S. and Canada. And as sales are growing, we've added over the last - during COVID, we added some non-food items that still can be carried in the car, if you will. And we're doing, I think prescriptions with them now. And so, no, it's - a good relationship and it has been for a while. Yes, I might add, though that with regard to those sales, we include that in our warehouse sales, not our e-commerce sales, because it's their employee or their employee coming into Costco to shop, purchase at the register and then take it to the customer. So that's not in our mobile e-commerce sales. As it relates to EV charging, we're testing it in a number of locations. Not a whole lot to be said. If there is a charge for it, it's going to be less Costco and we'll wait and see. And then as it relates to China, no, we just opened a few weeks ago, our fifth location. We have two more planned this fiscal year, both in the - I think one in Shenzhen in early calendar '24 and one other one before the end of August. So we'll have seven locations, up from two, a year and a half ago. And so far, our openings there have treated us well overall. Yes, Costco Next is drop-shipped. We curate the items with these suppliers. And for the most part pretty well-known brands. And so far we have not had an issue on that, recognizing it's - they tend to be items that are easily shipped to home. Yes, we're doing - we have all the tracking information as well. So all I can tell you is, you're right about that, that's a good point. Years ago when we did this, there was a difference, but so far it's worked quite well for us. We've had very few customer issues as it relates to items purchased on costco.com on costconext.com. Well, yes that's what our business is about, where we'll take a 10-pack and make it a 12-pack, I guess. But at the end of the day, if there's is inflation, it will impact all of us, but again. I think it should be favorable with us because we will show the best value - we'll still show the best value out there. Before you do it, another comment was made in the table here, that if there is deflation and disinflation, we've got a $450 million and $500 million LIFO reserve, that'll be - on a reported basis will be part of a tailwind of disinflation. I think, look we've said this for a few years now, our competition with Sam's is the most direct and we've seen improvements in parts of what they do from our perspective. They are tough competitors and so are we, and - but I think they continue to get to improve overtime, as have we. I don't - we don't really see a whole lot of other things. BJ's is why we expect their model and what they do. It's a slightly different model. So there's not as much - there is certainly - when we are competing directly as a membership warehouse club, we're making sure we're sharp on pricing, particularly in fresh and things like that supermarket items. Beyond that, our view is on the non-food side, we are gaining share. As evidenced by the numbers we see in some of these NPD results. And the thing that I just called out on appliances grew like that. Recognizing appliances of whatever a $30 billion business, we're still a small piece of it, but growing rapidly. I think. I think it matters. It does matter and I think it really mattered as we approached kind of the 5.5 years. Post June 17th, we were in the high - the headline every day was inflation and economy. And so, we're doing great. We've got great loyalty. If we wait a little longer, so be it. And that's kind of how we feel right now. So... Yes, well, aside from LIFO, markdowns were lot less, quarter-on-quarter, so no markdowns. It was a big piece of it, particularly on the non-food side, that helped. Last year we had - it was a year ago that all of us including Costco, I think our inventories on a year-over-year basis were up 26% for two quarters in a row. And, of course, those will come down and so that was probably the biggest single thing in those numbers. And the comment that was made at the table here, we're back on track on seasonal in and out dates. So we're not having - a year - it was a year, year and a half ago where certain seasonal items came in late and just to move them out, not to have to store as much, some we did store, but to move them out where we felt that was the best way to do it, we take extra markdowns. So that helped. Gaming is up, some of the Apple products are up, TV units are up, but again, the average price points have come down some. Tablets are up and audio is up a little. No. Let's down was the answer yet. Yes, our view is over the next 10 years that we could add easily another 150 and that's on top of however many business centers, call it, but just in the U.S. So - and that number keeps changing. If you had asked me six or eight years ago, where we'd be today, I would say, if we were 70/30 U.S. back then, we'd be 50/50 by now, outside of the - will be 50. And today, we're at 65, 70 in the U.S. So, we're finding more opportunities here and it's evidenced by just the sheer volumes of the units - that our units are doing today versus three or four years ago. It's much higher than we would have expected three or four years ago. So we think that there is still a lot of runway in that regard. That is still our view overall. In addition to the thing I mentioned a little bit with what we're doing with Instacart on non-food items as well. We are testing in-store some big-ticket items like TVs, but on a limited basis to see what happens for Buy Online and Pickup in Store. Yes. Well the CPG, actually we did that last year as well, done it for a couple of years. We will say, we'll do it again. It's growing. So, and once we do that with one, we want to share that excitement with others to see what other types of things we can drive that way. So I'd say there's probably a little bit more increase on that type of promotional things. And then inventory is available for those things. We could really drive sales of those items in a short period of time. Yes, if it's earlier, it's a week or two earlier. And some things came in early, and yes, it's a little early compared to some of the supply-chain disruptions we had, which screwed up a lot of things. But if you go back to where we were before COVID, we're probably at or very slightly earlier. And in terms of how we're approaching it? We're approaching it aggressively in terms of having stuff to sell to the members. But we want to be - we want to be out to. Typically this is nothing different here, even on things like toys will bring in a few things in the last couple of weeks before Christmas, that if they don't sell through, we're not at risk of having to mark them down dramatically because they're not unique just to Christmas. Well, thank you, everyone. We're around to answer questions. And have a good holiday and we'll talk to you soon."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Costco Wholesale Corporation's fiscal Q3 2023 conference call. [Operator instructions] Thank you. Richard Galanti, CFO, you may begin your conference.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you, Josh, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the 12 weeks ended this past May 7. Reported net income for the quarter was $1.30 billion or $2.93 per diluted share. This compared to $1.35 billion or $3.04 per diluted share a year ago in the third quarter. This year's results included a nonrecurring charge to merchandise costs of $298 million pre-tax or $0.50 per share, primarily for the discontinuation of our charter shipping activities. Last year's results included a nonrecurring $77 million pre-tax charge or $0.13 per share for incremental employee benefits. As many of you know, two years ago, we initially leased three ships and thousands of containers to help mitigate some of the significant overseas freight challenges that we were experiencing. Later, we added four additional vessels and several thousand additional containers with commitments made for up to then three additional years. Procuring these ships and containers was integral to us being able to stay in stock for our members during those challenging times. It also allowed us to do so initially at a lower cost than the market rates at that time. Shipping and freight markets have improved dramatically since that time, which led us to reevaluate our position. As you recall, in the first quarter of this fiscal year, we took a charge to downsize by two vessels our charter shipping activities. Since then, shipping and container rates have continued to fall. And in the third quarter, this third quarter, we concluded that it would be appropriate to completely discontinue the remainder of our charter shipping activities. As a result of this decision, we recorded an impairment charge for all remaining charter assets. This decision allows our merchandising teams to take full advantage of the current shipping market rates as opposed to much higher contracted charter rates. In turn, this allows us to do what we do best and lower prices for our members. In terms of sales. Net sales for the third quarter increased 1.9% to $52.6 billion versus $51.61 billion reported last year in the third quarter. Comparable sales for the quarter were as follows: in the U.S., on a reported basis, minus 0.1%, and excluding gas deflation and FX, plus 1.8%; Canada, reported, minus 1%, ex gas and FX, plus 7.4%; and Other International, reported, plus 4.1%, and ex gas and FX, plus 8.4%. So total company, on a reported basis, 0.3% comp sales, and ex gas deflation and FX at plus 3.5%. And our e-commerce on a reported basis was minus 10% and minus 9%, excluding FX. In terms of third quarter comp sales metrics. Traffic or shopping frequency remains pretty good, increasing 4.8% worldwide and 3.5% in the U.S. during the quarter. Our average daily transaction or ticket was down 4.2% worldwide and down 3.5% in the U.S., impacted, in large part, from weakness in bigger-ticket nonfood discretionary items. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 1.5%, and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 1.7%. Next on the income statement is membership fee income. For the quarter, we reported $1.044 billion of membership fee income or 1.98% of sales compared to $984 million or 1.91% a year ago in the third quarter, so a $60 million or 6.1% increase in membership fees. Excluding the headwinds in FX, the $60 million increase would have been higher by $17 million or up year over year 8%, adjusted for FX. In terms of renewal rates, at third quarter end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate was 92.6%, and our worldwide rate came in at 90.5%. These figures are the same all-time high renewal rates that were achieved in the second quarter, just 12 weeks ago here. Membership growth continues. We ended Q3 with 69.1 paid household members and 124.7 million cardholders, both up approximately 7% versus a year ago. At third quarter end, we had 31.3 million paid executive members, an increase of 681,000 or 57,000 per week during the 12-week fiscal third quarter. Executive members now represent a little over 45% of our paid members and approximately 73% of worldwide sales. Moving down the income statement. Next is our gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the third quarter was higher year over year on a reported basis by 13 basis points, coming in at 10.32% as compared to a 10.19% number a year earlier. The 13 basis point positive ex gas deflation was minus 3 basis points. Both of these numbers, of course, includes a little more than 50 basis point impairment charge to margin mentioned in today's earnings release. As I normally do, I'll ask you to jot down a few numbers, two columns: a reported column and then column excluding gas deflation. The first item would be, for the third quarter of '23, core merchandise margin. On a reported basis, it was up year over year 39 basis points and ex gas deflation, up 24; ancillary and other, plus 13 and plus nine; 2% Reward, minus 11 and minus nine; LIFO, plus 25 and plus 25; and other, minus 53 and minus 52. If you add up the two columns, again, you get to the reported number of, on a reported basis, gross margin year over year in the quarter was up 13 basis points, and ex gas deflation, down 3 basis points. So starting over the core. Again, core was up, on a reported basis, 39 basis points year over year and 24 ex gas deflation. In terms of core margins on their own core sales, or core-on-core margins, they were higher by 17 basis points, with food and sundries and nonfoods being up and fresh foods being down a little. Ancillary and other businesses gross margin was higher by 13 and again higher by nine ex gas deflation. Within the ancillary businesses, gasoline, business centers, food court and travel were better year over year, offset in part by e-com. 2% Reward, again, higher by 11 basis points and higher by nine ex gas deflation. Higher sales penetration coming from our executive members is certainly part of that. LIFO, plus 25 basis points year over year, both with and without gas deflation. As you recall, a year ago, in the third quarter, we had $130 million charge for LIFO. In this fiscal year, we had no LIFO charge. So $130 million year-over-year improvement on that line item. Note also that in the fourth quarter a year ago, we had a $223 million LIFO charge. So we'll see how that goes in the fourth quarter this year. Other was lower by 53 basis points reported and 52 ex gas deflation. This was net of items for both years. This year, there was a 57 basis point negative impact from the $298 million pre-tax charge, again, primarily related to terminating our charter shipping activities. This was partially offset by lapping last year's $77 million charge for incremental employee benefits, of which $20 million or 4 basis points related to gross margin. The remaining $57 million, I'll talk about it in a minute under SG&A. Moving on to SG&A. Our reported SG&A this year was nine.11% compared to 8.62% a year ago. So on a reported basis, higher by 49 basis points, and ex gas deflation, higher by 34%. As with gross margin, I'll ask you to jot down two columns of numbers, both reported and one excluding gas deflation. First item is operations, higher by 48 basis points and minus 35 basis points; central, minus 11 and minus nine; stock compensation, zero in both columns; preopening, minus one and minus one; other, plus 11 and plus 11. If you add all those up, again, on a reported basis, 49 basis points higher year over year, and ex gas deflation, 34. Now, to core operations. This negative included, of course, the impact of slower sales growth, as well as the impact of a few of the wage increases that we did that are typically out of the normal cycle over the last year -- over a year. And that included the impact of four weeks of wage and benefits increases implemented last March, the additional top-of-scale increase that went into effect July 4, and eight weeks of this March is higher than normal top-of-scale increase. Despite the slowing sales growth, we've continued to invest in our employees over the past year, and that's always been a priority for us. Central, higher by 11 and higher by nine ex gas deflation. Again, sales growth -- there's no big single item that was an outlier there. But sales growth overall, in my view, was the impact. Stock comp, flat both with and without gas deflation, so no impact there. Preopening again, higher by 1 basis point. We had five openings this year in the quarter and three last year but, again, 1 basis point delta year over year. And Other, 11 basis point positive, both with and without gas deflation. This is a result of lapping that $77 million charge, within SG&A, lapping $57 million of that $77 million charge for the incremental employee benefits, again, discussed earlier in the release. Below the operating income line, interest expense came in at $36 million, $1 million over last year's $35 million number. And interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $57 million year over year. This was driven by an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates and cash balances. And an increase in interest income was partially offset by less favorable FX versus last year. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the third quarter came in at 26.5%. That compared to 24.9% in Q3 last year. The fiscal '23 effective rate, excluding discrete items, is currently projected to be in the 26% to 27% range. Overall, reported net income was down year over year by 4 percentage points, net of the two nonrecurring items in both years' third quarters. Net income would have been up 8% even being reflected with that higher income tax rate. In terms of warehouse expansion, to date, we've opened 17 locations in the first three quarters and also including three relocations, so net of that, 14 net new locations. In Q4, we have nine new openings with no relos, so net of nine. That will put us at 26 openings, less the three relos, to be a 23 net new for this year. In the quarter, again, we opened five, with four being net new. In addition to the relocation in Canada, we had two new buildings in the U.S. opened, and one additional building opened in each of Japan and China. Again, of the nine new buildings planned for our fiscal fourth quarter, that includes our North Tulsa, Oklahoma opening that opened this morning, and our fourth and fifth buildings in China planned for June and August. These Q4 planned openings will bring our full year account to 26 less the three, or net of 23, and that is made up of 13 in the U.S. and 10 outside of the U.S.\u00a0 Regarding capital expenditures. In Q3 of the fiscal year, we spent approximately $819 million. Our estimate for all of fiscal '23, capex is approximately $4 billion. Moving on to e-commerce. You saw in the release that e-commerce was a minus 10% sales decline on a comp basis and ex FX, minus 9%. E-com sales, more to the same story in terms of the sales, as I discussed on our second quarter call and in our monthly sales recordings. In Q3, big-ticket discretionary departments, notably majors, home furnishings, small electrics, jewelry and hardware, were down about 20% in e-com and made up 55% of e-com sales. These same departments were down about 17% in warehouse, but they only make up 8% in warehouse sales. A few comments on inflation. Inflation continues to abate somewhat. If you go back a year ago to the fourth quarter of '22 last summer, we had estimated that year over year inflation at the time was up 8%. And by Q1 and Q2, it was down to 6% and 7% and then 5% and 6%. In this quarter, we're estimating the year over year inflation in the 3% to 4% range. We continue to see improvements in many items, notably food items like nuts, eggs and meat, as well as items that include, as part of their components, commodities like steel and resins on the nonfood side. Switching over to inventory levels. Inventories overall are in pretty good shape. As of quarter end, our inventories year over year as of the end of the third quarter were down 7%. Recall that they had been up during some of the supply chain challenges of last year. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results for the four weeks ending Sunday, May 28, next Thursday on June 1, after market close. And also remember that our fiscal fourth quarter has an extra week this year. So our quarter ending September 3, 2023, will have 17 weeks versus 16 weeks in the fiscal fourth quarter. With that, I'll open it up for questions and answers and turn it back over to Josh. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open.\nMichael Lasser: Good afternoon, Richard. How broadly and widely is Costco willing to roll back prices in order to drive traffic and sustain a mid-single-digit comp growth? How are you thinking about the prospect of deflation across your entire portfolio?\nRichard Galanti: Well, look, that's something that our merchants work on literally every day and every week. I remember when inflation was peaking at 8% and 9% and some out there would say -- and we're known for trying to hold the line and work with our suppliers, how much will they eat of that, how much will we eat of that. At the end of the day, if margins year over year were down 50 or 100 basis points back then, that implies that some portion of it, maybe instead of an 8% or 9% increase, our members were seeing a 6% or 7% or 8% increase. Whatever that was, we felt that we were doing as good a job as anyone out there given the item nature of our business to lower prices for our members and hopefully drive sales. Certainly, right now, we're -- we've always been a little bit, compared to others, over indexed in bigger-ticket discretionary items. That's getting hit arguably more than others. If you look at our fresh foods and food and sundries, they're in the mid- to mid-high singles. You look at the nonfoods and some of the ancillaries, notably gasoline, which is 11% year over year deflation in gas prices, that's in the mid-single negatives. So it all adds up to where it is. Every day, we look to drive sales. What will it take to get to whatever X is? Who the heck knows? I just know that our merchants and Craig and Ron and Claudine, our Head of Merchandising, are pushing the buyers each day to do that and figuring out how can we take the monies that we get, any types of monies, from the vendors that can be used to drive business. One of the reasons that it made sense for us to discontinue the containers and the shipping vessels is to reduce the cost that our buyers are seeing relative to these much higher contract rates now. We were smart for a year. And now looking back, it was good to get out of it. And that allowed us to be more competitive as well. So I feel we're doing a great job of being very competitive. When we do comp shops against our direct warehouse club competitors, as well as different components, whether it's retail food or general merchandise on the buildings, home improvement side, we feel very good about our competitive position and what we're doing to do that.\nMichael Lasser: So are you not expecting broad-based deflation, Richard? And my follow-up question is going to be, given the amount of value you give to your members, wouldn't it make sense to raise your fees right now because your renewal rates have been so high and you would be providing even more value in this difficult economic environment.\nRichard Galanti: Well, first of all, on the question of deflation, let's hope that there is. And you will be the first to see it at Costco, in my view. As it relates to membership fees, nice try, Michael. But at the end of the day, with the headline being inflation, we feel very good about if we want to do it, can we do it without impacting, in any meaningful way, renewal rates or sign-ups or anything. And at some point, we will. But our view right now is that we've got enough leverage out there to drive business, and we feel that it's incumbent upon us to be that beacon of light to our members in terms of holding them for right now. It's not a matter of a big time, but we'll let you know as soon as we know.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimeon Gutman: Hey, Richard. My first question is on the comps and the stacks. It's obviously been slowing, and you probably took more than your fair share over the last three years. Curious when you sit around how you're diagnosing it, macro, I don't know if it's gas attachment, merchandising, weather, any of those options, how do you diagnose what's happening?\nRichard Galanti: Well, first of all, we look at traffic. We're getting people in the door, and we know what they're buying. They're buying nondiscretionary items. They're buying fresh foods. They're buying food and sundries. They're buying apparel in a big way. They're buying patio furniture now that the weather has turned in a big way; indoor furniture, not as much. We all know what's going on with consumer electronics out there. While all the numbers, industrywide, are down, ours are down a little less, but they're down. So overall, when we look at what else can we do to drive more nonfood business but, at the same time, can we bring in a few more items on the food and sundry side because we know traffic is good there. It's simple impulse items that sell for $15 to $25. So that's what we do every day, and that's what Claudine and her staff and merchants are doing.\nSimeon Gutman: And then, my follow-up, can you give us some information or color on gasoline gross profit year over year, how that profit pool is trending, obviously, inclusive of both gallons and the penny profit?\nRichard Galanti: Well, yes, gallons are close to flat. The average price per gallon during the quarter was down 11%. So that's, I don't have the number, 12% or 13% of our sales, which was -- the average price point per cell unit, if you will, was down 11%. year over year, gasoline was profitable in both quarters nicely. As I've said, I'm sure I said last year, in Q3 and this year, it helped a little year over year but not a lot. Last year, in Q4, it was a strong number. And then, you got an extra week, and we'll see how it goes this year. But right now, gasoline continues to be quite profitable for us.\nSimeon Gutman: OK. Thanks, Richard.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks very much and good morning. So I just want to jump back to the pricing question. From a strategy perspective, typically, if you see things that are dis-inflating or deflating on more of the commodity side, you'll take price ahead of that. I guess is that what you're doing currently? And we've heard a lot of talk in the market about the vendors funding more promotions, how are you thinking about the balance between the retailer funding the promotion or the price investment versus the vendors?\nRichard Galanti: Well, first, look, we work with our suppliers every day and it's going to be a partnership there. Again, I think it's easier for us, on the one hand, that we do a lot of volume on a fewer items. We have buyers that literally are managing a couple of dozen items, not 200 items. And I remember, when certain commodity prices like resins and steel were going up, in our monthly budget meeting hearing from the merchants how, while we're committing out five, six months for seasonal items, like patio furniture, barbecue grills, a couple of years ago, we want to know when the vendor was increasing the price on whatever it was, whether it was a major consumer products company or some manufacturer of nonfood items like that. Why? Exactly why? How much of it's labor? How much of it's the commodity cost? And how much is transportation cost and wage pressure? Whatever. And as we saw commodities coming down, I'd like to think that we were the first ones on the phone with our suppliers wanting to know when the price is going to drop. And understandably, in some cases, the supplier had committed to a season of three or four months. And so, there was some delay, and we worked with them there. In addition, as we said, we're going to invest a little on price. How much are you willing to invest in price? So it's a partnership. And I think we are in a better position to do that simply because, if you take our $230 billion or $240 billion in sales and divide it by 3,800 SKUs, it's a lot more pricing power per SKU and a lot more focus on an item-by-item basis. So that's what we do. And as there are promotional monies out there from the suppliers, this goes back to the beginning of time around here. I remember with the traditional co-op advertising dollars, a supplier wanted you to spend $0.05 of our own money and add it to $0.05 of theirs to do $0.10 of advertising of their product. And we said, just give us the $0.05 and we'll base it on a $0.95 cost, not a dollar cost. And that's what we still do. And so, I think we have to be smart about knowing what every bucket of money is out there, whether it's promotional monies or ad monies, or ad monies online now, and work with our suppliers to do that. And in our case, also, we do what we call the MVM, the multi-vendor mailers, the coupon books that we send out 11 times a year, and not only that but hot buys in-store and what we call temporary price discounts and what can drive sales. The other part of that is, when we get monies, in some cases, how much elasticity is there in driving business by lowering their price. In some categories, particularly some of the bigger-ticket categories right now, there's not an appetite by the consumer necessarily for that. So how do we add value to the item or do more things to it to drive business? It's all of the above.\nChristopher Horvers: And so, as you look forward, you said, I think, 3% to 4% inflation in the quarter. If you look at the Nielsen data, that was sort of low double digit, right, I mean, Walmart talked about that. So a two-part question, one is, is the difference just mix that you have more fresh commodity exposure? And then, if you project forward that you'll have sort of no inflation potentially six, eight months out, so how do you think about your ability to continue to comp overall?\nRichard Galanti: Well, when there was low inflation and not an overarching concern about a recession, when the world was seen to be comping three, four, five and six years ago at 2% to 4%, we were 5% to 7%. Our view is, because we got great members buying more with great loyalty and the best prices by a major difference and quality, and so we've succeeded under those. I think right now, in my view, more of it relates to the fact that we're not only dealing with big-ticket discretionary items weakness which, again, when we look at like MPD\u00a0 and everything, we're doing better in most of those categories. Our negative is not as negative as others out there. In addition, we're comparing against two years of outsized growth in some of those things as people were buying things from their home. We saw outsized sales in indoor and outdoor furniture and electronics and TVs and exercise equipment. And so, we're not only comparing against this \"recession\" or concerns about big-ticket items but comparing against uber strength over the last two years prior to that. So I think we'll come out of this fine. We're pretty good at figuring out new items and new things to do. And we're not just focused on how do we drive sales another 1% or 2% but how can we drive sales when bringing in new and exciting stuff. And we continue to do that. And this is anecdotal, but over the last year, year and a half, we've always been very good at taking what I'll call big American cross-scale products, including a lot of KS, and having huge success overseas. We're now, on a conscious basis, figuring out what the unique, exciting overseas items can we bring elsewhere in the world, including the U.S. and Canada. And we're having good experience with some of those things. These are all small things, but there's lots of little small things around here that add up.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Ciccarelli with Truist. Your line is open.\nScott Ciccarelli: Good afternoon, guys. Richard, I think you mentioned fresh foods were a bit on the softer side. When you kind of look at the data, is that a function of your members moving to less expensive packaged goods? Or is that more just do the COVID-driven comparisons like you were just talking about on the discretionary side?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. By the way, when I was talking earlier about down, the margins were a little weaker on fresh. Sales have been fine. In the quarter, again, when you look at a reported total company sales number of 0.3%, or 3.5% ex gas and FX, but within that 0.3% reported, fresh was mid-singles, food and sundries is mid- to high singles, nonfoods was a little over mid-single negative.\nScott Ciccarelli: Got it. All right. I'm not sure I understood that. So the second question related to that, though, is are you seeing any other kind of trade, let's call it, trade-down type activity, whether it's more private label sales, etc., that you kind of identified from your members?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. And by the way, not just in this current \"recession\" or concern for recession, historically, like within fresh protein, we've always seen when there's a recession, whether it was '99 or '00 or '08, '09, '10, we would see some sales penetration shift from beef to poultry and pork. We have seen some of that now. I think anecdotally, I heard a few months ago from our Head of Food and Sundries buyer, that we saw some switch even to some canned products, like canned chicken and canned tuna and things like that. But on the KS side, we've also seen that. I think last quarter, I mentioned that on a year-over-year basis, there's a 150 basis point increase in private label sales penetration. And this year, at the end of the quarter, it's 120 basis points. So still, over a full percentage point delta in sales penetration. If you go back over the last 10 years, my guess is that on a year-over-year basis, maybe we've gone from, I'm guessing, 22% or 23% to 25% or 26%. So call it, 300 basis points over 10 years or eight years. So 30 to 50 basis points versus 120 and 150 in the last couple of quarters. So yes, that would, again, at least anecdotally, suggest that we've seen people looking for better bargains. We try to correct people when they said was it a downgrading because, arguably, it was an upgrade when they went to Kirkland Signature.\nScott Ciccarelli: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nKaren Short: Hey. Thanks very much. Good to talk to you. Two questions. One is your pre-tax margin is one of the highest that I think I've seen in the model, like I'm not even sure I could go back to when it was as high as it was. So I'm curious if you could just make some color or commentary on that. And then, the second question I had was not that we're necessarily going into a deflationary environment in food, but if we were to go into a deflationary environment in food, what would be the deleverage you would see on the EBIT line on that front?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I'd be remiss if I even can think of a number off the top of my head here. In our view, first of all, in a deflation, we'll be the first out there lowering prices with it. And I'd like to think that we could drive business with it. The other thing is look at even something like gasoline. I think all retailers out there that have gasoline operations have, in the last few years, reflected higher profitability from gas. In our view, we have higher profitability, and we have the most extreme savings versus everybody else, so we've been able to make a little more per gallon because others have decided to make more than a little more. And I think that same thing holds true elsewhere. When we look at our competitive price shops against our direct club competitors and against others on key items like fresh with supermarkets, again, those price gaps between us and our competition have not changed. They're still as strong as we feel they should be. And so, again, it's hard to say what -- your comment about some of the highest pre-tax margins, let's face it, I remember looking at even like SG&A, which was up year over year, of course. If you go back pre-COVID, I think our SG&A on a reported basis had a 10 in front of it. It was like 10.1% or 10%. And our view is could it even ever get below 10. And with COVID and crazy sales for two years, we benefited, of course, more than we were detrimented by COVID in many of our categories. And we got down below nine. And of course, normalized, it's still better than it was, and margins are still better than they were, so I think some of it is sustainable. Wages are not going to go down. The question is will they continue to go up. Again, we're going to be ahead of that, too, in terms of wanting to make sure we take care of our employees. But let's assume that a big chunk of that is -- if overall inflation subsides a little bit, I think we'll see a little less wage pressure. But look, as you know, Karen, with us, it's top line sales mostly. And the biggest thing can affect anything. I think we've shown that even with some lesser top line sales, we've been able to pull the levers in a way that still allows us to drive bottom line. And we'll continue to be pragmatic about it, but we'll have to wait and see.\nKaren Short: Sorry, just to follow up on that. So is there any way to frame what ex gas, ex gas margins, ex fuel prices -- like, what delta in sales would result in a delta in EBIT?\nRichard Galanti: Well, it's hard to say.\nKaren Short: Is there any way to calculate that?\nRichard Galanti: Not really. I mean, we used to look at almost like the old Y equals an X plus B model. Based on incremental sales, what's the variable rate of expenses in a warehouse. And in our collective view, this goes back several years, but our collective view was you needed somewhere around 4.5%, whether it was 4% or 5% of a comp number, to have flat SG&A or flat expenses at the warehouse. Certainly taking the weakness right now in big-ticket items and then taking the weakness of gas deflation, those things impact that SG&A percentage more than anything. When I look every month at our budget meetings, when the operators report on labor productivity, for example, in fresh, we're still improving in the 3% to 6% labor productivity and pounds of protein, processing pork, poultry and meat through the system. When we look at front-end labor or warehouse labor, not the ancillary business or the fresh foods or anything, but labor hours, we've shown labor productivity. Now, in the last year, with a little slowing of sales and with three unusual additional wage increases, that's going to still show a labor percent number higher as a percent of sales, which is our single biggest SG&A item, bigger than other things. But look, at the end of the day, we're still a top line company. In our view, that will mend all things. I'm sure we'd like to see something pre-inflation, back in the 5% to 7% or 8% range. But let's get from where we are now to 3% and 4%, and we'll go from there. Now, the good news also is, if I look back the last -- well, this is the second quarter that we've seen that discussion of lower sales of big-ticket discretionary items. It started actually, I think, a little bit in the quarter prior to that, not the entire quarter, just a little bit in there. So if you will, all things being equal, we'll be comparing against easier compares six months from now. But hopefully, we can do them on our own as well.\nKaren Short: That makes sense. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nJohn Heinbockel: So Richard, core-on-core, food and sundries and nonfood were up, right? So it's kind of a two-part on core-on-core. One, what drove that, right? Was that predominantly mix?\u00a0 And then, secondly, fresh food was down. Where is fresh food versus '19? And are we kind of getting to the point where that erosion is going to stop, right, because we're pretty close to '19?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Look, fresh foods are still up year over year on margins.\nUnknown speaker: No, versus '19.\nRichard Galanti: Oh, versus '19, right. Fresh foods margins are up versus '19. It went way up. Hold on a minute. I had a little cheat sheet. Yes, if I look back at just fresh foods, if I go back to '21, we had a couple of quarters where fresh foods margins were up 200 and 300 basis points year over year. By the end of '21, this was near the end of -- just lapping that craziness, that crazy goodness, we were down 190 basis points. And for all of '22, we were down anywhere from 50 to 120 basis points on a year-over-year basis, some of that compared to those plus 200 and 300 basis point numbers. This year, we're down again versus last year but down versus that giant increase in fiscal '21. When I look at where our food gross margin is today in Q3 versus pre-COVID, we're still up.\nJohn Heinbockel: OK. But the other categories that were up, right, is that predominantly mix, private brand and less big ticket?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. I think it's mixed. Like, some of the nonfood strength, as I mentioned, I threw out apparel as one of them, apparel has a strong margin. Apparel has a strong margin relative to all of our departments anyway. And majors has a weak margin generally anyway and then, of course, lower penetration of that. By the way, freight has helped too, particularly on big-ticket items, the furniture, the white goods, exercise equipment, things like that.\nJohn Heinbockel: And then, secondly, where are we on the personalization journey, right? Because I know you've done more data analytics in the last couple of years. You've got the old loyalty program, right? So when you think about wallet share and targeting promotions and emails and so forth, it looks like a huge opportunity. Where are we on that?\nRichard Galanti: Sure. By the way, one other question that we've gotten a couple of times of late because of some of the companies out there that reported much higher shrink, our shrink is intact. We haven't seen any major change in shrinkage. It fluctuated a couple, 3 basis points up really before COVID as we rolled out self-checkout. And since then, it's come back down a little bit. And so, it's been a very tight range. And so, we've been fortunate in that regard. In terms of where we are in personalization, for those of you on the call that have known me forever, it was probably four years ago that we talked about that sometime soon, we'll do targeting and after that, do personalization. Well, we're still in the early innings. But I guess what I'd like to tell you, and I think I mentioned this on the last quarter's call, just under a year ago, we hired a new VP of Digital, Digital Transformation, if you will, both in e-com and mobile sites and applications, that complemented three other outside VPs we hired, one of which was in the data analytics area. And we've really, over the last six to nine months, began a two-year road map to improve and replatform our primary e-commerce website and the same goes for our mobile apps and mobile site. Working, of course, again, with the data analytics people, the architect people, as well as the business users, we're currently building and dramatically increasing the number of engineering capabilities that we have. And we're on our way. But I'd say we're in the early innings. First order of business, which we now feel we've gotten to a much better clean data site. We're still sending you too many emails a week that don't pertain specifically to what you do. But I think you're going to see incremental changes, and I'll be able to hopefully report more on that at the next quarterly call. And just in the last three months, as an example, we've had three small releases to our mobile app that are improvements of it. And we're now on plans to have small improvements in that app each month for the several months going forward. As you know, you've heard me say for the past couple of years that we're in the early innings. I'll repeat that. We are, but we actually got, I think, a good game plan, and you'll see more to that over the future. A little longer than we had hoped to do some of this stuff, but I think we're on our way in that regard.\nJohn Heinbockel: OK. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nOliver Chen: Hi, Richard. When you think about household income, what kind of trends are you seeing in terms of your customers and people trading in and the new Costco at large? And then, the big-ticket item question, what are your thoughts on how you're planning inventory there? Do the compares ease? Do you expect improvement? And within big ticket, any color in terms of how that may proceed sequentially?\nRichard Galanti: Sure. Our annual household income has actually gone up a little, but I think that's more to do with wage increases than anything. We still over-index to higher-end people, higher-end income people. And so, that's still there. As it relates to our inventories, again, if you had asked me six months ago -- in fact, I think it was Q4 and Q1 where year over year inventories were up 26% as was our competitors and everybody else. A lot of that has to do with, one, some people had enough big-ticket items but also just the terrible supply chain challenges that we all had. And since then, like others, we've shown a reduction in that dramatically, and that's good. We feel pretty good about where we stand right now. Some of you have noted and called us on back, again, six, five, four, three months ago, we had a lot of promotional things going on. If you bought three-or-more-thousand dollars of these 10 items, and they were all like different patio items or different in-store furniture items, if you did $3,000 or more, you got a $500 cash card on already great pricing. And that was a lot of our promotional money, markdown money, to get our inventories back in line, particularly on things where we were over-inventoried because of the supply chain delays. And then, on some examples, I think air conditioners might be an example. Because of the supply chains last summer, we did great in selling through fans and air conditioners. And these are not exact numbers, but let's say we plan to sell $500 million of it, easily 20%, 25% of it got here after the summer because of the supply chain challenges. There is no need to mark those down to try to get rid of them in September, October. We held them, and we're selling through them now, and that's not an issue at all. So in talking to Claudine Adamo, our Head of Merchandising, and her nonfood people, we feel pretty good about where we are both on existing inventory levels of what we have in there and, as well as what we've committed to going forward for upcoming seasons, notably back-to-school and Christmas and things like that.\nOliver Chen: OK. And Richard, you've made a lot of great strides in Asia and China and other regions. I'd love just some highlights in terms of what's ahead for the back half there. And a second question on that connected consumer experience between digital and physical, are there evolved thoughts in terms of BOPUS and curbside and what your members want and delivering the ultimate convenience?\nRichard Galanti: Sure. Well, first of all, in terms of expansion outside of the United States, if you look at just even this year, at '23, I think it was, what, 13 and 10. So 60-ish, 60%, 65%, 60% in the U.S., Canada, which I combine as one because it's well saturated, but we're still opening a bunch of units there, and it's our oldest areas. But I see that, over the next five years, going from 65-35 or 60-40 to at least 50-50, if not trending a little bit toward outside the U.S. and Canada. Now that, again, is the same answer I would have given you six, seven years ago for now. And I think that's a function of, one, having more opportunities every day than we thought we had before in the U.S. and Canada, and there's plenty of opportunities going forward elsewhere. But I think you're still going to see us open in Korea, Taiwan a unit each year on a base of somewhere in the mid- to high teens; in Japan, more than a unit a year on a base in the low 30s; a unit a year in Australia, not exactly each year, maybe there's one in one year, none and then two. But in Australia, we've got 14, I believe. And in Europe, most of our units are in the U.K., where we're in the low 30s. We're still going to open one or two a year there or one a year probably there. And we've opened a few others. We opened our fourth in Spain, and we now have two in France and one each in Iceland and Sweden. So a little growth there. But certainly, in China, I mean, China is a big story this year for us. One of the stories is that we opened our first unit in China three and a half, four years ago; our second, a year and a half ago; our third, last December; and three more this year. We're going to be at six at the end of this year.\nUnknown speaker: Calendar year.\nRichard Galanti: Yes, I'm sorry, this calendar year, two more this fiscal year and then one more in the fall. So there's certainly more growth there, but that's not a lot of growth relative to some companies that have tried to go in and open 20 somewhere or something. But we feel good about how we do that. But we think there's plenty on -- bottom line, if we're opening 23 to 25 a year, we'd like to be a little 25-plus a year for the next five years and somewhere closer to 30 a year in year six through 10, that would make us feel quite good. And we feel very comfortable that we can do that at this juncture. In terms of curbside, we're not very thrilled about it or maybe a little stubborn about it. We tried it in a few locations a year ago and successfully proved to ourselves we don't like it. And we want you to come in. And now we do have lockers from big-ticket nonfood items. Interestingly, when people do that, they come in and over half of them shop while they're in the location. And one of our challenges, which is a good quality problem to have, is our average volume per warehouse has continued to grow way more than we had thought a few years ago. And last year, we had over 150 locations doing over $300 million, I think over 27 or 28 million doing over $400 million -- or 26. And so, we've had to open more units. And so, we're continuing to look at a lot of places even in the U.S. And we don't get a lot of ask for it, honestly. Now, we're not asking a lot about it either, but we don't get a lot of ask for it. So I don't see that being a big thing. One of the things that we will be doing though, even online, when you go to look at an online product, if we're selling in a warehouse near you based on where you've shopped, in the next several months, cross my fingers, you will be able to say, you can go ahead and get it in store at the Kirkland from Esquire location, which also has it in stock right now. Same-day grocery, of course, we already have with delivery, mostly with Instacart. We partner with a couple of other people as well, but they're the big kahuna there, both in the U.S. and Canada. And we do two-day dry -- yes. By the way, in that number, which is continuing to grow, is not reported in our income numbers. In that case, their employee or contract employee comes in, shops, rings it up and takes it to you. So that's what we consider a warehouse sale.\nOliver Chen: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks, Richard.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Your line is open.\nScott Mushkin: Hey. Thanks, Richard for taking the question. So I wanted to talk about competition a little bit. But first, shorter term, and maybe I missed the answer to this if it was asked, promotional activities now, are they -- one of your competitors said they kind of ramped up. Is that what you're seeing as well?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. It's higher than it was. Now, mind you, it was a lot lower for a couple of years because of the supply chain challenges. I mean, every TV we could sell, whatever, particularly on the nonfood, we could sell, every paper good we could sell, we actually took some items out of like the MVM mailers on the sundries side because, one, there were shortages like paper goods, why promote it when, first of all, we've got to limit one per customer. And so, some of those comparisons, there's more versus a lot less for a couple of years as well. But yes, we are seeing more now.\nScott Mushkin: And is that purely from the vendors? Or is that some activities you're seeing from retailers themselves?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I can speak for us. Yes, I mean, certainly, when we see something that other retailers are doing, we want to make sure we ask our supplier. Maybe they can't tell us, but we're putting the pressure on to know that we're seeing some unusual things out there. And we'll only hold -- sometimes we see better deals the following day to us. So we just got to stay on top of that. As I said a little earlier, I think we've got a lot of levers to pull. Certainly, all retailers that have gas right now has continued to be helped with that. Unusual things, like fresh has been relatively strong, and so we feel good about that. Even for like apparel, which is close to an $8 billion business for us worldwide, $7-plus billion business worldwide, that's been strong. So that's not promotional. That's just better margins, in some cases.\nScott Mushkin: OK. So then I wanted to talk a little bit more long term about competition. It's been a long time, I think, what we've seen as many openings from non-Costco people. You are going to see that over the next year or two, three. The other competitors also, they tout their omnichannel and their technology about just scanning and going. Just give us an overall view of the competitive environment over the next one to three years and how Costco fits, and whether you think some of those technologies and e-com stuff are competitive advantages for people that are competing against you?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think we're fortunate in one way that, first and foremost, the biggest value attribute or customer attraction attribute is the best-quality goods at the lowest price, and we dwarf everybody in that regard. I mean, our average markup on goods is in the low double digits, 12%, 13%. You know what they are at other traditional retailers, anywhere from 25% to 35% to 100%. So we have that extreme benefit to start with. Arguably, we've been somewhat simple, in our own arrogant way, over the years. One of the things we've done, as I mentioned earlier, on the question that John, I think, had, forget about personalization, even target marketing, I view it now as some low-hanging fruit that we're finally going around to do over the next couple of years. So that will be a positive to us relative to others. In terms of the benefit of buying online and picking up in store and things like that, we, frankly, view that as more costly than it is beneficial. And again, we haven't been asked a lot about it other than by analysts who are responding, in fairness, to the different retailers that feel they have to do it. Many of them want to do it. But there's a cost of doing that. So we feel pretty good about driving the business. We think we can certainly do more online. We don't have some strategic goal to go from 8%, which is still a $20 billion business, but to go from 8% of sales to 16%. But let's go from 8% to 9% to 10%, 10% to 11% over a certain period of time. And we think that, with some of the things we're doing on that side, we can. I think we've also done an incredible job, day in and day out, on the merchandising side of bringing in more exciting items. And that's something that is focused on that I hear about at every budget meeting and every Monday morning meeting with Greg and Ron and a few other senior colleagues, including our merchandising head. So I think that's what's going to keep driving our business. I think we are getting better on the technology side. Playing from behind a little bit on that, but I think we've finally got a game plan and some people that are helping build those areas up both from a marketing and advertising standpoint, taking advantage of the advertising dollars that are out there that we've done pretty well despite ourselves but we know we can do a lot better in grabbing some of those dollars. And what we will use it for is to drive sales.\nScott Mushkin: And the club openings, I don't think you touched on that.\nRichard Galanti: The big club opening thing is we're on our target. I think the last three years, there was a big down year because of the first year of COVID. But fiscal '21, '22 and '23, I think we averaged around 23 net new units a year, 22, 23. We'd like to get above 25 over each of the next five years and closer to 30 year six through 10. That's kind of the game plan. And that really is a bottom-up approach by each of the eight U.S. geographic regions, the two Canadian regions and every other country region, working with operations in our real estate department kind of which ones are likely and what's our priority. And we feel pretty comfortable we've got a good pipeline of pending openings, for sure, over the next three or four years and with an equal level of comfort that we feel that we'll continue to have plenty of opportunities to open units.\nScott Mushkin: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Your line is open.\nBrandon Cheatham: Hey, Richard, this Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. I want to follow up on what you mentioned about the digital investments that you all are making. It sounds like it's something that eventually you might monetize partnering with your vendors. How do you balance that with your view that you really want your members in your warehouse? And how do you see that working kind of over the long term?\nRichard Galanti: Well, first of all, as part of that monetizing of digital is in warehouse. We've been very successful at moving the needle, if you will, on a holiday weekend with hot prices on strip steaks or, at the beginning of the season, with the planting season, with green items. And so, I think it's just we're getting around and doing a better job of it, and we're bringing in people that have done it before, frankly. Even in membership marketing, Sandy Torrey, Senior VP of Membership and Marketing, she's doing more things today than we did even a year ago, trying some things. And again, I think that our first order of business is to drive business in store, certainly driving it online as well, but not to just replace what's in store. Again, I tried to stay a little low key on this subject because we're not -- I hate to use the word this new strategic effort. But what we've learned over the last few years is everybody is a technology company today, and there are some things that we have been a little slow to doing, and we know there's a lot of opportunity there to do some of the even basic things. Not how do you get five emails a week that none of which relates specifically to you. If it was an email, even just based on a couple of items you purchased in store that had a banner of items that you might be interested in, you could literally double the click rate on them. So those are the kind of things that bringing in the fore, what we call catalyst VP hires, in our IT department over the last few years. One is data analytics and one is digital, and it's not just two individuals, it's the teams that they have built in short order. So we'll continue to do that and tell you more as we go along.\nBrandon Cheatham: Got it. And if I could follow up on the membership side, you mentioned membership marketing. Are you seeing any difference in promotions from your competitors for their memberships? How has that informed what you all are doing? And is there any major change on promotions, on membership from your competitors?\nRichard Galanti: Well, for us, there's really no change. I mean, we do a few promotional things each year. But the biggest thing that we don't do is in any big way discount our membership. Some of the brochure things that you may sign up for a membership and you get a certain number of coupons related to stuff. I don't want to go into that, but you can look at our competitors and see what they do. There's a lot more promotional activity going on elsewhere. And we're still getting, as I mentioned on the call, year over year 7% increase in new memberships with about just under a 3% increase in number of new warehouses. So we're still getting people indoor. I think in fairness, that's been helped by COVID. We being warehouse clubs was a big cavernous place to come and get a lot of things, and that certainly helped us. I'd like to think we're pretty good at what we do, and that's why more people are signing up, and we're opening new units and driving more business that way. But really, we have not done -- if anything, we've done a little less on the promotional side in membership. We do a few promotional things each year, but not a lot.\nBrandon Cheatham: Got it. Thank you. Good luck.\nRichard Galanti: I'm going to take one more question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is open.\nRupesh Parikh: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question.\u00a0 So in China, I was curious with the reopening there, how the locations are performing versus your expectations.\nRichard Galanti: They're doing great. End of story. We've been blessed by those first openings that we have over there. Needless to say, we were impacted, like everybody over there, during the shutdown and what have you. And we had some great video clips in our budget meetings here showing what we did to create care packages not only for our members but for the neighborhoods around us. And we were told they were the best care packages of any of the big retailers, so that made us feel good.\nRupesh Parikh: Great. And then, maybe just one follow-up question. So as you look at your bigger-ticket categories, consumer electronics, etc., any sense at this point whether trends have bottomed? Just curious if you think trends have bottomed or whether we could see further softening in some of these bigger-ticket areas?\nRichard Galanti: I have one of my colleagues here on the merchandising side, and she was saying to me softly the negatives are getting better. And again, it's about seven or eight months ago, seven-ish months ago, when we started seeing the decline. And so, if nothing else, we'll be having an easier compare five months, hence. But certainly, we've seen a little bit of improvement in the negatives.\nRupesh Parikh: All right. Thank you.\nRichard Galanti: Well, thank you, everyone. David, Josh and I are around to answer questions if you have any more, which I'm sure you will. Have a good afternoon.\nOperator: [Operator signoff]",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Galanti",
            "content": "Thank you, Josh, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the 12 weeks ended this past May 7. Reported net income for the quarter was $1.30 billion or $2.93 per diluted share. This compared to $1.35 billion or $3.04 per diluted share a year ago in the third quarter. This year's results included a nonrecurring charge to merchandise costs of $298 million pre-tax or $0.50 per share, primarily for the discontinuation of our charter shipping activities. Last year's results included a nonrecurring $77 million pre-tax charge or $0.13 per share for incremental employee benefits. As many of you know, two years ago, we initially leased three ships and thousands of containers to help mitigate some of the significant overseas freight challenges that we were experiencing. Later, we added four additional vessels and several thousand additional containers with commitments made for up to then three additional years. Procuring these ships and containers was integral to us being able to stay in stock for our members during those challenging times. It also allowed us to do so initially at a lower cost than the market rates at that time. Shipping and freight markets have improved dramatically since that time, which led us to reevaluate our position. As you recall, in the first quarter of this fiscal year, we took a charge to downsize by two vessels our charter shipping activities. Since then, shipping and container rates have continued to fall. And in the third quarter, this third quarter, we concluded that it would be appropriate to completely discontinue the remainder of our charter shipping activities. As a result of this decision, we recorded an impairment charge for all remaining charter assets. This decision allows our merchandising teams to take full advantage of the current shipping market rates as opposed to much higher contracted charter rates. In turn, this allows us to do what we do best and lower prices for our members. In terms of sales. Net sales for the third quarter increased 1.9% to $52.6 billion versus $51.61 billion reported last year in the third quarter. Comparable sales for the quarter were as follows: in the U.S., on a reported basis, minus 0.1%, and excluding gas deflation and FX, plus 1.8%; Canada, reported, minus 1%, ex gas and FX, plus 7.4%; and Other International, reported, plus 4.1%, and ex gas and FX, plus 8.4%. So total company, on a reported basis, 0.3% comp sales, and ex gas deflation and FX at plus 3.5%. And our e-commerce on a reported basis was minus 10% and minus 9%, excluding FX. In terms of third quarter comp sales metrics. Traffic or shopping frequency remains pretty good, increasing 4.8% worldwide and 3.5% in the U.S. during the quarter. Our average daily transaction or ticket was down 4.2% worldwide and down 3.5% in the U.S., impacted, in large part, from weakness in bigger-ticket nonfood discretionary items. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 1.5%, and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 1.7%. Next on the income statement is membership fee income. For the quarter, we reported $1.044 billion of membership fee income or 1.98% of sales compared to $984 million or 1.91% a year ago in the third quarter, so a $60 million or 6.1% increase in membership fees. Excluding the headwinds in FX, the $60 million increase would have been higher by $17 million or up year over year 8%, adjusted for FX. In terms of renewal rates, at third quarter end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate was 92.6%, and our worldwide rate came in at 90.5%. These figures are the same all-time high renewal rates that were achieved in the second quarter, just 12 weeks ago here. Membership growth continues. We ended Q3 with 69.1 paid household members and 124.7 million cardholders, both up approximately 7% versus a year ago. At third quarter end, we had 31.3 million paid executive members, an increase of 681,000 or 57,000 per week during the 12-week fiscal third quarter. Executive members now represent a little over 45% of our paid members and approximately 73% of worldwide sales. Moving down the income statement. Next is our gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the third quarter was higher year over year on a reported basis by 13 basis points, coming in at 10.32% as compared to a 10.19% number a year earlier. The 13 basis point positive ex gas deflation was minus 3 basis points. Both of these numbers, of course, includes a little more than 50 basis point impairment charge to margin mentioned in today's earnings release. As I normally do, I'll ask you to jot down a few numbers, two columns: a reported column and then column excluding gas deflation. The first item would be, for the third quarter of '23, core merchandise margin. On a reported basis, it was up year over year 39 basis points and ex gas deflation, up 24; ancillary and other, plus 13 and plus nine; 2% Reward, minus 11 and minus nine; LIFO, plus 25 and plus 25; and other, minus 53 and minus 52. If you add up the two columns, again, you get to the reported number of, on a reported basis, gross margin year over year in the quarter was up 13 basis points, and ex gas deflation, down 3 basis points. So starting over the core. Again, core was up, on a reported basis, 39 basis points year over year and 24 ex gas deflation. In terms of core margins on their own core sales, or core-on-core margins, they were higher by 17 basis points, with food and sundries and nonfoods being up and fresh foods being down a little. Ancillary and other businesses gross margin was higher by 13 and again higher by nine ex gas deflation. Within the ancillary businesses, gasoline, business centers, food court and travel were better year over year, offset in part by e-com. 2% Reward, again, higher by 11 basis points and higher by nine ex gas deflation. Higher sales penetration coming from our executive members is certainly part of that. LIFO, plus 25 basis points year over year, both with and without gas deflation. As you recall, a year ago, in the third quarter, we had $130 million charge for LIFO. In this fiscal year, we had no LIFO charge. So $130 million year-over-year improvement on that line item. Note also that in the fourth quarter a year ago, we had a $223 million LIFO charge. So we'll see how that goes in the fourth quarter this year. Other was lower by 53 basis points reported and 52 ex gas deflation. This was net of items for both years. This year, there was a 57 basis point negative impact from the $298 million pre-tax charge, again, primarily related to terminating our charter shipping activities. This was partially offset by lapping last year's $77 million charge for incremental employee benefits, of which $20 million or 4 basis points related to gross margin. The remaining $57 million, I'll talk about it in a minute under SG&A. Moving on to SG&A. Our reported SG&A this year was nine.11% compared to 8.62% a year ago. So on a reported basis, higher by 49 basis points, and ex gas deflation, higher by 34%. As with gross margin, I'll ask you to jot down two columns of numbers, both reported and one excluding gas deflation. First item is operations, higher by 48 basis points and minus 35 basis points; central, minus 11 and minus nine; stock compensation, zero in both columns; preopening, minus one and minus one; other, plus 11 and plus 11. If you add all those up, again, on a reported basis, 49 basis points higher year over year, and ex gas deflation, 34. Now, to core operations. This negative included, of course, the impact of slower sales growth, as well as the impact of a few of the wage increases that we did that are typically out of the normal cycle over the last year -- over a year. And that included the impact of four weeks of wage and benefits increases implemented last March, the additional top-of-scale increase that went into effect July 4, and eight weeks of this March is higher than normal top-of-scale increase. Despite the slowing sales growth, we've continued to invest in our employees over the past year, and that's always been a priority for us. Central, higher by 11 and higher by nine ex gas deflation. Again, sales growth -- there's no big single item that was an outlier there. But sales growth overall, in my view, was the impact. Stock comp, flat both with and without gas deflation, so no impact there. Preopening again, higher by 1 basis point. We had five openings this year in the quarter and three last year but, again, 1 basis point delta year over year. And Other, 11 basis point positive, both with and without gas deflation. This is a result of lapping that $77 million charge, within SG&A, lapping $57 million of that $77 million charge for the incremental employee benefits, again, discussed earlier in the release. Below the operating income line, interest expense came in at $36 million, $1 million over last year's $35 million number. And interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $57 million year over year. This was driven by an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates and cash balances. And an increase in interest income was partially offset by less favorable FX versus last year. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the third quarter came in at 26.5%. That compared to 24.9% in Q3 last year. The fiscal '23 effective rate, excluding discrete items, is currently projected to be in the 26% to 27% range. Overall, reported net income was down year over year by 4 percentage points, net of the two nonrecurring items in both years' third quarters. Net income would have been up 8% even being reflected with that higher income tax rate. In terms of warehouse expansion, to date, we've opened 17 locations in the first three quarters and also including three relocations, so net of that, 14 net new locations. In Q4, we have nine new openings with no relos, so net of nine. That will put us at 26 openings, less the three relos, to be a 23 net new for this year. In the quarter, again, we opened five, with four being net new. In addition to the relocation in Canada, we had two new buildings in the U.S. opened, and one additional building opened in each of Japan and China. Again, of the nine new buildings planned for our fiscal fourth quarter, that includes our North Tulsa, Oklahoma opening that opened this morning, and our fourth and fifth buildings in China planned for June and August. These Q4 planned openings will bring our full year account to 26 less the three, or net of 23, and that is made up of 13 in the U.S. and 10 outside of the U.S.  Regarding capital expenditures. In Q3 of the fiscal year, we spent approximately $819 million. Our estimate for all of fiscal '23, capex is approximately $4 billion. Moving on to e-commerce. You saw in the release that e-commerce was a minus 10% sales decline on a comp basis and ex FX, minus 9%. E-com sales, more to the same story in terms of the sales, as I discussed on our second quarter call and in our monthly sales recordings. In Q3, big-ticket discretionary departments, notably majors, home furnishings, small electrics, jewelry and hardware, were down about 20% in e-com and made up 55% of e-com sales. These same departments were down about 17% in warehouse, but they only make up 8% in warehouse sales. A few comments on inflation. Inflation continues to abate somewhat. If you go back a year ago to the fourth quarter of '22 last summer, we had estimated that year over year inflation at the time was up 8%. And by Q1 and Q2, it was down to 6% and 7% and then 5% and 6%. In this quarter, we're estimating the year over year inflation in the 3% to 4% range. We continue to see improvements in many items, notably food items like nuts, eggs and meat, as well as items that include, as part of their components, commodities like steel and resins on the nonfood side. Switching over to inventory levels. Inventories overall are in pretty good shape. As of quarter end, our inventories year over year as of the end of the third quarter were down 7%. Recall that they had been up during some of the supply chain challenges of last year. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results for the four weeks ending Sunday, May 28, next Thursday on June 1, after market close. And also remember that our fiscal fourth quarter has an extra week this year. So our quarter ending September 3, 2023, will have 17 weeks versus 16 weeks in the fiscal fourth quarter. With that, I'll open it up for questions and answers and turn it back over to Josh. Thank you. Well, look, that's something that our merchants work on literally every day and every week. I remember when inflation was peaking at 8% and 9% and some out there would say -- and we're known for trying to hold the line and work with our suppliers, how much will they eat of that, how much will we eat of that. At the end of the day, if margins year over year were down 50 or 100 basis points back then, that implies that some portion of it, maybe instead of an 8% or 9% increase, our members were seeing a 6% or 7% or 8% increase. Whatever that was, we felt that we were doing as good a job as anyone out there given the item nature of our business to lower prices for our members and hopefully drive sales. Certainly, right now, we're -- we've always been a little bit, compared to others, over indexed in bigger-ticket discretionary items. That's getting hit arguably more than others. If you look at our fresh foods and food and sundries, they're in the mid- to mid-high singles. You look at the nonfoods and some of the ancillaries, notably gasoline, which is 11% year over year deflation in gas prices, that's in the mid-single negatives. So it all adds up to where it is. Every day, we look to drive sales. What will it take to get to whatever X is? Who the heck knows? I just know that our merchants and Craig and Ron and Claudine, our Head of Merchandising, are pushing the buyers each day to do that and figuring out how can we take the monies that we get, any types of monies, from the vendors that can be used to drive business. One of the reasons that it made sense for us to discontinue the containers and the shipping vessels is to reduce the cost that our buyers are seeing relative to these much higher contract rates now. We were smart for a year. And now looking back, it was good to get out of it. And that allowed us to be more competitive as well. So I feel we're doing a great job of being very competitive. When we do comp shops against our direct warehouse club competitors, as well as different components, whether it's retail food or general merchandise on the buildings, home improvement side, we feel very good about our competitive position and what we're doing to do that. Well, first of all, on the question of deflation, let's hope that there is. And you will be the first to see it at Costco, in my view. As it relates to membership fees, nice try, Michael. But at the end of the day, with the headline being inflation, we feel very good about if we want to do it, can we do it without impacting, in any meaningful way, renewal rates or sign-ups or anything. And at some point, we will. But our view right now is that we've got enough leverage out there to drive business, and we feel that it's incumbent upon us to be that beacon of light to our members in terms of holding them for right now. It's not a matter of a big time, but we'll let you know as soon as we know. Well, first of all, we look at traffic. We're getting people in the door, and we know what they're buying. They're buying nondiscretionary items. They're buying fresh foods. They're buying food and sundries. They're buying apparel in a big way. They're buying patio furniture now that the weather has turned in a big way; indoor furniture, not as much. We all know what's going on with consumer electronics out there. While all the numbers, industrywide, are down, ours are down a little less, but they're down. So overall, when we look at what else can we do to drive more nonfood business but, at the same time, can we bring in a few more items on the food and sundry side because we know traffic is good there. It's simple impulse items that sell for $15 to $25. So that's what we do every day, and that's what Claudine and her staff and merchants are doing. Well, yes, gallons are close to flat. The average price per gallon during the quarter was down 11%. So that's, I don't have the number, 12% or 13% of our sales, which was -- the average price point per cell unit, if you will, was down 11%. year over year, gasoline was profitable in both quarters nicely. As I've said, I'm sure I said last year, in Q3 and this year, it helped a little year over year but not a lot. Last year, in Q4, it was a strong number. And then, you got an extra week, and we'll see how it goes this year. But right now, gasoline continues to be quite profitable for us. Well, first, look, we work with our suppliers every day and it's going to be a partnership there. Again, I think it's easier for us, on the one hand, that we do a lot of volume on a fewer items. We have buyers that literally are managing a couple of dozen items, not 200 items. And I remember, when certain commodity prices like resins and steel were going up, in our monthly budget meeting hearing from the merchants how, while we're committing out five, six months for seasonal items, like patio furniture, barbecue grills, a couple of years ago, we want to know when the vendor was increasing the price on whatever it was, whether it was a major consumer products company or some manufacturer of nonfood items like that. Why? Exactly why? How much of it's labor? How much of it's the commodity cost? And how much is transportation cost and wage pressure? Whatever. And as we saw commodities coming down, I'd like to think that we were the first ones on the phone with our suppliers wanting to know when the price is going to drop. And understandably, in some cases, the supplier had committed to a season of three or four months. And so, there was some delay, and we worked with them there. In addition, as we said, we're going to invest a little on price. How much are you willing to invest in price? So it's a partnership. And I think we are in a better position to do that simply because, if you take our $230 billion or $240 billion in sales and divide it by 3,800 SKUs, it's a lot more pricing power per SKU and a lot more focus on an item-by-item basis. So that's what we do. And as there are promotional monies out there from the suppliers, this goes back to the beginning of time around here. I remember with the traditional co-op advertising dollars, a supplier wanted you to spend $0.05 of our own money and add it to $0.05 of theirs to do $0.10 of advertising of their product. And we said, just give us the $0.05 and we'll base it on a $0.95 cost, not a dollar cost. And that's what we still do. And so, I think we have to be smart about knowing what every bucket of money is out there, whether it's promotional monies or ad monies, or ad monies online now, and work with our suppliers to do that. And in our case, also, we do what we call the MVM, the multi-vendor mailers, the coupon books that we send out 11 times a year, and not only that but hot buys in-store and what we call temporary price discounts and what can drive sales. The other part of that is, when we get monies, in some cases, how much elasticity is there in driving business by lowering their price. In some categories, particularly some of the bigger-ticket categories right now, there's not an appetite by the consumer necessarily for that. So how do we add value to the item or do more things to it to drive business? It's all of the above. Well, when there was low inflation and not an overarching concern about a recession, when the world was seen to be comping three, four, five and six years ago at 2% to 4%, we were 5% to 7%. Our view is, because we got great members buying more with great loyalty and the best prices by a major difference and quality, and so we've succeeded under those. I think right now, in my view, more of it relates to the fact that we're not only dealing with big-ticket discretionary items weakness which, again, when we look at like MPD  and everything, we're doing better in most of those categories. Our negative is not as negative as others out there. In addition, we're comparing against two years of outsized growth in some of those things as people were buying things from their home. We saw outsized sales in indoor and outdoor furniture and electronics and TVs and exercise equipment. And so, we're not only comparing against this \"recession\" or concerns about big-ticket items but comparing against uber strength over the last two years prior to that. So I think we'll come out of this fine. We're pretty good at figuring out new items and new things to do. And we're not just focused on how do we drive sales another 1% or 2% but how can we drive sales when bringing in new and exciting stuff. And we continue to do that. And this is anecdotal, but over the last year, year and a half, we've always been very good at taking what I'll call big American cross-scale products, including a lot of KS, and having huge success overseas. We're now, on a conscious basis, figuring out what the unique, exciting overseas items can we bring elsewhere in the world, including the U.S. and Canada. And we're having good experience with some of those things. These are all small things, but there's lots of little small things around here that add up. Yes. By the way, when I was talking earlier about down, the margins were a little weaker on fresh. Sales have been fine. In the quarter, again, when you look at a reported total company sales number of 0.3%, or 3.5% ex gas and FX, but within that 0.3% reported, fresh was mid-singles, food and sundries is mid- to high singles, nonfoods was a little over mid-single negative. Yes. And by the way, not just in this current \"recession\" or concern for recession, historically, like within fresh protein, we've always seen when there's a recession, whether it was '99 or '00 or '08, '09, '10, we would see some sales penetration shift from beef to poultry and pork. We have seen some of that now. I think anecdotally, I heard a few months ago from our Head of Food and Sundries buyer, that we saw some switch even to some canned products, like canned chicken and canned tuna and things like that. But on the KS side, we've also seen that. I think last quarter, I mentioned that on a year-over-year basis, there's a 150 basis point increase in private label sales penetration. And this year, at the end of the quarter, it's 120 basis points. So still, over a full percentage point delta in sales penetration. If you go back over the last 10 years, my guess is that on a year-over-year basis, maybe we've gone from, I'm guessing, 22% or 23% to 25% or 26%. So call it, 300 basis points over 10 years or eight years. So 30 to 50 basis points versus 120 and 150 in the last couple of quarters. So yes, that would, again, at least anecdotally, suggest that we've seen people looking for better bargains. We try to correct people when they said was it a downgrading because, arguably, it was an upgrade when they went to Kirkland Signature. Well, I'd be remiss if I even can think of a number off the top of my head here. In our view, first of all, in a deflation, we'll be the first out there lowering prices with it. And I'd like to think that we could drive business with it. The other thing is look at even something like gasoline. I think all retailers out there that have gasoline operations have, in the last few years, reflected higher profitability from gas. In our view, we have higher profitability, and we have the most extreme savings versus everybody else, so we've been able to make a little more per gallon because others have decided to make more than a little more. And I think that same thing holds true elsewhere. When we look at our competitive price shops against our direct club competitors and against others on key items like fresh with supermarkets, again, those price gaps between us and our competition have not changed. They're still as strong as we feel they should be. And so, again, it's hard to say what -- your comment about some of the highest pre-tax margins, let's face it, I remember looking at even like SG&A, which was up year over year, of course. If you go back pre-COVID, I think our SG&A on a reported basis had a 10 in front of it. It was like 10.1% or 10%. And our view is could it even ever get below 10. And with COVID and crazy sales for two years, we benefited, of course, more than we were detrimented by COVID in many of our categories. And we got down below nine. And of course, normalized, it's still better than it was, and margins are still better than they were, so I think some of it is sustainable. Wages are not going to go down. The question is will they continue to go up. Again, we're going to be ahead of that, too, in terms of wanting to make sure we take care of our employees. But let's assume that a big chunk of that is -- if overall inflation subsides a little bit, I think we'll see a little less wage pressure. But look, as you know, Karen, with us, it's top line sales mostly. And the biggest thing can affect anything. I think we've shown that even with some lesser top line sales, we've been able to pull the levers in a way that still allows us to drive bottom line. And we'll continue to be pragmatic about it, but we'll have to wait and see. Well, it's hard to say. Not really. I mean, we used to look at almost like the old Y equals an X plus B model. Based on incremental sales, what's the variable rate of expenses in a warehouse. And in our collective view, this goes back several years, but our collective view was you needed somewhere around 4.5%, whether it was 4% or 5% of a comp number, to have flat SG&A or flat expenses at the warehouse. Certainly taking the weakness right now in big-ticket items and then taking the weakness of gas deflation, those things impact that SG&A percentage more than anything. When I look every month at our budget meetings, when the operators report on labor productivity, for example, in fresh, we're still improving in the 3% to 6% labor productivity and pounds of protein, processing pork, poultry and meat through the system. When we look at front-end labor or warehouse labor, not the ancillary business or the fresh foods or anything, but labor hours, we've shown labor productivity. Now, in the last year, with a little slowing of sales and with three unusual additional wage increases, that's going to still show a labor percent number higher as a percent of sales, which is our single biggest SG&A item, bigger than other things. But look, at the end of the day, we're still a top line company. In our view, that will mend all things. I'm sure we'd like to see something pre-inflation, back in the 5% to 7% or 8% range. But let's get from where we are now to 3% and 4%, and we'll go from there. Now, the good news also is, if I look back the last -- well, this is the second quarter that we've seen that discussion of lower sales of big-ticket discretionary items. It started actually, I think, a little bit in the quarter prior to that, not the entire quarter, just a little bit in there. So if you will, all things being equal, we'll be comparing against easier compares six months from now. But hopefully, we can do them on our own as well. Yes. Look, fresh foods are still up year over year on margins. Oh, versus '19, right. Fresh foods margins are up versus '19. It went way up. Hold on a minute. I had a little cheat sheet. Yes, if I look back at just fresh foods, if I go back to '21, we had a couple of quarters where fresh foods margins were up 200 and 300 basis points year over year. By the end of '21, this was near the end of -- just lapping that craziness, that crazy goodness, we were down 190 basis points. And for all of '22, we were down anywhere from 50 to 120 basis points on a year-over-year basis, some of that compared to those plus 200 and 300 basis point numbers. This year, we're down again versus last year but down versus that giant increase in fiscal '21. When I look at where our food gross margin is today in Q3 versus pre-COVID, we're still up. Yes. I think it's mixed. Like, some of the nonfood strength, as I mentioned, I threw out apparel as one of them, apparel has a strong margin. Apparel has a strong margin relative to all of our departments anyway. And majors has a weak margin generally anyway and then, of course, lower penetration of that. By the way, freight has helped too, particularly on big-ticket items, the furniture, the white goods, exercise equipment, things like that. Sure. By the way, one other question that we've gotten a couple of times of late because of some of the companies out there that reported much higher shrink, our shrink is intact. We haven't seen any major change in shrinkage. It fluctuated a couple, 3 basis points up really before COVID as we rolled out self-checkout. And since then, it's come back down a little bit. And so, it's been a very tight range. And so, we've been fortunate in that regard. In terms of where we are in personalization, for those of you on the call that have known me forever, it was probably four years ago that we talked about that sometime soon, we'll do targeting and after that, do personalization. Well, we're still in the early innings. But I guess what I'd like to tell you, and I think I mentioned this on the last quarter's call, just under a year ago, we hired a new VP of Digital, Digital Transformation, if you will, both in e-com and mobile sites and applications, that complemented three other outside VPs we hired, one of which was in the data analytics area. And we've really, over the last six to nine months, began a two-year road map to improve and replatform our primary e-commerce website and the same goes for our mobile apps and mobile site. Working, of course, again, with the data analytics people, the architect people, as well as the business users, we're currently building and dramatically increasing the number of engineering capabilities that we have. And we're on our way. But I'd say we're in the early innings. First order of business, which we now feel we've gotten to a much better clean data site. We're still sending you too many emails a week that don't pertain specifically to what you do. But I think you're going to see incremental changes, and I'll be able to hopefully report more on that at the next quarterly call. And just in the last three months, as an example, we've had three small releases to our mobile app that are improvements of it. And we're now on plans to have small improvements in that app each month for the several months going forward. As you know, you've heard me say for the past couple of years that we're in the early innings. I'll repeat that. We are, but we actually got, I think, a good game plan, and you'll see more to that over the future. A little longer than we had hoped to do some of this stuff, but I think we're on our way in that regard. Sure. Our annual household income has actually gone up a little, but I think that's more to do with wage increases than anything. We still over-index to higher-end people, higher-end income people. And so, that's still there. As it relates to our inventories, again, if you had asked me six months ago -- in fact, I think it was Q4 and Q1 where year over year inventories were up 26% as was our competitors and everybody else. A lot of that has to do with, one, some people had enough big-ticket items but also just the terrible supply chain challenges that we all had. And since then, like others, we've shown a reduction in that dramatically, and that's good. We feel pretty good about where we stand right now. Some of you have noted and called us on back, again, six, five, four, three months ago, we had a lot of promotional things going on. If you bought three-or-more-thousand dollars of these 10 items, and they were all like different patio items or different in-store furniture items, if you did $3,000 or more, you got a $500 cash card on already great pricing. And that was a lot of our promotional money, markdown money, to get our inventories back in line, particularly on things where we were over-inventoried because of the supply chain delays. And then, on some examples, I think air conditioners might be an example. Because of the supply chains last summer, we did great in selling through fans and air conditioners. And these are not exact numbers, but let's say we plan to sell $500 million of it, easily 20%, 25% of it got here after the summer because of the supply chain challenges. There is no need to mark those down to try to get rid of them in September, October. We held them, and we're selling through them now, and that's not an issue at all. So in talking to Claudine Adamo, our Head of Merchandising, and her nonfood people, we feel pretty good about where we are both on existing inventory levels of what we have in there and, as well as what we've committed to going forward for upcoming seasons, notably back-to-school and Christmas and things like that. Sure. Well, first of all, in terms of expansion outside of the United States, if you look at just even this year, at '23, I think it was, what, 13 and 10. So 60-ish, 60%, 65%, 60% in the U.S., Canada, which I combine as one because it's well saturated, but we're still opening a bunch of units there, and it's our oldest areas. But I see that, over the next five years, going from 65-35 or 60-40 to at least 50-50, if not trending a little bit toward outside the U.S. and Canada. Now that, again, is the same answer I would have given you six, seven years ago for now. And I think that's a function of, one, having more opportunities every day than we thought we had before in the U.S. and Canada, and there's plenty of opportunities going forward elsewhere. But I think you're still going to see us open in Korea, Taiwan a unit each year on a base of somewhere in the mid- to high teens; in Japan, more than a unit a year on a base in the low 30s; a unit a year in Australia, not exactly each year, maybe there's one in one year, none and then two. But in Australia, we've got 14, I believe. And in Europe, most of our units are in the U.K., where we're in the low 30s. We're still going to open one or two a year there or one a year probably there. And we've opened a few others. We opened our fourth in Spain, and we now have two in France and one each in Iceland and Sweden. So a little growth there. But certainly, in China, I mean, China is a big story this year for us. One of the stories is that we opened our first unit in China three and a half, four years ago; our second, a year and a half ago; our third, last December; and three more this year. We're going to be at six at the end of this year. Yes, I'm sorry, this calendar year, two more this fiscal year and then one more in the fall. So there's certainly more growth there, but that's not a lot of growth relative to some companies that have tried to go in and open 20 somewhere or something. But we feel good about how we do that. But we think there's plenty on -- bottom line, if we're opening 23 to 25 a year, we'd like to be a little 25-plus a year for the next five years and somewhere closer to 30 a year in year six through 10, that would make us feel quite good. And we feel very comfortable that we can do that at this juncture. In terms of curbside, we're not very thrilled about it or maybe a little stubborn about it. We tried it in a few locations a year ago and successfully proved to ourselves we don't like it. And we want you to come in. And now we do have lockers from big-ticket nonfood items. Interestingly, when people do that, they come in and over half of them shop while they're in the location. And one of our challenges, which is a good quality problem to have, is our average volume per warehouse has continued to grow way more than we had thought a few years ago. And last year, we had over 150 locations doing over $300 million, I think over 27 or 28 million doing over $400 million -- or 26. And so, we've had to open more units. And so, we're continuing to look at a lot of places even in the U.S. And we don't get a lot of ask for it, honestly. Now, we're not asking a lot about it either, but we don't get a lot of ask for it. So I don't see that being a big thing. One of the things that we will be doing though, even online, when you go to look at an online product, if we're selling in a warehouse near you based on where you've shopped, in the next several months, cross my fingers, you will be able to say, you can go ahead and get it in store at the Kirkland from Esquire location, which also has it in stock right now. Same-day grocery, of course, we already have with delivery, mostly with Instacart. We partner with a couple of other people as well, but they're the big kahuna there, both in the U.S. and Canada. And we do two-day dry -- yes. By the way, in that number, which is continuing to grow, is not reported in our income numbers. In that case, their employee or contract employee comes in, shops, rings it up and takes it to you. So that's what we consider a warehouse sale. Yes. It's higher than it was. Now, mind you, it was a lot lower for a couple of years because of the supply chain challenges. I mean, every TV we could sell, whatever, particularly on the nonfood, we could sell, every paper good we could sell, we actually took some items out of like the MVM mailers on the sundries side because, one, there were shortages like paper goods, why promote it when, first of all, we've got to limit one per customer. And so, some of those comparisons, there's more versus a lot less for a couple of years as well. But yes, we are seeing more now. Well, I can speak for us. Yes, I mean, certainly, when we see something that other retailers are doing, we want to make sure we ask our supplier. Maybe they can't tell us, but we're putting the pressure on to know that we're seeing some unusual things out there. And we'll only hold -- sometimes we see better deals the following day to us. So we just got to stay on top of that. As I said a little earlier, I think we've got a lot of levers to pull. Certainly, all retailers that have gas right now has continued to be helped with that. Unusual things, like fresh has been relatively strong, and so we feel good about that. Even for like apparel, which is close to an $8 billion business for us worldwide, $7-plus billion business worldwide, that's been strong. So that's not promotional. That's just better margins, in some cases. Well, I think we're fortunate in one way that, first and foremost, the biggest value attribute or customer attraction attribute is the best-quality goods at the lowest price, and we dwarf everybody in that regard. I mean, our average markup on goods is in the low double digits, 12%, 13%. You know what they are at other traditional retailers, anywhere from 25% to 35% to 100%. So we have that extreme benefit to start with. Arguably, we've been somewhat simple, in our own arrogant way, over the years. One of the things we've done, as I mentioned earlier, on the question that John, I think, had, forget about personalization, even target marketing, I view it now as some low-hanging fruit that we're finally going around to do over the next couple of years. So that will be a positive to us relative to others. In terms of the benefit of buying online and picking up in store and things like that, we, frankly, view that as more costly than it is beneficial. And again, we haven't been asked a lot about it other than by analysts who are responding, in fairness, to the different retailers that feel they have to do it. Many of them want to do it. But there's a cost of doing that. So we feel pretty good about driving the business. We think we can certainly do more online. We don't have some strategic goal to go from 8%, which is still a $20 billion business, but to go from 8% of sales to 16%. But let's go from 8% to 9% to 10%, 10% to 11% over a certain period of time. And we think that, with some of the things we're doing on that side, we can. I think we've also done an incredible job, day in and day out, on the merchandising side of bringing in more exciting items. And that's something that is focused on that I hear about at every budget meeting and every Monday morning meeting with Greg and Ron and a few other senior colleagues, including our merchandising head. So I think that's what's going to keep driving our business. I think we are getting better on the technology side. Playing from behind a little bit on that, but I think we've finally got a game plan and some people that are helping build those areas up both from a marketing and advertising standpoint, taking advantage of the advertising dollars that are out there that we've done pretty well despite ourselves but we know we can do a lot better in grabbing some of those dollars. And what we will use it for is to drive sales. The big club opening thing is we're on our target. I think the last three years, there was a big down year because of the first year of COVID. But fiscal '21, '22 and '23, I think we averaged around 23 net new units a year, 22, 23. We'd like to get above 25 over each of the next five years and closer to 30 year six through 10. That's kind of the game plan. And that really is a bottom-up approach by each of the eight U.S. geographic regions, the two Canadian regions and every other country region, working with operations in our real estate department kind of which ones are likely and what's our priority. And we feel pretty comfortable we've got a good pipeline of pending openings, for sure, over the next three or four years and with an equal level of comfort that we feel that we'll continue to have plenty of opportunities to open units. Well, first of all, as part of that monetizing of digital is in warehouse. We've been very successful at moving the needle, if you will, on a holiday weekend with hot prices on strip steaks or, at the beginning of the season, with the planting season, with green items. And so, I think it's just we're getting around and doing a better job of it, and we're bringing in people that have done it before, frankly. Even in membership marketing, Sandy Torrey, Senior VP of Membership and Marketing, she's doing more things today than we did even a year ago, trying some things. And again, I think that our first order of business is to drive business in store, certainly driving it online as well, but not to just replace what's in store. Again, I tried to stay a little low key on this subject because we're not -- I hate to use the word this new strategic effort. But what we've learned over the last few years is everybody is a technology company today, and there are some things that we have been a little slow to doing, and we know there's a lot of opportunity there to do some of the even basic things. Not how do you get five emails a week that none of which relates specifically to you. If it was an email, even just based on a couple of items you purchased in store that had a banner of items that you might be interested in, you could literally double the click rate on them. So those are the kind of things that bringing in the fore, what we call catalyst VP hires, in our IT department over the last few years. One is data analytics and one is digital, and it's not just two individuals, it's the teams that they have built in short order. So we'll continue to do that and tell you more as we go along. Well, for us, there's really no change. I mean, we do a few promotional things each year. But the biggest thing that we don't do is in any big way discount our membership. Some of the brochure things that you may sign up for a membership and you get a certain number of coupons related to stuff. I don't want to go into that, but you can look at our competitors and see what they do. There's a lot more promotional activity going on elsewhere. And we're still getting, as I mentioned on the call, year over year 7% increase in new memberships with about just under a 3% increase in number of new warehouses. So we're still getting people indoor. I think in fairness, that's been helped by COVID. We being warehouse clubs was a big cavernous place to come and get a lot of things, and that certainly helped us. I'd like to think we're pretty good at what we do, and that's why more people are signing up, and we're opening new units and driving more business that way. But really, we have not done -- if anything, we've done a little less on the promotional side in membership. We do a few promotional things each year, but not a lot. I'm going to take one more question. They're doing great. End of story. We've been blessed by those first openings that we have over there. Needless to say, we were impacted, like everybody over there, during the shutdown and what have you. And we had some great video clips in our budget meetings here showing what we did to create care packages not only for our members but for the neighborhoods around us. And we were told they were the best care packages of any of the big retailers, so that made us feel good. I have one of my colleagues here on the merchandising side, and she was saying to me softly the negatives are getting better. And again, it's about seven or eight months ago, seven-ish months ago, when we started seeing the decline. And so, if nothing else, we'll be having an easier compare five months, hence. But certainly, we've seen a little bit of improvement in the negatives. Well, thank you, everyone. David, Josh and I are around to answer questions if you have any more, which I'm sure you will. Have a good afternoon."

        "content": "Operator: Good day. My name is Emma, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Costco Wholesale Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference call. [Operator Instructions] Richard Galanti, CFO, you may begin your conference.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you, Emma, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are being made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the second quarter of fiscal '23, the 12 weeks ended this past February 12, as well as February retail sales for the 4 weeks ended this past Sunday, February 26. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $1.466 billion or $3.30 per share compared to $1.299 billion or $2.92 per diluted share last year, an increase of 13%. In terms of sales, net sales for the second quarter increased 6.5% to $54.24 billion compared to $50.94 billion reported a year ago in the second quarter. Our comparable sales for the second quarter were as follows: in the U.S., 5.7% for the 12-week period, excluding gas inflation, 5.8%; Canada, 3.5% reported and 9.6% excluding gas inflation and FX; Other International, 3.8% reported and 9.5% ex gas inflation and FX; for Total Company, 5.2% reported and 6.8% excluding gas inflation and FX; e-commerce was minus 9.6% for the 12 weeks reported and minus 8.7% excluding FX. In terms of second quarter comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 5% worldwide and 3.7% in the United States. Our average transaction or ticket was up 0.2% worldwide and up 1.9% in the U.S. during Q2. Foreign currencies relative to the dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 1.8%, and gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales very slightly by approximately 0.2%. I'll review our February sales results later in the call. Next on the income statement is membership fee income. Reported in the second quarter, $1.027 billion of membership fee income or 1.89%. That's for this year's second quarter compared to $967 million a year earlier, so a $60 million increase in dollars or up 6.2%. Excluding the headwinds in FX, the $60 million increase would have been higher by additional $20 million. So on an FX-adjusted basis, membership fee income was up just over 8 percentage points. In terms of renewal rates, at second quarter end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate was 92.6%, up 0.01% from Q1 end, and worldwide rate came in at 90.5%, also up 0.01% from the prior quarter, both represent all-time highs. Membership growth has remained strong. We ended the second quarter with 68.1 million paid household members and 123.0 million cardholders, both up more than 7% versus a year earlier. At Q2 end, we had 30.6 million paid executive memberships. This is an increase during the 12-week quarter of 630,000 members since Q1 end. Executive members now represent 45% of paid members and about 73% of worldwide sales. Moving down the income statement, next is our gross margin. On a reported basis, gross margin was higher year-over-year by 8 basis points, coming in at 10.72% as a percent of sales as compared to a year earlier second quarter at 10.64%. Now the 8 basis points up, and then excluding gas inflation, have been up 9 basis points. As I always ask you to draw a little chart with 2 columns, reported and excluding gas inflation, and then we'll go down the line items. Core merchandise was minus 6 basis points reported and also minus 6 ex gas inflation. Ancillary businesses were plus 2 and plus 3 basis points year-over-year; 2% reward, minus 2 and minus 2 basis points. LIFO, since we had a charge last year and nothing this fiscal quarter, it was plus 14 and plus 14. For total, again, reported, 8 basis points up year-over-year; and ex gas inflation, up 9 basis points. Starting with the core. Our core merchandise gross margin again was lower by 6 basis points year-over-year. In terms of core margin on their own sales, our core-on-core margin, if you will, it was lower year-over-year by 26 basis points. Most major departments in general were down, with fresh foods being down a little more than others. We're continuing to hold or drop prices where we can to drive traffic and improve our competitive advantage. Overall, core sales benefited from sales shifting from ancillary and other businesses to core. Ancillary and other businesses gross margins again were higher by 2 and 3 basis points ex gas in the quarter. Gas business centers and travel were better year-over-year, offset in part by e-com and pharmacy. 2% Reward lower by 2 basis points, that's reflective of the higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. LIFO, as I mentioned, was a year-over-year variance of plus 14 basis points. We had no LIFO charge this fiscal quarter compared to a $71 million charge in Q2 last year. Moving on to expenses, SG&A. Our reported SG&A for the second quarter was higher year-over-year by 13 basis points. This year, it was 9.11% compared to 8.98% in the second quarter of last fiscal year. Jotting down some numbers for the 2 columns, first column being reported; the second, ex gas inflation. Operations was down -- higher, I said, minus 2 basis points -- higher by 2 basis points, so minus 2 and minus 2; central, minus 9 and minus 9, so higher year-over-year in central by 9 basis points; stock compensation, minus 2 and minus 2; and then all told, that would be 13 basis points higher, both on a reported basis and ex gas inflation. The core operations component of SG&A, again, higher by 2 basis points and also higher by 2 ex inflation. This includes the wage and benefits increases implemented last March and last year's third fiscal quarter and an additional top-of-scale wage increase that went into effect July 4, which was in our fourth quarter of last year. Central, as I mentioned, was higher by 9 basis points year-over-year. About half of this increase is a charge related to a tax audit covering several prior years. Stock comp pretty much as expected, just a couple of basis points. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $34 million this year, $2 million lower than the $36 million figure in Q2 of last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $89 million year-over-year. This was driven by an increase in interest income due to both higher interest rates being earned and on higher cash balances. The increase in interest income was slightly offset by unfavorable FX. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the second quarter was 26.1%, down slightly from the 26.7% figure in Q2 last year. The effective rate for the year, excluding discrete items, continues to be projected in the 26% to 27% range. Overall, net income was up about 13%. In terms of a few other items of note, warehouse expansion. In the second quarter, we opened 3 net new warehouses, 2 in the U.S. and 1 in Australia. Additionally, next week, we'll open our third warehouse in China, with our fourth and fifth China new openings scheduled to open in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, so a total of 3 this fiscal year in China. In fiscal '23, we expect to open a total of 27 warehouses, including 3 relocations, so a net increase of 24 new warehouses. These 24 planned new openings are made up of 14 in the U.S. and 10 in Other International. The 10 in Other International includes the 3 in China, along with our first Costcos in each of New Zealand and Sweden, both of which were opened during the fiscal first quarter. Regarding capital expenditures, our second quarter fiscal '23 capital spend was approximately $900 million. Our estimate for the year remains in the range of $3.8 billion to $4.2 billion based on timing. In terms of e-commerce, as I mentioned, e-commerce sales in Q2, ex FX decreased 8.7%. This weakness was driven mostly by our online mix of sales. Big-ticket discretionary departments like majors, home furnishings, small electrics, jewelry, hardware, these were down 15% in the quarter and make up 58% of our e-com sales. These same departments, by the way, were down 11% in warehouse but only make up 8% of total warehouse in-line sales. Now a few comments regarding inflation. It continues to seem to improve somewhat. Recall, back in the fourth fiscal quarter, which ended last August, our estimated year-over-year price inflation was 8% for that prior fiscal year. During Q1, the estimate on a year-over-year basis came down to 6% to 7%. In Q2, we estimate that the equivalent year-over-year inflation number has come down to 5% to 6% range and even a little lower than that towards the end of the quarter, according to the buyers. We continue to see some improvements in many items. Commodity prices are starting to fall not back to pre-COVID levels and some examples but continue to provide some relief with things like chicken, bacon, butter, steel, resin, nuts. Switching over to our inventory levels. Again, both in Q3 and Q4 fiscal year-ends in fiscal '22, on a year-over-year basis, our inventories were up 26% year-over-year. And then in our first quarter of this year, they were up 10%, so good improvement there. As of this quarter end, our inventory year-over-year as of the end of Q2 was down 2% year-over-year. Regarding the 2% drop, we were a bit over-inventoried last year as a result of supply chain challenges, causing inventory to be backed up at the ports. And talking to the buyers a year ago, their estimate of just timing of getting things across the ocean was 70-plus days. Today, it's back down to 30-ish days. And so supply chain improvement across the board and rates, of course, coming down. Now turning now to our February sales, the 4 weeks ended this past Sunday, February 26. As reported in our release, net sales for the month were $17.06 billion, an increase of 4.7% from $16.29 billion a year earlier in the month of February. Recall from January sales results that the Lunar New Year, Chinese New Year occurred on January 22 this year, 10 days earlier this year. The shift positively impacted February's Other International by about 2% and Total Company by about 0.25%. Additionally, February's results for both the U.S. and Total Company were negatively impacted by approximately 1%, we estimate, as a result of substantially worse weather this year over year. I believe most of that was on the traffic side rather than ticket side. Same-store sales, again in the release, on the U.S., as reported, 3.4%; ex gas, 3.5%; Canada reported, 1.2; ex gas and FX, 7.3%; Other International, 6.5% reported; ex gas and FX, plus 11.5%; Total Company, 3.5% reported; ex-gas and FX was 5.0%; in terms of e-com, minus 11.2% reported compared to a minus 10.3% without FX. That's actually an improvement from our January e-com results. Our comp traffic or frequency in February was up 4.9% worldwide and 3.1% in the U.S. Foreign currencies year-over-year relative to the dollar negatively impacted total and comparable sales as follows: Canada, been impacted by 5.5 percentage points, Other International by approximately 5.7% and Total Company by approximately 1.5%. Gasoline prices were essentially flat year-over-year, ever so slightly inflationary, but essentially flat. Worldwide, the average transaction for February was down 1.3%, including the negative impact from FX that I just mentioned. In terms of regional and merchandising categories, general highlights for February that we normally do in this monthly sales call. The U.S. regions with the strongest comp sales were the Midwest, the Northeast and the Southeast. In terms of Other International, in local currencies, we saw the strongest results in Spain, U.K. and Mexico. Year-over-year inflation for food and sundries and fresh foods, while still elevated, were at their lowest levels in nearly a year, with food and sundries inflation dropping to the high single digits and fresh foods to the low to mid-single digits. Moving to merchandise highlights. The following comparable sales results by category for the month excludes the negative impact from foreign exchange. Food and sundries were positive low double digits. Cooler, food and sundries were the strongest. Fresh foods were up mid-single digits. Better-performing departments included bakery and meat. Non-foods were negative mid-single digits. Better-performing departments included tires, health and beauty aids and apparel. Majors, which were electronics and big-ticket electronics items, jewelry, housewares, domestics and small appliances and hardware were the worse performers, consistent with Q2 overall. Ancillary businesses sales were up mid-single digits. Food court, hearing aid and pharmacy were the top performers there. Finally, in terms of upcoming earnings and sales releases, we will announce our March sales results for the 5 weeks ending Sunday, April 2, on the following Wednesday, April 5, after market close. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back over to Emma for questions and answers. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: I guess, sizing up the consumer, I want to see how you view February in, I guess, the continuum of months. And then part of it, I think you said down mid-teens with some of those e-commerce categories. Thanks for that information. Is that stable? Is that worse? How do you kind of diagnose the whole consumer in the business?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think as we talked about even the last 12 weeks ago, in the quarterly numbers, we've seen some weakness in what I'll call big-ticket discretionary items. I'm not an economist, but I think it's a combination of the economy and concerns out there as well as particularly strong numbers that we enjoyed not only a year ago but a year prior to that with COVID that we, of course, benefited in big ways with those big-ticket items. So all those things, I think, reflect that in those numbers. There's just a couple of weeks in a couple of regions where we started to set out some seasonal things for spring and summer. So far, so good, but it's literally small data points in small parts of the country where the weather has been a little better, which is not a lot of places. But anecdotally, some comments were made on things like even some water sports items and camping equipment. But it's a small data set. So we'll cross our fingers and hope to see. But overall, units are generally fine. I mean there's some things still with like, on the computer side, there's weakness overall, not just with us. I think I mentioned this on the first quarter call, we're seeing decent sales in units of televisions while the average selling price points have come down. I think it's just in the next couple of weeks where the new TVs for the upcoming season are coming out. But other than that, what we look at, of course, our average transactions or shopping frequency is up. Our new sign-ups are continuing to be strong, up 7% in terms of new sign-ups on less than 3% new openings. So those things bode well, but people certainly are spending their dollars where they feel they should be spending them. And so we'll see where it goes from here.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. A follow-up on EBIT growth, I know you don't guide, but this business has averaged, I think, about high single or maybe around 10% over time. This year, it's a little below average because of some of the lapping and you are lapping some great fuel gross profit. Curious of the puts and the takes. So whatever number that you expect the EBIT dollars of this business to grow, are you confident in the levers that you have to get there?\nRichard Galanti: Well, look, we feel good about what we're doing in driving business in the right way and growing our business. As you and others have heard forever, we're a top line company. While I can't give guidance, certainly, we and everybody who has cash benefit from earning more money on their cash right now. As we saw in this quarter, there was a $70 million improvement in year-over-year comparison of gross margin simply because of LIFO. We can't predict what's going to happen, at least the trends yesterday were that we're starting to see some improvement in inflation. To the extent that continues, we're comparing to LIFO charges in excess of $100 million and $200 million in each of Q3 and Q4. So that's something that we look at as well. Gas is volatile, no pun intended, and it's been quite profitable in some quarters more than others. But we think that we've got the different levers and puts and takes, if you will, to do that. But ultimately, it's about driving sales. And certainly, we know we're getting the customer in. We're getting more of them in and they're, again, renewing at the highest rate ever. So we'll go through this as good, if not better, than others.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser: So Richard, last time there was an economic downturn in the United States and globally, Costco performed pretty well, was able to comp positive during that time. This turnaround, it's a much bigger business, and it might exhibit more economic sensitivity. So a, is that how you're thinking about it? And b, what actions would Costco take to preserve its profitability in the event that it saw negative comps in the coming quarters?\nRichard Galanti: Well, we're going to do things that drive market share, first and foremost. We are certainly cognizant of the bottom line. And I think this quarter is a good example of that. But at the same token, we're going to do what we need to do to drive sales because long term, when we get our customer in and they buy stuff, they're going to come back and buy more stuff. And we've always done a good job of that. Again, this one is a little different, this economic downturn, with the rising interest rates and the headlines of recession and high interest rates. But that being said, I think we're fortunate in the sense that we've got a multitude, various types of businesses within our business from big ticket discretionary items to food and sundries and health and beauty aids and fresh foods, which is really driving the cart right now more so than it has in the past. So we'll continue to do what we do. I remember years ago, someone asked about if sales were slowing down, what would we do. And we said we'd drive more sales by being even hotter on prices. But generally, that's worked for us, and I see that equation continuing.\nMichael Lasser: And a follow-up question is, to your point, the inflationary number that you cited are lower than what others are experiencing. So presumably, your price gaps are widening, which makes sense and you're delivering more value for your member at a time where they arguably need it. And with that being said, how does the fact that you are delivering more value to your consumer and then maybe somewhat pressured play into your mindset around whether or not you would raise your fess? I believe this spring would be the 5-year anniversary of the last time you raised your fees and you typically do it around this time.\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Actually, June would be our sixth anniversary. As I mentioned in the previous calls, looking at the last, I think, 3, they averaged around 5 years and 7 months, which is about now or last month. And what we said over the last few quarters is that, in our view, it's a question of when, not if. And so we'll let you know. But keep in mind, that's one way that we become even more competitive. We take those monies and directly become even more competitive. I might add though, our locations do weekly comp shops of 100 to 150 key items, all directly competitive items, and then a variety of other against our direct competitors and other limited comp shops against other forms of traditional retail where the gap of competitiveness is much greater. But at the end of the day, our relative level of competitiveness, in our view, is as strong as it's ever been. And we do that weekly in locations. And every 4-week, monthly 2-day budget meeting, each of the regional operations' senior executives get up and show those numbers. And you can rest assure we're going to continue to do that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.\nChristopher Horvers: So following up on the first question, I guess, relative to the last time that you spoke to us, do you think the consumers deteriorated at all? Anything that you're seeing on what they're buying, how price sensitive, private label, income demographic? What are your observations around the rate of change for the consumer?\nRichard Galanti: Not terribly different than a quarter ago or probably in David's January sales recording. So again, it all centers around big-ticket discretionary. And we look at that and we look at how it compared to a year ago and then 2 years ago. We had so much strength there not only with COVID and people buying big-ticket stuff, now the economy and the interest rates, so that's to be expected. Again, we kind of go phew, our strength in food and sundries and fresh foods and health and beauty aids and things like that help to counter some of that. One interesting comment that I think I haven't made in the past, we've been asked that during this concern about inflation and people trading down, have we seen any delta in the sales penetration of our own Kirkland Signature items. And of course, my first comment is that's a trade up or a trade equal, not a trade down. But at the end of the day, we have seen actually, in the last few months, a bigger delta than normal. I'd say over the last 10 years, we see 0.5% or a little less than 0.5% a year of increased penetration. For this quarter year-over-year, we're seen a little over 1.5 percentage point increase in sales penetration on the food side, foods being anything packaged or dry or wet, you name it. And so we have seen a little bit of an increase in that. I guess that's consistent with the concession that most people are looking to save money. And of course, if it's our brand, that's great. That creates loyalty.\nChristopher Horvers: Yes. And then on the pricing/LIFO point, last quarter, you talked about like we could have a LIFO benefit and that could be a source of funds in terms of investing in price. So a two-part question, if prices stayed here today, would we essentially get back the LIFO headwinds that you had a year ago as we think about going forward? And then the second question is, you mentioned your price gaps are as good as they've ever been but, at the same time, there was some change in consumer. So should we think about that LIFO as a source of funds to further invest in price?\nRichard Galanti: I was looking at it more not as a source of funds but more as -- look, to the extent that, and this is just using this as an example, if there was no LIFO charge plus or minus in Q3 and Q4, on a year-over-year comparison, you have, on a pretax basis, $130 million positive delta and a $223 million positive delta. Those are nice numbers to have a positive delta. So from a standpoint of looking at the earlier question about are we cognizant of earnings growth, if you will, or reported earnings per share, part of that plays into that, that gives us a little bit of cushion there as does gasoline from time to time, as does, first and foremost, stronger sales. So all those things play into that. I think generally speaking, we're still going to do what's right, in our view, to drive sales. That's what we want to do, first and foremost. And to the extent that, that example occur in Q3 and Q4, that gives us a little room to do that without even thinking about it.\nChristopher Horvers: And then just from the accounting perspective, should we automatically get that back if prices stay at these levels on the lap?\nRichard Galanti: If the lapping stays at 0, yes, there would be no new charge, so it would be comparing to a charge last year. To the extent that, yes, prices were to go down relative to a year ago, you'd actually have a LIFO credit, which would be even a bigger year-over-year delta.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.\nCharles Grom: Richard, just curious if you could talk about the gas business from a competitive standpoint and how that's changed bigger picture over the years and then, more recently, how gas balance have trended.\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Gas has been a relative blessing as well. It's a profitable business. It is volatilely profitable. Sometimes it's more. And sometimes, it's less. But overall, it's a profitable business. It's given us an additional competitive advantage of getting people in the door, if you will. I think it was this last summer into early fall where I've given some numbers where our gallon sales increases in the U.S. were up in the mid- to high teens compared to darn near flat for the U.S. population as a whole. I announced yesterday on that, and I think that 15-plus percent delta of us versus the U.S. population is still about 10 percentage points. And so we are still taking market share, if you will, and getting people in the parking lot. And in terms of value, we look at a value compared to average value across our locations where we do comp shops, in some cases, every day in many locations. This year, to date, I'm looking at single-digit number, we feel that we saved a member $0.37. That's an improvement. Over the last 5 years, it's gone from the mid-20s to the mid-30s.\nCharles Grom: Okay. That's helpful context. And then just on the inflation, just as prices have started to come down and as you've invested in price, too, curious what you've seen from a demand perspective and how you're measuring the success of some of those price actions that you appear to be taking?\nRichard Galanti: Well, it's an art, not a science. We'll look at high-velocity items where we can make a big difference, pass on some items. On some things, I mean this is just anecdotal because it was from our last budget meeting, with shipping costs coming dramatically down, on a 25- and 50-pound bags of jasmine rice, we've seen a big uptick in sales because that's an item that really skyrocketed because it's per pound, based on the size of the bag, it was a heavy freight cost. And so as that comes down, we see that going. I think we're doing more with our suppliers, changing things around with the MVM. Part of that's based on allocation issues of what we have. But overall, no, we're firm believer of if you improve the value by lowering the price, you're going to drive more sales.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities.\nScot Ciccarelli: So you guys, like many others, have seen a shift away from a bunch of discretionary categories, probably stronger sales strength in the consumable category. But gross margins are actually pretty stable. So I guess the question is, should we start to expect more gross margin pressure on a go-forward basis if we were to kind of see that mix shift continue to lean towards kind of food and consumables?\nRichard Galanti: Frankly, the delta between those various categories are not as extreme as they used to be. And in fact, in things like fresh foods and food and sundries, some of the weaker categories -- not weaker, but lower-margin categories -- are things like big-ticket discretionary items. We make a smaller percentage, more dollars per unit, of course, but a smaller percentage on big-ticket electronics. And so that impacts more the gross margin dollars than the percentages there. If anything, if you go do a little homework on what the cost of processing and selling a rotisserie chicken, our $4.99 price, which we maintain, is an investment in low prices to drive membership, to drive the sales in a big way. So there are some things that we do, notwithstanding huge inflation. And even though some of the costs have come down a little bit, relatively speaking, we want those wow items in there as well.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. And then one follow-up here, you guys have obviously done a couple of onetime dividends over the years, but that was always in a really low interest rate environment. And as you guys just reported with your net interest income, you can actually generate some real returns on your cash now. So I guess the question is, does the higher risk-free interest rate environment actually discourage you from returning that capital through future dividends?\nRichard Galanti: Well, it helps a little right now. So that's good news. I don't think it changes our view that the special dividend, which we've done over the last 10.5 years, I think, it's still an arrow in our quiver. And at some point, it's something you might see again. But I'm not trying to be cute, it's kind of like the membership question, we'll let you know when we do it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Credit Suisse.\nKaren Short: So Richard, you made a comment that you're particularly cognizant of the bottom line. I think it was your exact commentary. So I'm wondering if you can triangulate that with what you think net or pretax margin numbers should look like on a go-forward basis but also triangulate that with the fact that you also commented that you're looking to invest in price to gain share in various categories.\nRichard Galanti: Sure. Well, I think on the latter comment, we're looking to use price to gain share, we're continuing to do that. It's not like we're going to go do more or less. I mean that's what we do for a living. What I was trying to say in the comment, that being we're particularly cognizant to the bottom line, we are a public for-profit company, and our shareholders want to know what we're doing. There have been times, for those of you that have followed us for many years, when we might take a bigger hit on some expense in a given quarter. I think, in fact, many years ago, it was the rotisserie chicken example that we, frankly, I think, have more levers today to adjust things, which helps us. But we're not going to get away from those 2 things, driving the top line and being cognizant that we're also a public company trying to earn money for our shareholders. But we're going to prioritize driving sales because that will benefit all the other things on the income statement.\nKaren Short: Okay. And then just on inventory, just obviously, inventory down meaningfully, but any thoughts on how to think about inventory going forward relative to sales given that it was down 2.5%? And I'm not sure how much of that was gas or fuel related, so maybe if you can parse out that relative to ex fuel commentary.\nRichard Galanti: Yes. By the way, gasoline inventory is very small relative to everything else. And it turns darn near daily. But a lot of the improvement or reduction in inventory year-over-year was all the stuff backed up with the supply chain challenges and the port challenges a year ago. So we feel we're in good inventory shape. The flow is much better. There's always going to be anecdotal examples of stuff, we have a little too much of something or a little too less, but we feel pretty good right now about our inventory levels even by category. There's a few categories, a little over a few categories under, but nothing like when we were 26% up and had a lot of, what I'll call, in-transit stuff literally on those pictures that you saw on the news, of the ports, on the ships. And so that's improved a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen.\nThomas Nass: It's Tom on for Oliver. On digital, can you guys add some color as to how comps are expected to trend in the near term just given the easing compares in the back half of the year? And additionally, what opportunities lie ahead in terms of digital business from an engagement point of view?\nRichard Galanti: Well, we don't project where we're going. But I was glad at least that February, while negative, was a little better than January. We've got additional marketing activities that we've got going on there. We did hire just 5 months ago a new Head of Digital that is in the process of doing a lot of things. So there'll be more to report over the next several quarters. In my view, there's a lot of opportunities and low hanging fruit to do that. The biggest thing, the challenge that we've had, just looking at our current numbers, was that we've been so successful over the last 2 years. Not only did COVID drive huge business on big-ticket things for home, be it furniture, electronics, televisions, you name it, computers, and also the acquisition a couple of years ago or 3 years ago of what's now called Costco Logistics, those 2 things drove that business in such a big way. We recognize that's part of it. But we're not hanging our hat on that, we want to grow the sales.\nThomas Nass: Great. And as a follow-up on the executive memberships, with the higher penetration there, could you just talk about how those members behave relatively, and additionally, the effects on the business from that higher penetration?\nRichard Galanti: Well, they're more loyal, they spend more and they come more frequently. It's only good stuff. So look, at the end of the day, if we can get somebody to, in the U.S. as an example, spend $120 instead of $60 at the current rates, and with that, they get the 2% Reward with some other benefits on certain consequential transactions, that definitely drives loyalty and drive frequency. And so the executive member spends more and shops more. And then if we get them also to get the co-branded Citi Visa card, it's even better than that. So all those things work, in our view, in a positive direction. And so we like the fact that the executive membership penetration helped. We've said in the last couple of years, we brought it into a few other smaller countries. You need a core base of 15 or so locations to do it. And so we've provided it in other locations as well. But we're still seeing increased penetration in the U.S. of that. We do a better job, by the way, when somebody new comes in to sign up, getting them to sign up, we do a better job of explaining the benefits of an executive membership than we did years ago as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO.\nKelly Bania: I'm going to venture to ask a margin question here. The core-on-core has been down for about 8 quarters in a row, I believe. I was just wondering if you could help us understand the thought process in managing the core margin in that way? And I guess, particularly given your comment that some of the low-margin categories like big ticket are under a little bit more pressure, so maybe even a little bit more surprising, is it just the way that other mix is shaking out? Is this intentionally? Are you reinvesting any of the maybe gas windfall that we've had over the past several quarters? Are you investing that back into the store? Maybe just help us understand the thought process in this core-on-core decline here.\nRichard Galanti: Yes. I think the biggest component of the answer to that question is our fresh margins have been the biggest piece of that coming down. And looking at it, our fresh margin in Q2 compared to Q2 3 years ago, pre-COVID, we're still up about 50, 60 basis points. Now we were up a lot more than that because of all the things that COVID did. It drove tremendous sales growth in those areas, which created less spoilage, which is a proponent of cost of sales in fresh foods, and labor productivity in places like the bakery and the meat department. And so it was, if you will, outsized improvement. We're still better than we were pre-COVID. And we've maintained the sales. These are not real numbers, I don't have them in front of me, but let's make them up and say that fresh pre-COVID was going up 8% or 10% a year, 8% a year or whatever it was, and then we enjoyed a couple of years of 20-plus percent, I believe. And now we're still doing fine with sales growth, not up to 8% or 10%, but nonetheless, it's still a positive. And so we've kept all those outsized gains. But we've also, of late, not just the last month or 2 but over the last several months, have invested in pricing. And certainly, fresh helps drive that. And I gave the example of the rotisserie chicken, but that goes through lots of areas of fresh foods where that's one of the key categories that people come in to shop for.\nKelly Bania: And are you thinking of managing that in a way to get back to kind of pre-COVID levels? Or would you let that run a little above for some period of time?\nRichard Galanti: I don't think we're smart enough to know how to manage all these things. There's so many different components of what is the gross margin from the different core departments to the ancillary businesses, to gas, to LIFO now. So it really is fluid. And we do manage it, but it's managing it in an organized, chaotic way sometimes, too, as things change every day. I think we do a great job of doing it.\nKelly Bania: No, agreed. Agreed. Just, I guess, following up on the LIFO as it relates to the margin, you gave out some of the numbers in terms of the dollars in the last couple of quarters. In order of magnitude, would those kind of offset some of the gas margin tailwinds? Is that the way to think about it? Or would the GAAP margin tailwind be bigger or smaller than those LIFO charges?\nRichard Galanti: Sometimes, in a given month even, it can be bigger or smaller, honestly. I mean gas fluctuates quite a bit. But good try on asking.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore.\nGregory Melich: A couple of questions. One, I hate to go back to the membership fee, but it just seems right. The $120 executive price point, now that that's, what, 43% of members and 70-some percent of sales, does the fact that that's where the bulk of the sales are coming from change the thought process in terms of how you might do the timing of the membership?\nRichard Galanti: No. Not at all.\nGregory Melich: Not at all. Great. And then second is on items in basket, trying to figure out how as comps slow, and I imagine you're still getting that wage inflation, SG&A doesn't delever more, why is that? If traffic's still growing and we have inflation, is it just because items per basket are down? Or how do we think about managing the SG&A dollar growth in this not deflationary but disinflationary environment?\nRichard Galanti: Yes, units are still up. And frankly, price inflation offsets it a little bit, it helps offset it a little bit, and I think the focus on trying to keep figuring out how to do things more efficiently. One of the things that, again, that we do religiously every 4 weeks at the budget meeting is the operators are talking about certain focus items, whether it's improving overtime hours or things we've done to automate something, physically improve the flow of goods in a warehouse. We've done a pretty good job of that. And we've done that notwithstanding to off-season wage increases this year, 3 off-season wage increases, if you go back, I think, over the last 15 months. So our leverage there and a very slight deleverage is pretty impressive given that labor benefits is our single biggest expense category. So it's productivity. And I think we've continued to do a good job with that.\nGregory Melich: And just so I'm getting the math right on the comp, if the comp is running 6 and inflation is running 6, but traffic is up 3, then items in basket would be down 3?\nRichard Galanti: It's mix. Yes, it's mix.\nGregory Melich: It's 100% ASP. Got it. All right. That great. Good luck.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.\nJohn Heinbockel: Richard, I want to start with I know you guys have begun doing a lot more data analytic work, and you talked about maybe investing in price. Have you done much work on price elasticity by category or item? And you think in the context of non-foods is where there is softness, right, it's not consumables. What can you do mid-course correction there, right, on nonfood? Is there elasticity where you can drive some share early in season by making targeted investments in those categories?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think there are, and we do. We don't analyze, frankly, the price elasticity on a historical basis other than we know what works in the past and we keep doing it more. It's pretty straightforward. But we're not doing A/B tests or test let's take this price delta in this region, down x or up only y; in a different region, see which one works better. We're pretty singularly focused on if we lower the price, we'll do more sales.\nJohn Heinbockel: All right. And then to follow up on that, right, so again, you think about nonfood, you said maybe nonfood is going to be a little weaker. And it's not all nonfood, right, it's certain categories. Have you dialed back inventory? Do you want to get product -- you get it in early anyway. I'm not sure you can get in any earlier. What do you do, if anything, I guess, inventory would be the biggest thing?\nRichard Galanti: Well, first and foremost, is being in stock, and to the extent that we bring in a few things early. I think the anecdotal comment I mentioned about water sports and camping, we brought that a little earlier because we had some room. And there's parts of the country, there's no sense bringing in some of that stuff early given the weather right now. But at the end of the day, I think we've always done a pretty good job of that as well. The big thing is working with the suppliers. Using electronics as an example, these are anecdotal stories, but while sales were very strong for 2 years during COVID and supply chain challenges were still there, there was virtually no promotional things. There's now more promotional. Our buyers are out there making sure that we're getting every promotional penny that's out there and being on top of that with our suppliers. That's part of what we do. But that's been more of a focus. Yes, we focus on the categories that are growing. Examples would be like HABA and apparel, which are very strong for us right now. Part of apparel's strength is getting more well-known stuff in.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi.\nBrandon Cheatham: This is Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. I want to go back to your comments on wider price gaps. It sounds like you're managing the business just kind of how you always have. But your price gaps are wider than they ever have been. So I'm just wondering like how has your competitors' behavior changed? Are there certain categories that they're not responding to? Or are they responding slower than they have in the past?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think I said that they're as wide as they've ever been. I don't know if they've gotten wider. But we feel very good about where they are. And this is against direct competitors or other large boxes on certain categories, recognizing when it's a traditional retailer, there's a much bigger price gap to start with. And I'll remind you also, despite the fact that we and another warehouse club essentially sell the same types of items, we want to make sure that on exact like-branded items, we're better priced. So on those $100 million, $150 million, that's where we look at that. They're the most competitive, whether it's Coke and Pepsi or Advil or Tide detergent or key items that everybody knows the price of or is that same item. There are plenty of items that are differing in quantity, quality, size, color, you name it, where we feel that, in some cases, we have a better value. But that's up to the customer to behold that. And so we just keep doing what we're doing. We're focusing on those competitive items and constantly figuring out how to drive more value in any item we do. How do we, especially private label, but how do we upsize the pack while improving the price per unit within the pack? Even when there was big inflation, if there was a 10% increase, inflationary cost increase in something, how do we get the vendor to eat a little of it, will eat a little of it? Needless to say that still the majority of that increase is going to be in the price, but how do we also, beyond that, from a manufacturing standpoint and a packaging standpoint, how do we lower the price by a few extra percentage points by figuring out how to get x percent more cell units on a pallet by changing the configuration of the pack size. We focus more on that than anybody I know because we're taking our $230 billion or $240 billion in sales and dividing it by 3,800 items. So we have many items that are $50 million, $100 million, $300 million, $500 million items. And when we can do that, we think that we do a good job of that.\nBrandon Cheatham: So that's to say, I mean, you think that you've got maybe a little bit of a cost advantage over your competitors, so they're not able to quite match you when you make moves like this.\nRichard Galanti: I'm sorry, what was that?\nBrandon Cheatham: You have a cost advantage, a little bit of a cost advantage, compared to your competitors. When you take prices down, they can't quite match you. And so that's why you're able to get your price gaps as wide as they have been?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think it's our model versus other models. We respect and have very formidable competitors, whether it's other warehouse clubs or big box discounters or supermarkets. And we're all doing what we can do to maximize our own respective model. So I think certainly, when we make some price changes to things, we see our competitors act to them in some cases and not in others. I think the fact that we have fewer items and we're out there every week, I know that our merchants, when they see those comp shops, I'm making this up, that there's 100 items, and we're the same on 50 and lower on 45 and higher on 5, those 5 better be changed this week. And so I know we're on top of it. I can't speak to our competitors, but I assume they are also. But we have a model, a cost structure, that allows us to mark up our goods, on average, in the low teens compared to traditional retailers in the mid-20s to 100. So we have a little room there.\nBrandon Cheatham: Got it. Sam's Club recently announced that they've changed course and start opening doors. I'm wondering, does that impact you at all on your opening plans? Would you locate in the same place even if you knew they'd be opening nearby? Or would that preclude you from the area?\nRichard Galanti: No, we're going to open where we want to open certainly whether it's an existing open location or something that we're aware of based on what's going on in the real estate activity out there, which we all know what everybody is doing in advance in a way. And so does it impact us? It may impact us in some examples, whether it's Sam's or somebody else, to push this one more soon. And look, I was going to say, when you asked about them announcing they're going to open more doors, I think they said they're going to open up about 30 over the next 5 or so years, 5 or 6 years. They apparently didn't get the memo that they should close some more. I'm just kidding. Look, we respect them as a competitor, and we don't see that changing what we do. I think it bodes well, though, that there's plenty of capacity still in this country, of course, other countries, even more so.\nOperator: Your last question today comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital.\nScott Mushkin: I have tons. But I guess the first thing I wanted to ask a little bit, you gave the regional sales kind of which regions were better. I mean, obviously, there's been a lot of layoffs in tech, and you have a huge business out in California. Are you seeing that business underperform relative to just over a couple of month period? That's my first one.\nRichard Galanti: Not really. My guy is here looking at the numbers, and they're saying not really. One of the things that Josh mentioned is, well, we have 400 locations. 400-plus of our 550-ish location in the U.S. have gas, that's even a bigger percentage in California, and higher volume gas units. And with gas inflation coming down dramatically year-over-year, that's partly why they're not the best performers. If you took that out, there's not a whole big difference out there.\nScott Mushkin: And just curious, and maybe this is a silly question, what happens with that gas business, especially in California, with the push to EVs?\nRichard Galanti: It's a long road ahead. We only have 11 carwashes. So we have plenty of room for carwashes 30 years from now. But at the end of the day, we think it's a very long road. It's not happening in the next few years. And the fact that we're still taking such market share relative to U.S. gas gallons in general is a positive. So I think it's a question that we can defer for 5 or 10 years, frankly.\nScott Mushkin: Yes, tell this to the California guy. My last question, I know this call has gone long, just wondering about a little bit long term the initiatives. You had a big push into fresh several years ago. It's obviously worked out really well. We had the credit card. We had the big push in the big ticket. Is there anything on the horizon like that, that will change the business a little bit and maybe grow it a little faster?\nRichard Galanti: Well, international, in general, there's plenty of opportunities. If you look at some of the foreign countries, as a percent of sales, they are more profitable than the U.S. So those things, that creates more opportunity. I don't see anything big right now coming on vertical integration. Might we do another poultry activity at some point, but that's still a few years down the road to even consider. We did a second meat plant outside of Chicago for the Midwest and East Coast just a couple of years ago. We're expanding our bakery commissary. So there's nothing, another couple of hundred million dollar plus projects going on like that. I think another area that I think bodes well for us in terms of competitiveness and continuing to work on getting prices down is working with suppliers, certain things that we currently ship from the U.S., elsewhere, or air freight in the case of produce elsewhere, there's plenty of activity going on what I'll call the hot house side, could you grow more vegetables. But that's all good in concept, but it takes time to figure out. And there's plenty of people trying to figure it out, and so we're waiting for that. The other thing I think I gave an example a few years ago, of something as simple as cashews. Historically, they're all grown and washed and prepped for roasting in Eastern Africa, shipped to America for roasting, quality roasting, packaging and then shipped out to the 13 or 14 countries. Today, those that are ultimately sold in Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Australia and China, are now shipped to Vietnam to a quality roaster supplier of ours. They grew over time with us. And we dramatically lowered the cost on that portion of a huge amount of dollars, and then using that to do what we normally do, take 80% or 90% of that savings and lower the price even further in those countries. There's plenty of opportunities. Now we're now talking with big suppliers of these hundred- and multi-hundred-million dollar items that we buy, whether it's paper goods, plastic items, things like that, which of these items could be produced overseas, particularly on the Asia side, rather than having to produce them here and ship them there. There's a lower cost of production and as long as we can maintain that quality. And so I think there's going to be lots of little opportunities that become, in total, a good opportunity for us.\nRichard Galanti: Well, thank you, everyone. We're around. I'm sure we'll be talking to a few of you today and tomorrow and early next week. Have a good afternoon or evening.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Galanti",
            "content": "Thank you, Emma, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are being made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the second quarter of fiscal '23, the 12 weeks ended this past February 12, as well as February retail sales for the 4 weeks ended this past Sunday, February 26. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $1.466 billion or $3.30 per share compared to $1.299 billion or $2.92 per diluted share last year, an increase of 13%. In terms of sales, net sales for the second quarter increased 6.5% to $54.24 billion compared to $50.94 billion reported a year ago in the second quarter. Our comparable sales for the second quarter were as follows: in the U.S., 5.7% for the 12-week period, excluding gas inflation, 5.8%; Canada, 3.5% reported and 9.6% excluding gas inflation and FX; Other International, 3.8% reported and 9.5% ex gas inflation and FX; for Total Company, 5.2% reported and 6.8% excluding gas inflation and FX; e-commerce was minus 9.6% for the 12 weeks reported and minus 8.7% excluding FX. In terms of second quarter comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 5% worldwide and 3.7% in the United States. Our average transaction or ticket was up 0.2% worldwide and up 1.9% in the U.S. during Q2. Foreign currencies relative to the dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 1.8%, and gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales very slightly by approximately 0.2%. I'll review our February sales results later in the call. Next on the income statement is membership fee income. Reported in the second quarter, $1.027 billion of membership fee income or 1.89%. That's for this year's second quarter compared to $967 million a year earlier, so a $60 million increase in dollars or up 6.2%. Excluding the headwinds in FX, the $60 million increase would have been higher by additional $20 million. So on an FX-adjusted basis, membership fee income was up just over 8 percentage points. In terms of renewal rates, at second quarter end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate was 92.6%, up 0.01% from Q1 end, and worldwide rate came in at 90.5%, also up 0.01% from the prior quarter, both represent all-time highs. Membership growth has remained strong. We ended the second quarter with 68.1 million paid household members and 123.0 million cardholders, both up more than 7% versus a year earlier. At Q2 end, we had 30.6 million paid executive memberships. This is an increase during the 12-week quarter of 630,000 members since Q1 end. Executive members now represent 45% of paid members and about 73% of worldwide sales. Moving down the income statement, next is our gross margin. On a reported basis, gross margin was higher year-over-year by 8 basis points, coming in at 10.72% as a percent of sales as compared to a year earlier second quarter at 10.64%. Now the 8 basis points up, and then excluding gas inflation, have been up 9 basis points. As I always ask you to draw a little chart with 2 columns, reported and excluding gas inflation, and then we'll go down the line items. Core merchandise was minus 6 basis points reported and also minus 6 ex gas inflation. Ancillary businesses were plus 2 and plus 3 basis points year-over-year; 2% reward, minus 2 and minus 2 basis points. LIFO, since we had a charge last year and nothing this fiscal quarter, it was plus 14 and plus 14. For total, again, reported, 8 basis points up year-over-year; and ex gas inflation, up 9 basis points. Starting with the core. Our core merchandise gross margin again was lower by 6 basis points year-over-year. In terms of core margin on their own sales, our core-on-core margin, if you will, it was lower year-over-year by 26 basis points. Most major departments in general were down, with fresh foods being down a little more than others. We're continuing to hold or drop prices where we can to drive traffic and improve our competitive advantage. Overall, core sales benefited from sales shifting from ancillary and other businesses to core. Ancillary and other businesses gross margins again were higher by 2 and 3 basis points ex gas in the quarter. Gas business centers and travel were better year-over-year, offset in part by e-com and pharmacy. 2% Reward lower by 2 basis points, that's reflective of the higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. LIFO, as I mentioned, was a year-over-year variance of plus 14 basis points. We had no LIFO charge this fiscal quarter compared to a $71 million charge in Q2 last year. Moving on to expenses, SG&A. Our reported SG&A for the second quarter was higher year-over-year by 13 basis points. This year, it was 9.11% compared to 8.98% in the second quarter of last fiscal year. Jotting down some numbers for the 2 columns, first column being reported; the second, ex gas inflation. Operations was down -- higher, I said, minus 2 basis points -- higher by 2 basis points, so minus 2 and minus 2; central, minus 9 and minus 9, so higher year-over-year in central by 9 basis points; stock compensation, minus 2 and minus 2; and then all told, that would be 13 basis points higher, both on a reported basis and ex gas inflation. The core operations component of SG&A, again, higher by 2 basis points and also higher by 2 ex inflation. This includes the wage and benefits increases implemented last March and last year's third fiscal quarter and an additional top-of-scale wage increase that went into effect July 4, which was in our fourth quarter of last year. Central, as I mentioned, was higher by 9 basis points year-over-year. About half of this increase is a charge related to a tax audit covering several prior years. Stock comp pretty much as expected, just a couple of basis points. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $34 million this year, $2 million lower than the $36 million figure in Q2 of last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $89 million year-over-year. This was driven by an increase in interest income due to both higher interest rates being earned and on higher cash balances. The increase in interest income was slightly offset by unfavorable FX. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the second quarter was 26.1%, down slightly from the 26.7% figure in Q2 last year. The effective rate for the year, excluding discrete items, continues to be projected in the 26% to 27% range. Overall, net income was up about 13%. In terms of a few other items of note, warehouse expansion. In the second quarter, we opened 3 net new warehouses, 2 in the U.S. and 1 in Australia. Additionally, next week, we'll open our third warehouse in China, with our fourth and fifth China new openings scheduled to open in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, so a total of 3 this fiscal year in China. In fiscal '23, we expect to open a total of 27 warehouses, including 3 relocations, so a net increase of 24 new warehouses. These 24 planned new openings are made up of 14 in the U.S. and 10 in Other International. The 10 in Other International includes the 3 in China, along with our first Costcos in each of New Zealand and Sweden, both of which were opened during the fiscal first quarter. Regarding capital expenditures, our second quarter fiscal '23 capital spend was approximately $900 million. Our estimate for the year remains in the range of $3.8 billion to $4.2 billion based on timing. In terms of e-commerce, as I mentioned, e-commerce sales in Q2, ex FX decreased 8.7%. This weakness was driven mostly by our online mix of sales. Big-ticket discretionary departments like majors, home furnishings, small electrics, jewelry, hardware, these were down 15% in the quarter and make up 58% of our e-com sales. These same departments, by the way, were down 11% in warehouse but only make up 8% of total warehouse in-line sales. Now a few comments regarding inflation. It continues to seem to improve somewhat. Recall, back in the fourth fiscal quarter, which ended last August, our estimated year-over-year price inflation was 8% for that prior fiscal year. During Q1, the estimate on a year-over-year basis came down to 6% to 7%. In Q2, we estimate that the equivalent year-over-year inflation number has come down to 5% to 6% range and even a little lower than that towards the end of the quarter, according to the buyers. We continue to see some improvements in many items. Commodity prices are starting to fall not back to pre-COVID levels and some examples but continue to provide some relief with things like chicken, bacon, butter, steel, resin, nuts. Switching over to our inventory levels. Again, both in Q3 and Q4 fiscal year-ends in fiscal '22, on a year-over-year basis, our inventories were up 26% year-over-year. And then in our first quarter of this year, they were up 10%, so good improvement there. As of this quarter end, our inventory year-over-year as of the end of Q2 was down 2% year-over-year. Regarding the 2% drop, we were a bit over-inventoried last year as a result of supply chain challenges, causing inventory to be backed up at the ports. And talking to the buyers a year ago, their estimate of just timing of getting things across the ocean was 70-plus days. Today, it's back down to 30-ish days. And so supply chain improvement across the board and rates, of course, coming down. Now turning now to our February sales, the 4 weeks ended this past Sunday, February 26. As reported in our release, net sales for the month were $17.06 billion, an increase of 4.7% from $16.29 billion a year earlier in the month of February. Recall from January sales results that the Lunar New Year, Chinese New Year occurred on January 22 this year, 10 days earlier this year. The shift positively impacted February's Other International by about 2% and Total Company by about 0.25%. Additionally, February's results for both the U.S. and Total Company were negatively impacted by approximately 1%, we estimate, as a result of substantially worse weather this year over year. I believe most of that was on the traffic side rather than ticket side. Same-store sales, again in the release, on the U.S., as reported, 3.4%; ex gas, 3.5%; Canada reported, 1.2; ex gas and FX, 7.3%; Other International, 6.5% reported; ex gas and FX, plus 11.5%; Total Company, 3.5% reported; ex-gas and FX was 5.0%; in terms of e-com, minus 11.2% reported compared to a minus 10.3% without FX. That's actually an improvement from our January e-com results. Our comp traffic or frequency in February was up 4.9% worldwide and 3.1% in the U.S. Foreign currencies year-over-year relative to the dollar negatively impacted total and comparable sales as follows: Canada, been impacted by 5.5 percentage points, Other International by approximately 5.7% and Total Company by approximately 1.5%. Gasoline prices were essentially flat year-over-year, ever so slightly inflationary, but essentially flat. Worldwide, the average transaction for February was down 1.3%, including the negative impact from FX that I just mentioned. In terms of regional and merchandising categories, general highlights for February that we normally do in this monthly sales call. The U.S. regions with the strongest comp sales were the Midwest, the Northeast and the Southeast. In terms of Other International, in local currencies, we saw the strongest results in Spain, U.K. and Mexico. Year-over-year inflation for food and sundries and fresh foods, while still elevated, were at their lowest levels in nearly a year, with food and sundries inflation dropping to the high single digits and fresh foods to the low to mid-single digits. Moving to merchandise highlights. The following comparable sales results by category for the month excludes the negative impact from foreign exchange. Food and sundries were positive low double digits. Cooler, food and sundries were the strongest. Fresh foods were up mid-single digits. Better-performing departments included bakery and meat. Non-foods were negative mid-single digits. Better-performing departments included tires, health and beauty aids and apparel. Majors, which were electronics and big-ticket electronics items, jewelry, housewares, domestics and small appliances and hardware were the worse performers, consistent with Q2 overall. Ancillary businesses sales were up mid-single digits. Food court, hearing aid and pharmacy were the top performers there. Finally, in terms of upcoming earnings and sales releases, we will announce our March sales results for the 5 weeks ending Sunday, April 2, on the following Wednesday, April 5, after market close. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back over to Emma for questions and answers. Thank you. Well, I think as we talked about even the last 12 weeks ago, in the quarterly numbers, we've seen some weakness in what I'll call big-ticket discretionary items. I'm not an economist, but I think it's a combination of the economy and concerns out there as well as particularly strong numbers that we enjoyed not only a year ago but a year prior to that with COVID that we, of course, benefited in big ways with those big-ticket items. So all those things, I think, reflect that in those numbers. There's just a couple of weeks in a couple of regions where we started to set out some seasonal things for spring and summer. So far, so good, but it's literally small data points in small parts of the country where the weather has been a little better, which is not a lot of places. But anecdotally, some comments were made on things like even some water sports items and camping equipment. But it's a small data set. So we'll cross our fingers and hope to see. But overall, units are generally fine. I mean there's some things still with like, on the computer side, there's weakness overall, not just with us. I think I mentioned this on the first quarter call, we're seeing decent sales in units of televisions while the average selling price points have come down. I think it's just in the next couple of weeks where the new TVs for the upcoming season are coming out. But other than that, what we look at, of course, our average transactions or shopping frequency is up. Our new sign-ups are continuing to be strong, up 7% in terms of new sign-ups on less than 3% new openings. So those things bode well, but people certainly are spending their dollars where they feel they should be spending them. And so we'll see where it goes from here. Well, look, we feel good about what we're doing in driving business in the right way and growing our business. As you and others have heard forever, we're a top line company. While I can't give guidance, certainly, we and everybody who has cash benefit from earning more money on their cash right now. As we saw in this quarter, there was a $70 million improvement in year-over-year comparison of gross margin simply because of LIFO. We can't predict what's going to happen, at least the trends yesterday were that we're starting to see some improvement in inflation. To the extent that continues, we're comparing to LIFO charges in excess of $100 million and $200 million in each of Q3 and Q4. So that's something that we look at as well. Gas is volatile, no pun intended, and it's been quite profitable in some quarters more than others. But we think that we've got the different levers and puts and takes, if you will, to do that. But ultimately, it's about driving sales. And certainly, we know we're getting the customer in. We're getting more of them in and they're, again, renewing at the highest rate ever. So we'll go through this as good, if not better, than others. Well, we're going to do things that drive market share, first and foremost. We are certainly cognizant of the bottom line. And I think this quarter is a good example of that. But at the same token, we're going to do what we need to do to drive sales because long term, when we get our customer in and they buy stuff, they're going to come back and buy more stuff. And we've always done a good job of that. Again, this one is a little different, this economic downturn, with the rising interest rates and the headlines of recession and high interest rates. But that being said, I think we're fortunate in the sense that we've got a multitude, various types of businesses within our business from big ticket discretionary items to food and sundries and health and beauty aids and fresh foods, which is really driving the cart right now more so than it has in the past. So we'll continue to do what we do. I remember years ago, someone asked about if sales were slowing down, what would we do. And we said we'd drive more sales by being even hotter on prices. But generally, that's worked for us, and I see that equation continuing. Yes. Actually, June would be our sixth anniversary. As I mentioned in the previous calls, looking at the last, I think, 3, they averaged around 5 years and 7 months, which is about now or last month. And what we said over the last few quarters is that, in our view, it's a question of when, not if. And so we'll let you know. But keep in mind, that's one way that we become even more competitive. We take those monies and directly become even more competitive. I might add though, our locations do weekly comp shops of 100 to 150 key items, all directly competitive items, and then a variety of other against our direct competitors and other limited comp shops against other forms of traditional retail where the gap of competitiveness is much greater. But at the end of the day, our relative level of competitiveness, in our view, is as strong as it's ever been. And we do that weekly in locations. And every 4-week, monthly 2-day budget meeting, each of the regional operations' senior executives get up and show those numbers. And you can rest assure we're going to continue to do that. Not terribly different than a quarter ago or probably in David's January sales recording. So again, it all centers around big-ticket discretionary. And we look at that and we look at how it compared to a year ago and then 2 years ago. We had so much strength there not only with COVID and people buying big-ticket stuff, now the economy and the interest rates, so that's to be expected. Again, we kind of go phew, our strength in food and sundries and fresh foods and health and beauty aids and things like that help to counter some of that. One interesting comment that I think I haven't made in the past, we've been asked that during this concern about inflation and people trading down, have we seen any delta in the sales penetration of our own Kirkland Signature items. And of course, my first comment is that's a trade up or a trade equal, not a trade down. But at the end of the day, we have seen actually, in the last few months, a bigger delta than normal. I'd say over the last 10 years, we see 0.5% or a little less than 0.5% a year of increased penetration. For this quarter year-over-year, we're seen a little over 1.5 percentage point increase in sales penetration on the food side, foods being anything packaged or dry or wet, you name it. And so we have seen a little bit of an increase in that. I guess that's consistent with the concession that most people are looking to save money. And of course, if it's our brand, that's great. That creates loyalty. I was looking at it more not as a source of funds but more as -- look, to the extent that, and this is just using this as an example, if there was no LIFO charge plus or minus in Q3 and Q4, on a year-over-year comparison, you have, on a pretax basis, $130 million positive delta and a $223 million positive delta. Those are nice numbers to have a positive delta. So from a standpoint of looking at the earlier question about are we cognizant of earnings growth, if you will, or reported earnings per share, part of that plays into that, that gives us a little bit of cushion there as does gasoline from time to time, as does, first and foremost, stronger sales. So all those things play into that. I think generally speaking, we're still going to do what's right, in our view, to drive sales. That's what we want to do, first and foremost. And to the extent that, that example occur in Q3 and Q4, that gives us a little room to do that without even thinking about it. If the lapping stays at 0, yes, there would be no new charge, so it would be comparing to a charge last year. To the extent that, yes, prices were to go down relative to a year ago, you'd actually have a LIFO credit, which would be even a bigger year-over-year delta. Yes. Gas has been a relative blessing as well. It's a profitable business. It is volatilely profitable. Sometimes it's more. And sometimes, it's less. But overall, it's a profitable business. It's given us an additional competitive advantage of getting people in the door, if you will. I think it was this last summer into early fall where I've given some numbers where our gallon sales increases in the U.S. were up in the mid- to high teens compared to darn near flat for the U.S. population as a whole. I announced yesterday on that, and I think that 15-plus percent delta of us versus the U.S. population is still about 10 percentage points. And so we are still taking market share, if you will, and getting people in the parking lot. And in terms of value, we look at a value compared to average value across our locations where we do comp shops, in some cases, every day in many locations. This year, to date, I'm looking at single-digit number, we feel that we saved a member $0.37. That's an improvement. Over the last 5 years, it's gone from the mid-20s to the mid-30s. Well, it's an art, not a science. We'll look at high-velocity items where we can make a big difference, pass on some items. On some things, I mean this is just anecdotal because it was from our last budget meeting, with shipping costs coming dramatically down, on a 25- and 50-pound bags of jasmine rice, we've seen a big uptick in sales because that's an item that really skyrocketed because it's per pound, based on the size of the bag, it was a heavy freight cost. And so as that comes down, we see that going. I think we're doing more with our suppliers, changing things around with the MVM. Part of that's based on allocation issues of what we have. But overall, no, we're firm believer of if you improve the value by lowering the price, you're going to drive more sales. Frankly, the delta between those various categories are not as extreme as they used to be. And in fact, in things like fresh foods and food and sundries, some of the weaker categories -- not weaker, but lower-margin categories -- are things like big-ticket discretionary items. We make a smaller percentage, more dollars per unit, of course, but a smaller percentage on big-ticket electronics. And so that impacts more the gross margin dollars than the percentages there. If anything, if you go do a little homework on what the cost of processing and selling a rotisserie chicken, our $4.99 price, which we maintain, is an investment in low prices to drive membership, to drive the sales in a big way. So there are some things that we do, notwithstanding huge inflation. And even though some of the costs have come down a little bit, relatively speaking, we want those wow items in there as well. Well, it helps a little right now. So that's good news. I don't think it changes our view that the special dividend, which we've done over the last 10.5 years, I think, it's still an arrow in our quiver. And at some point, it's something you might see again. But I'm not trying to be cute, it's kind of like the membership question, we'll let you know when we do it. Sure. Well, I think on the latter comment, we're looking to use price to gain share, we're continuing to do that. It's not like we're going to go do more or less. I mean that's what we do for a living. What I was trying to say in the comment, that being we're particularly cognizant to the bottom line, we are a public for-profit company, and our shareholders want to know what we're doing. There have been times, for those of you that have followed us for many years, when we might take a bigger hit on some expense in a given quarter. I think, in fact, many years ago, it was the rotisserie chicken example that we, frankly, I think, have more levers today to adjust things, which helps us. But we're not going to get away from those 2 things, driving the top line and being cognizant that we're also a public company trying to earn money for our shareholders. But we're going to prioritize driving sales because that will benefit all the other things on the income statement. Yes. By the way, gasoline inventory is very small relative to everything else. And it turns darn near daily. But a lot of the improvement or reduction in inventory year-over-year was all the stuff backed up with the supply chain challenges and the port challenges a year ago. So we feel we're in good inventory shape. The flow is much better. There's always going to be anecdotal examples of stuff, we have a little too much of something or a little too less, but we feel pretty good right now about our inventory levels even by category. There's a few categories, a little over a few categories under, but nothing like when we were 26% up and had a lot of, what I'll call, in-transit stuff literally on those pictures that you saw on the news, of the ports, on the ships. And so that's improved a lot. Well, we don't project where we're going. But I was glad at least that February, while negative, was a little better than January. We've got additional marketing activities that we've got going on there. We did hire just 5 months ago a new Head of Digital that is in the process of doing a lot of things. So there'll be more to report over the next several quarters. In my view, there's a lot of opportunities and low hanging fruit to do that. The biggest thing, the challenge that we've had, just looking at our current numbers, was that we've been so successful over the last 2 years. Not only did COVID drive huge business on big-ticket things for home, be it furniture, electronics, televisions, you name it, computers, and also the acquisition a couple of years ago or 3 years ago of what's now called Costco Logistics, those 2 things drove that business in such a big way. We recognize that's part of it. But we're not hanging our hat on that, we want to grow the sales. Well, they're more loyal, they spend more and they come more frequently. It's only good stuff. So look, at the end of the day, if we can get somebody to, in the U.S. as an example, spend $120 instead of $60 at the current rates, and with that, they get the 2% Reward with some other benefits on certain consequential transactions, that definitely drives loyalty and drive frequency. And so the executive member spends more and shops more. And then if we get them also to get the co-branded Citi Visa card, it's even better than that. So all those things work, in our view, in a positive direction. And so we like the fact that the executive membership penetration helped. We've said in the last couple of years, we brought it into a few other smaller countries. You need a core base of 15 or so locations to do it. And so we've provided it in other locations as well. But we're still seeing increased penetration in the U.S. of that. We do a better job, by the way, when somebody new comes in to sign up, getting them to sign up, we do a better job of explaining the benefits of an executive membership than we did years ago as well. Yes. I think the biggest component of the answer to that question is our fresh margins have been the biggest piece of that coming down. And looking at it, our fresh margin in Q2 compared to Q2 3 years ago, pre-COVID, we're still up about 50, 60 basis points. Now we were up a lot more than that because of all the things that COVID did. It drove tremendous sales growth in those areas, which created less spoilage, which is a proponent of cost of sales in fresh foods, and labor productivity in places like the bakery and the meat department. And so it was, if you will, outsized improvement. We're still better than we were pre-COVID. And we've maintained the sales. These are not real numbers, I don't have them in front of me, but let's make them up and say that fresh pre-COVID was going up 8% or 10% a year, 8% a year or whatever it was, and then we enjoyed a couple of years of 20-plus percent, I believe. And now we're still doing fine with sales growth, not up to 8% or 10%, but nonetheless, it's still a positive. And so we've kept all those outsized gains. But we've also, of late, not just the last month or 2 but over the last several months, have invested in pricing. And certainly, fresh helps drive that. And I gave the example of the rotisserie chicken, but that goes through lots of areas of fresh foods where that's one of the key categories that people come in to shop for. I don't think we're smart enough to know how to manage all these things. There's so many different components of what is the gross margin from the different core departments to the ancillary businesses, to gas, to LIFO now. So it really is fluid. And we do manage it, but it's managing it in an organized, chaotic way sometimes, too, as things change every day. I think we do a great job of doing it. Sometimes, in a given month even, it can be bigger or smaller, honestly. I mean gas fluctuates quite a bit. But good try on asking. No. Not at all. Yes, units are still up. And frankly, price inflation offsets it a little bit, it helps offset it a little bit, and I think the focus on trying to keep figuring out how to do things more efficiently. One of the things that, again, that we do religiously every 4 weeks at the budget meeting is the operators are talking about certain focus items, whether it's improving overtime hours or things we've done to automate something, physically improve the flow of goods in a warehouse. We've done a pretty good job of that. And we've done that notwithstanding to off-season wage increases this year, 3 off-season wage increases, if you go back, I think, over the last 15 months. So our leverage there and a very slight deleverage is pretty impressive given that labor benefits is our single biggest expense category. So it's productivity. And I think we've continued to do a good job with that. It's mix. Yes, it's mix. Well, I think there are, and we do. We don't analyze, frankly, the price elasticity on a historical basis other than we know what works in the past and we keep doing it more. It's pretty straightforward. But we're not doing A/B tests or test let's take this price delta in this region, down x or up only y; in a different region, see which one works better. We're pretty singularly focused on if we lower the price, we'll do more sales. Well, first and foremost, is being in stock, and to the extent that we bring in a few things early. I think the anecdotal comment I mentioned about water sports and camping, we brought that a little earlier because we had some room. And there's parts of the country, there's no sense bringing in some of that stuff early given the weather right now. But at the end of the day, I think we've always done a pretty good job of that as well. The big thing is working with the suppliers. Using electronics as an example, these are anecdotal stories, but while sales were very strong for 2 years during COVID and supply chain challenges were still there, there was virtually no promotional things. There's now more promotional. Our buyers are out there making sure that we're getting every promotional penny that's out there and being on top of that with our suppliers. That's part of what we do. But that's been more of a focus. Yes, we focus on the categories that are growing. Examples would be like HABA and apparel, which are very strong for us right now. Part of apparel's strength is getting more well-known stuff in. Well, I think I said that they're as wide as they've ever been. I don't know if they've gotten wider. But we feel very good about where they are. And this is against direct competitors or other large boxes on certain categories, recognizing when it's a traditional retailer, there's a much bigger price gap to start with. And I'll remind you also, despite the fact that we and another warehouse club essentially sell the same types of items, we want to make sure that on exact like-branded items, we're better priced. So on those $100 million, $150 million, that's where we look at that. They're the most competitive, whether it's Coke and Pepsi or Advil or Tide detergent or key items that everybody knows the price of or is that same item. There are plenty of items that are differing in quantity, quality, size, color, you name it, where we feel that, in some cases, we have a better value. But that's up to the customer to behold that. And so we just keep doing what we're doing. We're focusing on those competitive items and constantly figuring out how to drive more value in any item we do. How do we, especially private label, but how do we upsize the pack while improving the price per unit within the pack? Even when there was big inflation, if there was a 10% increase, inflationary cost increase in something, how do we get the vendor to eat a little of it, will eat a little of it? Needless to say that still the majority of that increase is going to be in the price, but how do we also, beyond that, from a manufacturing standpoint and a packaging standpoint, how do we lower the price by a few extra percentage points by figuring out how to get x percent more cell units on a pallet by changing the configuration of the pack size. We focus more on that than anybody I know because we're taking our $230 billion or $240 billion in sales and dividing it by 3,800 items. So we have many items that are $50 million, $100 million, $300 million, $500 million items. And when we can do that, we think that we do a good job of that. I'm sorry, what was that? Well, I think it's our model versus other models. We respect and have very formidable competitors, whether it's other warehouse clubs or big box discounters or supermarkets. And we're all doing what we can do to maximize our own respective model. So I think certainly, when we make some price changes to things, we see our competitors act to them in some cases and not in others. I think the fact that we have fewer items and we're out there every week, I know that our merchants, when they see those comp shops, I'm making this up, that there's 100 items, and we're the same on 50 and lower on 45 and higher on 5, those 5 better be changed this week. And so I know we're on top of it. I can't speak to our competitors, but I assume they are also. But we have a model, a cost structure, that allows us to mark up our goods, on average, in the low teens compared to traditional retailers in the mid-20s to 100. So we have a little room there. No, we're going to open where we want to open certainly whether it's an existing open location or something that we're aware of based on what's going on in the real estate activity out there, which we all know what everybody is doing in advance in a way. And so does it impact us? It may impact us in some examples, whether it's Sam's or somebody else, to push this one more soon. And look, I was going to say, when you asked about them announcing they're going to open more doors, I think they said they're going to open up about 30 over the next 5 or so years, 5 or 6 years. They apparently didn't get the memo that they should close some more. I'm just kidding. Look, we respect them as a competitor, and we don't see that changing what we do. I think it bodes well, though, that there's plenty of capacity still in this country, of course, other countries, even more so. Not really. My guy is here looking at the numbers, and they're saying not really. One of the things that Josh mentioned is, well, we have 400 locations. 400-plus of our 550-ish location in the U.S. have gas, that's even a bigger percentage in California, and higher volume gas units. And with gas inflation coming down dramatically year-over-year, that's partly why they're not the best performers. If you took that out, there's not a whole big difference out there. It's a long road ahead. We only have 11 carwashes. So we have plenty of room for carwashes 30 years from now. But at the end of the day, we think it's a very long road. It's not happening in the next few years. And the fact that we're still taking such market share relative to U.S. gas gallons in general is a positive. So I think it's a question that we can defer for 5 or 10 years, frankly. Well, international, in general, there's plenty of opportunities. If you look at some of the foreign countries, as a percent of sales, they are more profitable than the U.S. So those things, that creates more opportunity. I don't see anything big right now coming on vertical integration. Might we do another poultry activity at some point, but that's still a few years down the road to even consider. We did a second meat plant outside of Chicago for the Midwest and East Coast just a couple of years ago. We're expanding our bakery commissary. So there's nothing, another couple of hundred million dollar plus projects going on like that. I think another area that I think bodes well for us in terms of competitiveness and continuing to work on getting prices down is working with suppliers, certain things that we currently ship from the U.S., elsewhere, or air freight in the case of produce elsewhere, there's plenty of activity going on what I'll call the hot house side, could you grow more vegetables. But that's all good in concept, but it takes time to figure out. And there's plenty of people trying to figure it out, and so we're waiting for that. The other thing I think I gave an example a few years ago, of something as simple as cashews. Historically, they're all grown and washed and prepped for roasting in Eastern Africa, shipped to America for roasting, quality roasting, packaging and then shipped out to the 13 or 14 countries. Today, those that are ultimately sold in Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Australia and China, are now shipped to Vietnam to a quality roaster supplier of ours. They grew over time with us. And we dramatically lowered the cost on that portion of a huge amount of dollars, and then using that to do what we normally do, take 80% or 90% of that savings and lower the price even further in those countries. There's plenty of opportunities. Now we're now talking with big suppliers of these hundred- and multi-hundred-million dollar items that we buy, whether it's paper goods, plastic items, things like that, which of these items could be produced overseas, particularly on the Asia side, rather than having to produce them here and ship them there. There's a lower cost of production and as long as we can maintain that quality. And so I think there's going to be lots of little opportunities that become, in total, a good opportunity for us. Well, thank you, everyone. We're around. I'm sure we'll be talking to a few of you today and tomorrow and early next week. Have a good afternoon or evening."

In today's press release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal '23, the 12 weeks ended this past November 20. Reported net income for the quarter was $1.364 billion or $3.07 per diluted share. That compared to $1.324 billion or $2.98 a share last year. This year's results included a charge of $93 million pre-tax or $0.15 per share, primarily related to downsizing our charter shipping activities and a tax benefit of $53 million or $0.12 per diluted share related to stock-based compensation. Last year's results included an asset write-off of $118 million pre-tax or $0.20 per diluted share and a tax benefit of $91 million or $0.21 a share related to stock-based compensation. Additionally, the strength of the U.S. dollar resulted in our foreign company earnings translating into fewer U.S. dollars. With 25% to 30% of our earnings generally -- generated outside of the United States, this negatively impacted earnings by about $0.12 per share. In terms of sales, net sales for the first quarter increased 8.1% or $53.44 billion versus $49.42 billion reported last year. On a comparable sales basis during the first quarter, reported U.S. sales increased over the 12 weeks 9.3%; and excluding gas inflation and FX, 6.5%; Canada, 2.4%; reported 8.3% increase, ex gas inflation and FX. Other International reported minus 3.1%; excluding gas inflation, FX, plus 9.1%. So you have all told, 6.6% reported for the company, and ex gas inflation and FX of 7.1%. E-commerce, by the way, was reported of minus 3.7% and a minus 2%, excluding FX. In terms of first quarter comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 3.9% worldwide and up 2.2% in the U.S. Our average transaction size was up 2.6% worldwide and 6.9% U.S. during the first quarter. And foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by a little over 3%, while gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 2.5%. Moving down the income statement. Membership fee income reported in the quarter, our membership fee income came in right at $1 billion. That's $54 million or 5.7% higher than last year's reported number of $946 million. Again, the relative weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, excluding the impact of FX, we're assuming flat FX year-over-year, that $54 million number would have been increased by $32 million, and the membership on an adjusted basis would have been a little over 9% year-over-year on flat FX. In terms of renewal rates, at first quarter-end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rates were 92.5% compared to 92.4% a quarter ago. And worldwide rate came in both at this quarter-end and the previous quarter-end, the same level at 90.4%. We ended first quarter with 66.9 million paying household members and 120.9 million cardholders, both up 7% versus last year, and recognize we added about 22 units over the course of that last year. So that was about just under 3% of that increase. At Q1 end, paid executive memberships were right at 30 million, an increase of 904,000 during the 12 weeks or 75,000 a week during the first quarter. Executive members now represent 45% of our paid membership and just under 73% of worldwide sales. Moving down the income statement to gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the first quarter was lower year-over-year by 45 basis points and lower by 21 basis points, excluding gas inflation. And as I'll explain in a minute, the 93% pre-tax charge, excluding that 93% -- $93 million charge we took in the quarter, gross margin ex gas inflation would have been only down 3 basis points. As I always ask you, jot down the following numbers, two columns and six line items. The first column is reported during the first quarter, a year-over-year delta change in basis points, and the second column, excluding gas inflation. On a core merchandise basis, we reported in the first quarter, minus 52 basis points; and ex gas inflation, minus 31 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses, plus 23% on a reported basis and plus 30%; 2% reward, minus 2 and minus 5; LIFO plus 3 and plus 3; Other, that's the $93 million charge, minus 17 and minus 18. So all told, again, a reported basis was 45, ex gas inflation, 21. So starting with the core. Core merchandise\u2019s contribution to gross margin on a reported basis was lower by 52 basis points year-over-year and lower by 31 basis points ex gas inflation. In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in the first quarter, our core or core gross margin, if you will, was also lower by 31 basis points, with food and sundries being up a little bit, offset by non-foods and fresh foods being down. Fresh foods was down, as you know, for the last couple of years, it's been particularly strong, and it's come down a little bit. In addition, we are looking to hold prices on some of those price points despite inflated costs in some of the fresh food categories. Ancillary and other business gross margins were higher by 23 and higher by 30 basis points ex gas inflation in the quarter, with gas, business centers and travel up year-over-year, offset in part by e-comm, food courts and optical. Our 2% reward, minus 2 basis points; reported, minus 5%, excluding gas inflation, implying higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. LIFO, plus 3 basis points. We had a very small LIFO charge this year, but lapped a $14 million charge in Q1 last year. You recall last year, during the four quarters, we had LIFO charges in excess of $400 million pre-tax with a small amount that $14 million in the first quarter over $100 million in Q3 and over $200 million in Q4. So we'll see what inflation does this year. Hopefully, it will continue to -- its current trends in the right direction. Other, the minus 17 and 18 basis points reported in ex gas inflation. This is the $93 million charge, as mentioned in the earnings release, mostly related to downsizing our charter shipping activities. Over a year after COVID began, you will recall that the supply chain challenges related to shortages of the containers and shipping delays greatly intensified with container, freight and shipping rate skyrocketing. It was in Q4 of 2021 on our earnings call that we mentioned our initial leasing of 3 ships and several thousand containers to help mitigate these challenges. Later, we added 4 additional vessels and additional needed containers with commitments made for up to three years. Our objectives at the time were twofold: first, to increase the ability for more timely shipping and arrival of overseas merchandise. This allowed us to better stay in stock and drive sales; and second, to reduce some of the skyrocketing shipping and associated container costs. We achieved those objectives for a period of time. Over the course of a year, 1.5 years, we controlled the shipping and delivery of nearly 50,000 containers, many that would have been greatly delayed and at an estimated savings as compared to the then current shipping container costs of somewhere between $1,000 and $2,000 per container. That, of course, fluctuated. Now with a dramatic improvement in shipping times and much lower shipping and container costs, it made sense to downsize our commitment and lower prices for our members Moving on to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the first quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 35 basis points, coming in at a 920 compared to a year ago 955. And that plus 35 basis point improvement would be plus 13 basis point improvement, excluding gas inflation. Again, writing down six line items and two columns. First column being reported, second ex gas inflation. During the first quarter, our core operations was lower or better by 8 basis points, plus 8 then; without gas inflation, minus 9; central zero and minus 3; stock compensation, plus 3 and plus 1; preopening zero and zero; Other, plus 24 and plus 24; for a total first column reported year-over-year reported SG&A plus 35 or lower by 35 basis points and ex gas inflation lower by 13. Now going through those numbers, the core operations component of SG&A was again lower by 8 basis points reported, but higher by 9, excluding impact of gas inflation. These results include three sets of wage increases that were done in the past year plus as well as a little lower sales results in Q1 as compared to the prior quarter. Still increases, but a little lower than the prior quarter. Central was flat or zero and higher by 3, ex gas inflation. Stock comp, again, a little lower number in stock comp as a percent, so it came down, improved a little bit. Preopening, no impact. And the other, the 24 basis points you recall last year in Q1, this consisted of an asset write-off totaling $118 million pre-tax, which impacted the SG&A line last year. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $34 million this year, down $5 million or down from $39 million last year. And interest income and other for the quarter was higher by 11 year-over-year, $53 million versus $42 million a year ago. Interest income was higher year-over-year, offset by unfavorable FX. Overall, reported pre-tax income in the quarter was up 4%, coming in at $1.77 billion, compared to $1.696 billion a year ago. And excluding the charges described earlier in both years, pre-tax income was up around 3%. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q1 was 23.0% compared to 20.7% Q1 last year, so a little higher this year. Both years' tax rates benefited from the tax treatment of stock-based compensation, as mentioned earlier. The fiscal '23 effective tax rate, excluding these discrete items -- this discrete item, is currently projected to be between 26% and 27%. A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, we plan to open a net of 24 units this year, 27 openings, including 3 relocations, so net of 24. In the first quarter, the net of that 24 included 7. We planned 3 more in Q2, 4 in Q3 and 10 in Q4. In the first quarter, we opened, as I mentioned, 7 net new warehouses, 4 were in the U.S. and one each was in Korea, our first in New Zealand and our first in Sweden. Additionally, last week, we opened another building in the U.S. And just yesterday, we opened our 14th location in Australia, our second on the country's West Coast in or near Perth. In fiscal '23, again, 27 total new openings, including 3 locations for a net of 24. Of the net 24, it's made up of 15 in the U.S. and 9 in Other International, including our third and fourth locations in China. Regarding CapEx. In the first quarter, CapEx was approximately $1.06 billion. And our estimate for the entire fiscal year is CapEx of somewhere in the $3.8 billion to $4.0 billion range. Moving to e-commerce. E-commerce, as we mentioned in the press release, on a reported basis was -- for the quarter, year-over-year sales were minus 3.7 and minus 2 ex FX. Including sales -- what we don't include in this number is our sales through like same-day delivery for fresh foods with our partners like Instacart, which we don't include those, and they are fulfilled in our warehouse. Our e-comm comps, ex FX, would have been if we included it in the positive low single digits. Stronger departments in terms of year-over-year percentage increases were tickets and gift cards, tires, candy and health and beauty aids. The largest e-comm merchandise department majors, which includes consumer electronics and appliances, which represents over 40 -- close to 40% to 50% of our -- over 40% of our e-com volume was down in the high single digits. Subsequent to quarter end, we did have our two biggest e-comm selling days in our company history, both on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Now a few comments regarding inflation. Recall, we've seen some minor improvements in a few areas. Hopefully, continuing the comment I made last quarter's earnings call, a little light at the end of the tunnel, but it's still little. Recall last quarter in fourth quarter, we estimated that year-over-year price inflation was about 8%. In the first quarter, we estimate the equivalent year-over-year inflation number in the range of 6% to 7%. Food and sundries is still up more than non-foods, but overall, a little better level than a quarter ago for the company. And commodity costs are mostly coming down, whether it's corn flour, sugar and butter or even some things like steel. A few things are up, but overall, we're seeing a little bit of a trend, but we'll keep you posted. Switching over to inventory levels. Recall that our total inventory in both -- at the end of Q3 and at the end of Q4 on a year-over-year basis were up 26% year-over-year. I'm happy to report that good progress was made during the first quarter of this fiscal year. Our increase as of Q1 end dropped to a 10% year-over-year increase, largely driven by an estimated 6% to 7% inflation and about just under 2% year-over-year unit growth. So inventories, while we still have some pockets of a little over inventory, overall, we feel pretty good about it. As a reminder, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our December sales results for the 5 weeks ending Sunday, January 1 on Thursday, January 5, after the market closes. With that, I will open it up to Q&A and turn it back over to Bo. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question this afternoon from Simeon Gutman at Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman : Richard, I want to start with the short-term question. November, the slowdown in the stacks. Is there anything tip of the iceberg there, macro merchandising? Is there something obvious? I mean you were living in pretty rarefied air, but curious if there's anything notable.\nRichard Galanti : No, I think the biggest thing, as I've said a couple of times in a quiet way, it rains on all of us during these tougher times, particularly with bigger ticket discretionary items. We're comparing against some huge increases a year ago, frankly, over the last two or three years, as you know. And that's where we've seen some of the slowdown. As I mentioned, e-comm consumer electronics and appliances, as I mentioned, was down high singles. I think in line was also down some amount. So that's where a big chunk of it is. When we look at food and sundries, that actually tends to be relatively strong for us. So overall, I think it's impacting us a little bit with what's going on out there. I think it is a combination of compared to very strong stuff a year ago as well as the fact that big ticket discretionary has a little bit of weakness.\nSimeon Gutman : Okay. And maybe just a two-part follow-up. One is just related to that answer. Does those two couple of days, I don't know if you can judge enough from it, does it bring you back to some type of trend line? Or it sounds like your tone is there's still some pressure? And then the real follow-up is on gas gross profits. If you just think about the movement of the lap throughout this fiscal year, does it progressively get harder through the year in terms of the lap? And then can you highlight to us which quarter has the highest cents per gallon lap throughout the rest of the year?\nRichard Galanti : Yes. I have a couple of people in the room smiling. Of course, I can't tell you all that. But at the end of the day, first of all, if you look at our November reported numbers, the fact that those two dates -- those two high dates on e-com were in the last week. Keep in mind, e-comm is still a little under 10% of our total company, but that helped a little bit relative to e-comm in the last 4 weeks that we reported. But overall, look, we don't know what kind of trend it means. We feel pretty good about what we're doing in terms of driving sales. And as I mentioned, the food and sundries as we get past big-ticket discretionary purchases for the holidays, for Christmas and what have you, you'll have a higher penetration of some other things as well. As it relates to gas, for several quarters now, even beyond a year ago, we talked about the gas profitability for us and we believe our competitors -- other big chains of gas stations have made more in gas. And certainly, that's helped us use some of that to continue to hold prices where we can on some things. Who knows what the new normal is? What we know is that not only is gas more profitable than it has been in the past, and like I said the same thing a year ago, will that change at some point? Maybe. We don't know. So right now, it's good. And by the way, as we've mentioned a couple of times, we've seen strong gallon sales, and we're still taking market share. We -- when the U.S. gallon sales are generally close to flat, we're up in the 10% to 15% range in gallons. So we're driving people into the parking lot. And the fact that gallons of gas are profitable, that there's just a little bit more for us as well. So that's helped us. There's always things that are going to help us, and there's always going to be puts and takes.\nOperator: Thank you. We go next now to Chuck Grom at Gordon Haskett.\nChuck Grom : My question is on the LIFO charge. It looks like if it's a few basis points of a hit, that would back into about $30 million to $40 million. And I'm curious, I know you don't provide guidance, but knowing what you know now and if inflation holds at that, say, 6% level, would that be a good proxy for the charge, at least over the next couple of quarters?\nRichard Galanti : Well, I think, yes, LIFO was a slight pickup just because the dollar amount was less than the $14 million last year in the quarter. It's very slight. So if that continues, that would be good, and that would bode well. And you'd have -- I'm guessing you'd have a lot lower charge than $423 million, recognizing the big pickup was in Q3. The big hit was in Q3 and 4 when we saw the beginning of inflation rising. If inflation didn't go down, but it just stayed the same, in theory, you'd have no big charge. You have no additional charge. If it starts to go down from its peaks, that will have -- there'll be some LIFO income. Now mind you, some of that will be used for pricing as well. I mean, well, you know us.\nChuck Grom : Yes. Okay. So what would you do to have the absolute dollar amount for the LIFO charge in the quarter for us?\nRichard Galanti : Yes. It was less than $1 million.\nChuck Grom : Less than $1 million. Okay, great. And then on the ancillary line, you've had real good success there in back-to-back quarters and you outlined gas profitability, e-comm, food court. Is there one that's been more outsized over the past couple of quarters and that maybe we could think about over the next few quarters because it's been a nice improvement?\nRichard Galanti : Well, look, gas is just the sheer size of our gasoline business. It's been the biggest piece of that line for a few years. We have a -- it's a $30-plus billion -- on our $220-whatever-billion last year, we did in sales, I think a little over $30 billion was gas. So that's the big kahuna among all that stuff.\nOperator: We go next now to Michael Lasser of UBS.\nMichael Lasser : Richard, between the 31 basis point core-on-core gross margin discussion -- decrease for core on core gross margin, the discussion around giving up some shipping capacity to have a better price for your member, is the mindset of Costco right now as the economy enters a more difficult economic period, Costco is going to be stepping up price investments in order to gain market share?\nRichard Galanti : I think we continue just to remain competitive. You've known us long enough when asked who is our toughest competitor, we look in the mirror, and we say it's us. So I think that as we drive market share, part -- we believe that part of it at least is due to the fact that we've continued to be very competitive. And so I don't know if there's any change in that. We -- notwithstanding where our numbers come out, we're always trying to push more into lowering the prices or keeping the price increases going not as high as they could have been. I think fresh foods is a good example of that of late, where, again, we've held the price points on certain items despite inflated costs, mostly in the protein area and a little bit in the bakery area.\nMichael Lasser : And Richard, you've long talked about, the Costco model is driven, first and foremost, by sales, and the need to drive at least the mid-single-digit comp in order for the other parts of the P&L to work. So is the economy is entering a softer period where discretionary sales can be a little weaker and Costco's overall sales are going to be a little softer, should we be modelling and prognosticating just a lower overall earnings growth for Costco during this time as when we go to these factors?\nRichard Galanti : Well, good news is that's your job to model it. Look, at the end of the day, I think that the comment I made about big-ticket discretionary, while we sell big-ticket discretionary includes furniture, which we sell lawn and garden, patio, too, that's not right now at the holiday season necessarily. But that being said, there is a higher proportion of big ticket discretionary right now. And we're blessed in the sense that a big chunk of our business is fresh foods and food and sundries, which people have to eat. And as I mentioned, that has been strong throughout this. So I think overall, we'll probably still look at it in a positively relatively aggressive standpoint. Ultimately, when you talk about top line sales and if they're a little lower, what do we need? I think the question historically has always been asked, what do we need to have SG&A not go up as a percent of sales? And the view is -- and this is pre-inflation. The view is always you need something -- our best guess view is somewhere in the 4% to 5% comp range. If it falls below that, that will make SG&A a little bit of a challenge. That being said, we're pretty pragmatic, and we know how to use our margin as well. So I think overall, we'll continue to work entirely to drive top line sales and look at it for the long term. And we're not in any big way cutting back orders at this juncture, where we see some challenges with big-ticket discretionary? Does it come down a little? I think the keyword there is a little. And we\u2019re feeling very good about some of our business now despite what's going on out there. We're blessed that we think, again, I think as evidenced by gas and any food and sundries business, we're blessed by taking market share still. I think that's evidenced in our memberships and...\nMichael Lasser : Your answer was a lot better than my questions.\nOperator: We go next now to Rupesh Parikh at Oppenheimer.\nRupesh Parikh : So just on the core-on-core decline of 31 basis points. I was hoping you provide more color just in terms of what's driving that decline in non-foods category? And then just related to the pressure on fresh foods. I know I think you've now lapped some of the last year, I think, fresh foods is also a headwind. So when do we lap some of the -- I guess, some of the efficiencies that you gained during the pandemic? Because I know you've given it back in recent quarters. So I'm trying to get a sense of when that pressure point could go away.\nRichard Galanti : I don't know exactly. I mean if we're three quarters of a year into it. I think if I recall, over the last two or three quarters, we've talked about like fresh being that way and probably exacerbated a little right now with the fact that we're trying to hold prices on some things that we think that, that's driving our sales. Beyond that -- I forgot the first part of the question now.\nRupesh Parikh : Just on non-foods, any more color on...\nRichard Galanti : Oh, yes. I think that -- yes, fundamentally -- first of all, in terms of overall, it's fundamentally fresh and then some non- foods. Some of that has to do with some of the big ticket things. If you've been online and saw some things we did during not just the week of Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, but we did some -- anywhere from $100 to $500 off on, I think, $500 cash card, if you bought $3,000 or more of these items. And so we're getting rid of some of the reason that 26% year-over-year inventory increase went to 10% was we got rid of some of the stuff that we -- some things that we had deep freeze and some things that we had delayed shipping during the supply chain challenge. So we did take some more markdowns than normal as you would expect, to help get rid of that. And hopefully, that's not a pressure point going forward. Certainly, I don't think it will be as much. And again, there are so many moving parts to this equation. I wish it was as easy as each basis point we could explain. We try to give you the rounded numbers. But overall, again, I get back to we feel good about how we're doing competitively. And we certainly understand that big ticket discretionary things have shown a little weakness, in part, because of our strength from a year ago, and in part, it's got to be part of the economy. And the good news is we have a big chunks of our business that are fresh foods, food and sundries, health and beauty aids, gas, all those types of things. And even other things like that's small, but travel has come back really strong from a really weak place a couple of years ago.\nRupesh Parikh : Great. And then maybe just one additional question just on the membership fee hike. If we are in a weaker economic backdrop next year, does that at all impact how you guys are thinking about the timing of the membership fee hike?\nRichard Galanti : Well, it certainly goes into the thought process. We're still not even to the average of the last three increases in terms of timing between the last one and the next one. What we've said again, and I'll say again, is that our view is all the parameters, as it relates to member loyalty and value proposition that we've improved to our member we have no problem thinking about doing it and doing it ultimately. So it's a question of when, not if. But we feel that we're in a very strong competitive position right now. And if we have to wait a few months or several months, that's fine. And I'll be purposely coy on when that might be.\nOperator: We go next now to Paul Lejuez at Citi.\nBrandon Cheatham : It's Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. First one, I wanted to dig into the decision on holding the price on fresh. Are you seeing competitors do the same and that's why you reacted there? Or are you kind of trying to lead the charge there? And just curious like why make that decision since it seems like the consumer has been happy to take increased price, especially in fresh?\nRichard Galanti : The last thing you said there is exactly, I think, why we chose to do a little more there. We want to be the most competitive, and we can drive a lot of volume. And again, we're in it for the long term. And it's -- fresh is one of those unique areas where prices on many items do change almost weekly on some of those items. If not sooner, if not more quickly. And so our buyers are always looking at the, if you will, the supermarket ads as well as the other warehouse club ads, not literally ads, but what the pricing is, and we react to that. But we're also -- part of it is also consciously keeping the price on the chicken at $4.99, and keeping -- and those types of things, keeping the price on the hotdog. All those things go into that equation as well. But we know that, that can be a driver of business. Fresh, we got great stuff, and people do notice the price. In our view, people notice those prices differences.\nBrandon Cheatham : And just a quick follow-up. You have a large competitor that's been talking about increased members in the $100,000-plus income cohort. Obviously, it's not impacting your membership numbers, but I'm just wondering, do you see any impact on share of wallet or any thoughts there? Do you look at how many of your members might have additional memberships as well?\nRichard Galanti : Well, we don't -- what's that? No. Somebody in the room is telling me we were also up in terms of the average household incomes. So I think we're both seeing that. We know a lot of -- particularly of our executive -- our business members, in many cases, probably have both cards. They've always had both cards. And so no, we don't put our head in the sand as it relates to it, but we look at our numbers and how we're doing, and we've seen that the -- our penetration of higher income members has also benefited during this time.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Oliver Chen at Cowen.\nRichard Galanti : Before Oliver answers -- Oliver, before you ask a question, one other comment. One of the things that we have not done and don't plan to do is do a lot of promotional activities with our membership. And so that -- certainly, that will, in the short term, help drive membership, but we don't do a lot of that. Go ahead, Oliver.\nOliver Chen : Regarding e-commerce and going forward, what are your thoughts? You're up against some tough compares, but as we model it on a longer-term basis, how should the growth rates evolve? And then as we think about non-food, you talked about it a lot, but do you expect the non-food percentage mix to change from the past? Or it will more normalize? And lastly, on the higher income consumer and gains there, would love for you to elaborate on what's happening? And if you're getting more luxury consumers in terms of higher income folks joining in the club?\nRichard Galanti : Sure. I wrote down non-food -- in terms of what's the new normal? Look, we don't know what the new normal is. I do know that we figure out how to drive total sales. I do know that over the last 2.5 years through COVID, people buying things for their home, whether it was indoor furniture, outdoor furniture, exercise equipment, electronics and appliances and it's even greater because of our acquisition in April of 2020 of the last mile, big and bulky delivery and installation arm from Sears, all that stuff has helped us dramatically. Look, a little bit is -- again, we don't know how much of it is just comparing against very strong numbers versus a little weakness. Our guess is a little above. We want to drive -- we always want to drive everything, but we want to drive more non-food things because you've got -- you don't need any extra space. If you're turning fresh foods at 50, 60 times a year or more, you're turning some non-food categories at 8 times a year. It's easy to go from 8 to 10 without any extra space in the building. So that's always been a goal of ours to drive both sides of the business, and we think we're pretty good at doing it. And this will be -- we'll find out what the answer is a year from now. On -- what was the other question? I'm sorry.\nOliver Chen : On e-comm and the e-com long-term growth rate there. And then also the higher income membership.\nRichard Galanti : Sure. Okay. On e-comm, again, that is even more dramatic if you look at what e-com did. We essentially doubled e-comm over a 12-month period from about worldwide from about 8 billion to 16 billion in that probably three or four months into COVID and then going fast forward a year. So the last half of fiscal '20 and the first half of fiscal '21, we had pretty good numbers over the last year. That, of course, dramatically impacted in a good way from our acquisition of Innovel. And doing, as I mentioned on the last earnings call, pre that acquisition in the U.S., we did about a little over 2 million drops, and a drop is anything from dropping off a sofa to dropping off and installing a washer dryer or a refrigerator freezer and taking the old one away.  We've gone from a little over 2 million drops. In fiscal '22, we did a little over 4 million drops, 70% of which is on the site and this operation that we acquired. So we've had outsized growth on that. Helped also not only by the acquisition but COVID itself. So we're comparing against that now. We'll see where that goes. We think that e-commerce still long term. First of all, as you know, we still want you to get into the warehouse as well. That's what -- so long term, we still think right now, we want to grow the e-commerce. I would say our goal still is to grow it a little more than in line right now because so much of it has been benefited by big ticket items, which have shown some weakness that's impacting a little bit right now. So -- but long term, we want to still be even 9% or 10% of $240 billion or $250 billion business here is a big chunk of business.  In terms of the last question, I'm sorry, I didn't write it down.\nOliver Chen : Yes. I think of Costco is a luxury company, too. So what are your thoughts on getting the higher income consumers? And anything you're seeing with your existing consumers in terms of behavior because everybody is under a little bit of pressure as well?\nRichard Galanti : Well, again, someone in the room here showed me that I think the data that somebody had asked me about where Walmart had indicated, we're all looking at that same data. We too saw the metrics of a little bit higher percentage of higher income people coming in, notwithstanding the fact that we start with a higher percentage to start with. That's -- we try to trade you up. And you know the quality of our merchandise, and we'd much rather sell you a bigger ticket item with all the bells and whistles. So I think that -- it's the way we merchandise, and we're not looking to change that at this juncture.\nOperator: We go next now to Greg Melich of Evercore.\nGreg Melich : Richard, I'd just like to talk about how -- traffic seems to be growing closer to 2% now in the U.S. Is there anything specific going on there? Or we just need to get used to it as recycling lower gas prices and tough out the slower traffic?\nRichard Galanti : Perhaps. I mean we still think anything that's even in the low single digits is great. And we benefited clearly from -- over the course of the last year, we benefited, as I've seen in our membership sign-ups, more people coming in and the gas business driving that a little bit as well. And just during COVID, we had a higher than previously average tick up and new member sign-ups. And so that's probably subsiding a little bit at this juncture. But again, we feel good -- very good about where our renewal rates are and then the loyalty that our members have. And we're pretty good at keep trying to figure out ways to get them in. We're doing -- we do online e-mails that are in-line directed for hot items to come in only available in store. And so those are the things that we continue to do.\nGreg Melich : Got it. Could you update us on any private label extra gains that you're getting in this environment or trade down perhaps between proteins or anything like that worth calling out?\nRichard Galanti : We haven't seen -- last quarter, I mentioned a couple of things on the fresh side and the protein side that we actually saw strength in canned chicken and tuna, which was the comment that the buyers made saying that we're seeing -- to the extent that prices were skyrocketing and some fresh protein, we saw strength in canned protein. We don't see currently a lot of trade down on fresh. Prices have started to come down on some of those items as the underlying commodity costs have come down a little bit. KS penetration is up. Our critical senior is up. I don't have the exact number in front of me. I'm guessing it's about somewhere approaching 1 percentage point, but -- which is big when it's, I would say, over the last several years, it's probably been 0.5 percentage point. But -- so probably up a little more than normal, but -- and again, we had -- somebody asked us the question recently, are you seeing some trade down to private label? And we, of course, corrected them and said it's a trade up.\nGreg Melich : You also mentioned it's a housekeeping item, but I want to make sure I got the charge right. So you're basically running a check to reduce the size of a contract that was at a higher price. So when -- what's the payback period on that check? Do we see it over four quarters, two quarters, six quarters?\nRichard Galanti : Yes. It's a moving target, honestly. It's based on rates, frankly, and rates right now have come down dramatically. So that would be a year, it could be a little longer than a year or a little less than a year, depending on what happens tomorrow.\nOperator: We go next now to Peter Benedict of Baird.\nPeter Benedict : Hey, Richard. Just on new member sign-ups, you kind of mentioned it a little bit there in response to Greg's question. But just maybe talk about new member sign-up trends. Holistically, what you're seeing, anything U.S. versus maybe some of these international markets you've been entering. Just interested in your latest thoughts there.\nRichard Galanti : Well, I think the biggest thing continues to be we're better when study does sign up that they sign up in those countries where we offer executive membership, which is, I'm guessing, 85% of our company, more, maybe 90% of our company. It's just not in some of the smaller unit countries. And overall -- starting with the U.S., but overall in Canada, we do a better job of getting you to sign up as an executive member to start with. We also do a better job of getting you to sign up to auto renew with putting in your credit card. All those things help -- let's face it, all those things help, too. We know that an executive member buys more and shops more frequently in a year than a non-store member. We know that one of those members with a credit card, co-brand credit card shops even more frequently and spends more. And they do all 3, they're an executive member with a card versus being a regular member, that's the big kahuna here. And so I think that we've seen those trends go on over the last few years, frankly. And what's helped in the last year is the fact that, again, just our new member sign-ups has been higher than they had been historically over the last few years versus the last year -- last year or two. And I think we believe that's more because of COVID, and we were in a good place to shop.\nPeter Benedict : Sure. That makes sense. And as my last question, just an interest and -- interest income and other, obviously, has a few components to it. I'm curious if you can help us understand what the interest income was in the quarter. I think it was about $8 million last year. I'm sure that was up a lot this quarter. Just curious if you could give us a sense of what that number was in the first quarter?\nRichard Galanti : Is that in the Q? Okay. Yes, I can give it to you. Hold on a second. I didn't realize it's in the Q, which is not out yet. But what it is, is you've got a big increase in interest income and a big increase in FX downside. So of the 50 -- I think it was 53 is -- $54 million is interest income and the negative $1 million is other, which is a chunk of that's FX. And then this year, the $42 million -- I'm sorry, last year, it was $8 million of interest income and $34 million of other, the biggest piece of other being FX. So that added up to the $42 million. This year, the $53 million is $54 million of interest income and minus 1 of other.\nOperator: And we'll go next now to Kelly Bania of BMO.\nKelly Bania : Richard, I just had one on elasticity and then another follow-up on the big ticket. But in terms of elasticity, any changes -- I'm not sure how you measure it or monitor it, but any changes in your members' response to your actions when you are taking some lower prices here?\nRichard Galanti : I think if you asked the buyers overall that there's a little less elasticity than there used to be on some of the things. Again, now that answer comes from the fact that my comments about big-ticket discretionary items. We've put more money behind it and that successfully cleaned up our inventory where we were over in some areas like furniture to some extent. But at the end of the day, I think in a year or two ago, we would have even guessed that could have been a little stronger. But then that gets back to the whole question is the economy -- the concerns in the economy impacting big-ticket discretionary items. So yes, I mean, there's clearly still elasticity. When we do temporary price discounts or even our MVM mailers, we still get good impact from it. Some things, the bigger the ticket, not as much as we used to get.\nKelly Bania : That's helpful. And then just a follow-up again on the big ticket. What percent of your sales would you say are big ticket, maybe it ebbs and flows with the seasons, but just in general? And do you see that members are pretty broad-based in pulling back meaning across income levels, Executive, Gold Star, et cetera?\nRichard Galanti : Well, online, it's a little over 40. But online is only 9% of our sales. In store, I don't have it in front of me. 10 would be a good guess. And including that 10, furniture as well. So big -- and jewelry, big-ticket discretionary.\nOperator: And we'll go next now to Chris Horvers at JPMorgan.\nChristopher Horvers : So following up a little bit there. On the TV side, is it -- how much of it is a units down issue versus deflation? And is there any differentiation that you're seeing between larger and smaller screen size purchases?\nRichard Galanti : Yes. Units are actually up. And there's normal deflation in TV electronics anyway. And -- but there is perhaps a little bit of smaller sizes are coming down a little bit. Not everyone wants an 85-inch television but -- which is where we over-index to bigger ticket stuff to start with. But we are seeing actual unit sales up.\nChristopher Horvers : So units are up with strength -- relative strength in smaller sizes?\nRichard Galanti : Yes. Yes.\nChristopher Horvers : Got it. And then a couple of sort of other bigger picture consumer questions. I guess, is there -- are you seeing maybe some mid- to low end, maybe not buying the 18 pack of Bounty? Like do you think you might be losing some category share as someone's trying to economize the ticket for your -- the lower half of your income perspective? And then can you also -- can you also talk about regionality? Obviously, there's some weakness in certain housing markets in certain cities, and then there's -- you have a big exposure to California. There's been more layoff news in the technology industry, and there's some population migration. So what are you seeing from a regionality perspective where you're seeing more weakness versus strength?\nRichard Galanti : Well, first of all, we're seeing strength in sundries as part of what we call food and sundries, which is everything. Food and food and sundries is everything from canned beverages to crackers and cereal, and sundries, of course, paper goods and cleaning supplies and the like. And we're seeing strength in those areas. Those are -- those are actually strong, offset by some of the weakness I talked about on the non-food side. As it relates to regional, I don't -- we don't really see any big differences. I mean every month, you're going to see a region stronger or weaker. It has more to do in our view right now of late with weather than anything else. I can't give you anything definitive on what's -- is the region -- it's pretty -- they're all pretty close.\nBob Nelson : Within 1.5 points or 2 points.\nRichard Galanti : Bob is saying here, they're within a couple of points of comp.\nChristopher Horvers : Got it. And then one cleanup question. Just on the inventory, you talked about pockets. It sounded like you cleaned up furniture and electronics, it sounds like. Is there any -- where are those pockets? How much is maybe holiday, decor or toys, other more at-risk categories in the month of December?\nRichard Galanti : The good news is our merchants are sitting here, holiday decor is fine. One example actually would be we have a small amount of air conditioners and fans, which was -- it was a hot summer, and we were very strong in it. There were delays some of the supply chain challenges, some of that stuff didn't come in until September. And needless to say, we're not going to put it out there and mark it down when nobody really is looking for an air conditioner unit in September. And so that's the example of a few things now. We still have some furniture. It's way down from where it had been. So very, very manageable. I think beyond that, there's nothing huge. And again, the big question right now would be the fact that from a standpoint of Christmas stuff, both the Christmas stuff as well as toys, we're in pretty good shape for that. We feel pretty good about that.\nOperator: We go next now to Scot Ciccarelli at Truist.\nScot Ciccarelli : I guess I have another gross margin question. And I guess it's -- look, if consumables continue to outpace discretionary goods based on what we're seeing in the economy, should we expect gross margins to compress a bit just from mix? Or do you have enough levers given existing price gaps across most of your categories to match the flattish gross margins? Just how should we think about the mix impact?\nRichard Galanti : We'll let you know next quarter. I mean we have a lot of levers, as you've mentioned, as you suggested, to pull and push. We're also aggressive on pricing when we want to be like in the fresh foods area that I just mentioned. And we're blessed right now with -- in some categories like gas that is a better margin. So all that stuff, again, there's a variety of puts and takes. We feel overall, there's nothing unusual about this quarter. And frankly, if inflation is not rising again, even if it doesn't go down, but it doesn't rise again from its current levels, we're in pretty good stead of greatly improving the component of margin that relates to a LIFO charge, particularly in Q3 and 4 when we had a $100-plus million number and a $200-plus million number. But that's to be seen, and we need to wait and see.\nScot Ciccarelli : So just as a follow-up on that, Richard, like fair to say that we're going to see lower freight rates starting to flow through the P&L and let's call it, less markdown pressure because the inventories are cleaned up a bit more than the last few quarters?\nRichard Galanti : That should help you a little bit. Sure. But as you might expect and one of the reasons we took this charge is we don't want to have to have the buyers worry about inputting higher costs into their -- if rates have come down and we contracted, we want to take some of that out. But that's still being worked through. That's not -- we have to continue to do that. Beyond that, as rates come down, you'll see our prices on items come down, too. Okay. Why don't we take two more questions?\nOperator: Certainly, Richard. Thank you. We'll go next now to Karen Short at Credit Suisse.\nKaren Short : Hope you all have happy holidays coming forward -- going forward. But I did want to clarify on two things. So in the past, when you have had slightly weakening traffic trends that has generally been a point to consider to actually push through higher membership rate increase. So I'm wondering, I know this is a very unusual time, but has that philosophy changed at all? Because obviously, your comps are changing or in -- or slowing? And then I would ask the same thing as it relates to the special dividend. We all know what your cash is and available cash is on the balance sheet in terms of timing with respect to announcing something like that along the lines of the fact that I think your Board meeting is mid-January?\nRichard Galanti : We have one every quarter. Look, we talked about both of those. In terms of the fee increase, I think over the last many years, we've probably done them at a time when things were particularly strong comp wise. The good news is during all times, renewal rates were strong and have gotten even stronger. We always look at ourselves in the mirror and feel that the value proposition has gotten better. That being said, we have done them -- I remember one time we were asked, it may have been back in '09, '10, during the Great Recession because I guess we did one probably in '11 or '12, which continued the Great Recession. And we'd be asked given the Great Recession, would you hold off on it? And our view was -- and comps were a little weaker back then, too, for at least a couple of quarters. And I think the comment I made was something to the effect, we'd probably do it anyway because we're going to use it to drive greater value in terms of pricing and everything in a big way. And so that really -- I think we've probably done it in times of lower comps or higher comps or good economy or tougher economy.  And I think with the headline in the -- I probably mentioned in the last quarter call or even the quarter before that, with the headline being recession question mark and inflation exclamation point, there's no rush. And first of all, even if we follow the pattern of the last three -- over the last 16 or so years, they averaged 5 years and 7 months. And I know now that 5 years and 7 months from June of '17 is January of '23. I know on the last call, I said, that doesn't mean it's going to be January '23. It will be -- it's a question of when, not if. But at this juncture, we'll just have to wait and see. And I'm not trying to be cute about it, but there's not a whole lot more I can tell you. There's no analytical framework we use other than we feel very good about our member loyalty and our strength. And if we wanted to do it yesterday, we could. If we want to do it six months from now, we can. So we'll wait and see. As it relates to the special dividend, as you know, we've said before, it's certainly an arrow in our quiver that has boded well for us, we believe. We think that's done well. We've done 4 of them. The last one was a couple of years ago, and we certainly do have cash. Mind you, when you look at our cash, about half of it's U.S. and not cash equivalents. And so certainly, we have the ability to do it at some point. I think we wanted to wait and see how things are continuing here. I think that, too, is probably a question of when, not if. But again, you'll be the second to know, after us.\nOperator: And we'll take our final question this evening from Robbie Ohmes of Bank of America.\nRobert Ohmes : It will be a real quick one, Richard. Can you just remind us, you're back to 15 net stores in the U.S., but what has to happen to go back to kind of the years where you would open kind of a net 25 a year in the U.S. and maybe relieve some of the pressure on the over-productive clubs in the U.S. right now?\nRichard Galanti : Yes. I think it's been a few years. I mean when we opened the net of 27 or 28, maybe low 20s or 22 or 23 were there. But we've been at maybe 16 or 17 out of 23-ish in the last few years. If you ask Craig, who's not in the room, but if you ask him, if we're opening a net of 24 this year, I think I said, what's the goal five and 10 years from now, probably to get it closer to 30 net. And probably by 5 years from now, it's 50-50 U.S. elsewhere -- versus elsewhere. That's the same answer I, by the way, said 5 years ago in terms of the split. But we'd like to see add 5 to that 24 in the next few years to go up a little bit higher. Certainly we have a lot of activity going on.\nRichard Galanti: Okay. With that, everyone, I'll thank you. Have a good holiday, and we're around to answer questions.\nOperator: Thank you, Richard. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude Costco's fiscal Q1 2023 Conference Call. Thank you all so much for joining us. I wish you all a great evening. Goodbye.\nRichard Galanti : Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Galanti",
            "content": "Thank you, Bo, and good afternoon to, everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal '23, the 12 weeks ended this past November 20. Reported net income for the quarter was $1.364 billion or $3.07 per diluted share. That compared to $1.324 billion or $2.98 a share last year. This year's results included a charge of $93 million pre-tax or $0.15 per share, primarily related to downsizing our charter shipping activities and a tax benefit of $53 million or $0.12 per diluted share related to stock-based compensation. Last year's results included an asset write-off of $118 million pre-tax or $0.20 per diluted share and a tax benefit of $91 million or $0.21 a share related to stock-based compensation. Additionally, the strength of the U.S. dollar resulted in our foreign company earnings translating into fewer U.S. dollars. With 25% to 30% of our earnings generally -- generated outside of the United States, this negatively impacted earnings by about $0.12 per share. In terms of sales, net sales for the first quarter increased 8.1% or $53.44 billion versus $49.42 billion reported last year. On a comparable sales basis during the first quarter, reported U.S. sales increased over the 12 weeks 9.3%; and excluding gas inflation and FX, 6.5%; Canada, 2.4%; reported 8.3% increase, ex gas inflation and FX. Other International reported minus 3.1%; excluding gas inflation, FX, plus 9.1%. So you have all told, 6.6% reported for the company, and ex gas inflation and FX of 7.1%. E-commerce, by the way, was reported of minus 3.7% and a minus 2%, excluding FX. In terms of first quarter comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 3.9% worldwide and up 2.2% in the U.S. Our average transaction size was up 2.6% worldwide and 6.9% U.S. during the first quarter. And foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by a little over 3%, while gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 2.5%. Moving down the income statement. Membership fee income reported in the quarter, our membership fee income came in right at $1 billion. That's $54 million or 5.7% higher than last year's reported number of $946 million. Again, the relative weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, excluding the impact of FX, we're assuming flat FX year-over-year, that $54 million number would have been increased by $32 million, and the membership on an adjusted basis would have been a little over 9% year-over-year on flat FX. In terms of renewal rates, at first quarter-end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rates were 92.5% compared to 92.4% a quarter ago. And worldwide rate came in both at this quarter-end and the previous quarter-end, the same level at 90.4%. We ended first quarter with 66.9 million paying household members and 120.9 million cardholders, both up 7% versus last year, and recognize we added about 22 units over the course of that last year. So that was about just under 3% of that increase. At Q1 end, paid executive memberships were right at 30 million, an increase of 904,000 during the 12 weeks or 75,000 a week during the first quarter. Executive members now represent 45% of our paid membership and just under 73% of worldwide sales. Moving down the income statement to gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the first quarter was lower year-over-year by 45 basis points and lower by 21 basis points, excluding gas inflation. And as I'll explain in a minute, the 93% pre-tax charge, excluding that 93% -- $93 million charge we took in the quarter, gross margin ex gas inflation would have been only down 3 basis points. As I always ask you, jot down the following numbers, two columns and six line items. The first column is reported during the first quarter, a year-over-year delta change in basis points, and the second column, excluding gas inflation. On a core merchandise basis, we reported in the first quarter, minus 52 basis points; and ex gas inflation, minus 31 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses, plus 23% on a reported basis and plus 30%; 2% reward, minus 2 and minus 5; LIFO plus 3 and plus 3; Other, that's the $93 million charge, minus 17 and minus 18. So all told, again, a reported basis was 45, ex gas inflation, 21. So starting with the core. Core merchandise's contribution to gross margin on a reported basis was lower by 52 basis points year-over-year and lower by 31 basis points ex gas inflation. In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in the first quarter, our core or core gross margin, if you will, was also lower by 31 basis points, with food and sundries being up a little bit, offset by non-foods and fresh foods being down. Fresh foods was down, as you know, for the last couple of years, it's been particularly strong, and it's come down a little bit. In addition, we are looking to hold prices on some of those price points despite inflated costs in some of the fresh food categories. Ancillary and other business gross margins were higher by 23 and higher by 30 basis points ex gas inflation in the quarter, with gas, business centers and travel up year-over-year, offset in part by e-comm, food courts and optical. Our 2% reward, minus 2 basis points; reported, minus 5%, excluding gas inflation, implying higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. LIFO, plus 3 basis points. We had a very small LIFO charge this year, but lapped a $14 million charge in Q1 last year. You recall last year, during the four quarters, we had LIFO charges in excess of $400 million pre-tax with a small amount that $14 million in the first quarter over $100 million in Q3 and over $200 million in Q4. So we'll see what inflation does this year. Hopefully, it will continue to -- its current trends in the right direction. Other, the minus 17 and 18 basis points reported in ex gas inflation. This is the $93 million charge, as mentioned in the earnings release, mostly related to downsizing our charter shipping activities. Over a year after COVID began, you will recall that the supply chain challenges related to shortages of the containers and shipping delays greatly intensified with container, freight and shipping rate skyrocketing. It was in Q4 of 2021 on our earnings call that we mentioned our initial leasing of 3 ships and several thousand containers to help mitigate these challenges. Later, we added 4 additional vessels and additional needed containers with commitments made for up to three years. Our objectives at the time were twofold: first, to increase the ability for more timely shipping and arrival of overseas merchandise. This allowed us to better stay in stock and drive sales; and second, to reduce some of the skyrocketing shipping and associated container costs. We achieved those objectives for a period of time. Over the course of a year, 1.5 years, we controlled the shipping and delivery of nearly 50,000 containers, many that would have been greatly delayed and at an estimated savings as compared to the then current shipping container costs of somewhere between $1,000 and $2,000 per container. That, of course, fluctuated. Now with a dramatic improvement in shipping times and much lower shipping and container costs, it made sense to downsize our commitment and lower prices for our members Moving on to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the first quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 35 basis points, coming in at a 920 compared to a year ago 955. And that plus 35 basis point improvement would be plus 13 basis point improvement, excluding gas inflation. Again, writing down six line items and two columns. First column being reported, second ex gas inflation. During the first quarter, our core operations was lower or better by 8 basis points, plus 8 then; without gas inflation, minus 9; central zero and minus 3; stock compensation, plus 3 and plus 1; preopening zero and zero; Other, plus 24 and plus 24; for a total first column reported year-over-year reported SG&A plus 35 or lower by 35 basis points and ex gas inflation lower by 13. Now going through those numbers, the core operations component of SG&A was again lower by 8 basis points reported, but higher by 9, excluding impact of gas inflation. These results include three sets of wage increases that were done in the past year plus as well as a little lower sales results in Q1 as compared to the prior quarter. Still increases, but a little lower than the prior quarter. Central was flat or zero and higher by 3, ex gas inflation. Stock comp, again, a little lower number in stock comp as a percent, so it came down, improved a little bit. Preopening, no impact. And the other, the 24 basis points you recall last year in Q1, this consisted of an asset write-off totaling $118 million pre-tax, which impacted the SG&A line last year. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $34 million this year, down $5 million or down from $39 million last year. And interest income and other for the quarter was higher by 11 year-over-year, $53 million versus $42 million a year ago. Interest income was higher year-over-year, offset by unfavorable FX. Overall, reported pre-tax income in the quarter was up 4%, coming in at $1.77 billion, compared to $1.696 billion a year ago. And excluding the charges described earlier in both years, pre-tax income was up around 3%. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q1 was 23.0% compared to 20.7% Q1 last year, so a little higher this year. Both years' tax rates benefited from the tax treatment of stock-based compensation, as mentioned earlier. The fiscal '23 effective tax rate, excluding these discrete items -- this discrete item, is currently projected to be between 26% and 27%. A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, we plan to open a net of 24 units this year, 27 openings, including 3 relocations, so net of 24. In the first quarter, the net of that 24 included 7. We planned 3 more in Q2, 4 in Q3 and 10 in Q4. In the first quarter, we opened, as I mentioned, 7 net new warehouses, 4 were in the U.S. and one each was in Korea, our first in New Zealand and our first in Sweden. Additionally, last week, we opened another building in the U.S. And just yesterday, we opened our 14th location in Australia, our second on the country's West Coast in or near Perth. In fiscal '23, again, 27 total new openings, including 3 locations for a net of 24. Of the net 24, it's made up of 15 in the U.S. and 9 in Other International, including our third and fourth locations in China. Regarding CapEx. In the first quarter, CapEx was approximately $1.06 billion. And our estimate for the entire fiscal year is CapEx of somewhere in the $3.8 billion to $4.0 billion range. Moving to e-commerce. E-commerce, as we mentioned in the press release, on a reported basis was -- for the quarter, year-over-year sales were minus 3.7 and minus 2 ex FX. Including sales -- what we don't include in this number is our sales through like same-day delivery for fresh foods with our partners like Instacart, which we don't include those, and they are fulfilled in our warehouse. Our e-comm comps, ex FX, would have been if we included it in the positive low single digits. Stronger departments in terms of year-over-year percentage increases were tickets and gift cards, tires, candy and health and beauty aids. The largest e-comm merchandise department majors, which includes consumer electronics and appliances, which represents over 40 -- close to 40% to 50% of our -- over 40% of our e-com volume was down in the high single digits. Subsequent to quarter end, we did have our two biggest e-comm selling days in our company history, both on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Now a few comments regarding inflation. Recall, we've seen some minor improvements in a few areas. Hopefully, continuing the comment I made last quarter's earnings call, a little light at the end of the tunnel, but it's still little. Recall last quarter in fourth quarter, we estimated that year-over-year price inflation was about 8%. In the first quarter, we estimate the equivalent year-over-year inflation number in the range of 6% to 7%. Food and sundries is still up more than non-foods, but overall, a little better level than a quarter ago for the company. And commodity costs are mostly coming down, whether it's corn flour, sugar and butter or even some things like steel. A few things are up, but overall, we're seeing a little bit of a trend, but we'll keep you posted. Switching over to inventory levels. Recall that our total inventory in both -- at the end of Q3 and at the end of Q4 on a year-over-year basis were up 26% year-over-year. I'm happy to report that good progress was made during the first quarter of this fiscal year. Our increase as of Q1 end dropped to a 10% year-over-year increase, largely driven by an estimated 6% to 7% inflation and about just under 2% year-over-year unit growth. So inventories, while we still have some pockets of a little over inventory, overall, we feel pretty good about it. As a reminder, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our December sales results for the 5 weeks ending Sunday, January 1 on Thursday, January 5, after the market closes. With that, I will open it up to Q&A and turn it back over to Bo. Thank you. No, I think the biggest thing, as I've said a couple of times in a quiet way, it rains on all of us during these tougher times, particularly with bigger ticket discretionary items. We're comparing against some huge increases a year ago, frankly, over the last two or three years, as you know. And that's where we've seen some of the slowdown. As I mentioned, e-comm consumer electronics and appliances, as I mentioned, was down high singles. I think in line was also down some amount. So that's where a big chunk of it is. When we look at food and sundries, that actually tends to be relatively strong for us. So overall, I think it's impacting us a little bit with what's going on out there. I think it is a combination of compared to very strong stuff a year ago as well as the fact that big ticket discretionary has a little bit of weakness. Yes. I have a couple of people in the room smiling. Of course, I can't tell you all that. But at the end of the day, first of all, if you look at our November reported numbers, the fact that those two dates -- those two high dates on e-com were in the last week. Keep in mind, e-comm is still a little under 10% of our total company, but that helped a little bit relative to e-comm in the last 4 weeks that we reported. But overall, look, we don't know what kind of trend it means. We feel pretty good about what we're doing in terms of driving sales. And as I mentioned, the food and sundries as we get past big-ticket discretionary purchases for the holidays, for Christmas and what have you, you'll have a higher penetration of some other things as well. As it relates to gas, for several quarters now, even beyond a year ago, we talked about the gas profitability for us and we believe our competitors -- other big chains of gas stations have made more in gas. And certainly, that's helped us use some of that to continue to hold prices where we can on some things. Who knows what the new normal is? What we know is that not only is gas more profitable than it has been in the past, and like I said the same thing a year ago, will that change at some point? Maybe. We don't know. So right now, it's good. And by the way, as we've mentioned a couple of times, we've seen strong gallon sales, and we're still taking market share. We -- when the U.S. gallon sales are generally close to flat, we're up in the 10% to 15% range in gallons. So we're driving people into the parking lot. And the fact that gallons of gas are profitable, that there's just a little bit more for us as well. So that's helped us. There's always things that are going to help us, and there's always going to be puts and takes. Well, I think, yes, LIFO was a slight pickup just because the dollar amount was less than the $14 million last year in the quarter. It's very slight. So if that continues, that would be good, and that would bode well. And you'd have -- I'm guessing you'd have a lot lower charge than $423 million, recognizing the big pickup was in Q3. The big hit was in Q3 and 4 when we saw the beginning of inflation rising. If inflation didn't go down, but it just stayed the same, in theory, you'd have no big charge. You have no additional charge. If it starts to go down from its peaks, that will have -- there'll be some LIFO income. Now mind you, some of that will be used for pricing as well. I mean, well, you know us. Yes. It was less than $1 million. Well, look, gas is just the sheer size of our gasoline business. It's been the biggest piece of that line for a few years. We have a -- it's a $30-plus billion -- on our $220-whatever-billion last year, we did in sales, I think a little over $30 billion was gas. So that's the big kahuna among all that stuff. I think we continue just to remain competitive. You've known us long enough when asked who is our toughest competitor, we look in the mirror, and we say it's us. So I think that as we drive market share, part -- we believe that part of it at least is due to the fact that we've continued to be very competitive. And so I don't know if there's any change in that. We -- notwithstanding where our numbers come out, we're always trying to push more into lowering the prices or keeping the price increases going not as high as they could have been. I think fresh foods is a good example of that of late, where, again, we've held the price points on certain items despite inflated costs, mostly in the protein area and a little bit in the bakery area. Well, good news is that's your job to model it. Look, at the end of the day, I think that the comment I made about big-ticket discretionary, while we sell big-ticket discretionary includes furniture, which we sell lawn and garden, patio, too, that's not right now at the holiday season necessarily. But that being said, there is a higher proportion of big ticket discretionary right now. And we're blessed in the sense that a big chunk of our business is fresh foods and food and sundries, which people have to eat. And as I mentioned, that has been strong throughout this. So I think overall, we'll probably still look at it in a positively relatively aggressive standpoint. Ultimately, when you talk about top line sales and if they're a little lower, what do we need? I think the question historically has always been asked, what do we need to have SG&A not go up as a percent of sales? And the view is -- and this is pre-inflation. The view is always you need something -- our best guess view is somewhere in the 4% to 5% comp range. If it falls below that, that will make SG&A a little bit of a challenge. That being said, we're pretty pragmatic, and we know how to use our margin as well. So I think overall, we'll continue to work entirely to drive top line sales and look at it for the long term. And we're not in any big way cutting back orders at this juncture, where we see some challenges with big-ticket discretionary? Does it come down a little? I think the keyword there is a little. And we're feeling very good about some of our business now despite what's going on out there. We're blessed that we think, again, I think as evidenced by gas and any food and sundries business, we're blessed by taking market share still. I think that's evidenced in our memberships and... I don't know exactly. I mean if we're three quarters of a year into it. I think if I recall, over the last two or three quarters, we've talked about like fresh being that way and probably exacerbated a little right now with the fact that we're trying to hold prices on some things that we think that, that's driving our sales. Beyond that -- I forgot the first part of the question now. Oh, yes. I think that -- yes, fundamentally -- first of all, in terms of overall, it's fundamentally fresh and then some non- foods. Some of that has to do with some of the big ticket things. If you've been online and saw some things we did during not just the week of Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, but we did some -- anywhere from $100 to $500 off on, I think, $500 cash card, if you bought $3,000 or more of these items. And so we're getting rid of some of the reason that 26% year-over-year inventory increase went to 10% was we got rid of some of the stuff that we -- some things that we had deep freeze and some things that we had delayed shipping during the supply chain challenge. So we did take some more markdowns than normal as you would expect, to help get rid of that. And hopefully, that's not a pressure point going forward. Certainly, I don't think it will be as much. And again, there are so many moving parts to this equation. I wish it was as easy as each basis point we could explain. We try to give you the rounded numbers. But overall, again, I get back to we feel good about how we're doing competitively. And we certainly understand that big ticket discretionary things have shown a little weakness, in part, because of our strength from a year ago, and in part, it's got to be part of the economy. And the good news is we have a big chunks of our business that are fresh foods, food and sundries, health and beauty aids, gas, all those types of things. And even other things like that's small, but travel has come back really strong from a really weak place a couple of years ago. Well, it certainly goes into the thought process. We're still not even to the average of the last three increases in terms of timing between the last one and the next one. What we've said again, and I'll say again, is that our view is all the parameters, as it relates to member loyalty and value proposition that we've improved to our member we have no problem thinking about doing it and doing it ultimately. So it's a question of when, not if. But we feel that we're in a very strong competitive position right now. And if we have to wait a few months or several months, that's fine. And I'll be purposely coy on when that might be. The last thing you said there is exactly, I think, why we chose to do a little more there. We want to be the most competitive, and we can drive a lot of volume. And again, we're in it for the long term. And it's -- fresh is one of those unique areas where prices on many items do change almost weekly on some of those items. If not sooner, if not more quickly. And so our buyers are always looking at the, if you will, the supermarket ads as well as the other warehouse club ads, not literally ads, but what the pricing is, and we react to that. But we're also -- part of it is also consciously keeping the price on the chicken at $4.99, and keeping -- and those types of things, keeping the price on the hotdog. All those things go into that equation as well. But we know that, that can be a driver of business. Fresh, we got great stuff, and people do notice the price. In our view, people notice those prices differences. Well, we don't -- what's that? No. Somebody in the room is telling me we were also up in terms of the average household incomes. So I think we're both seeing that. We know a lot of -- particularly of our executive -- our business members, in many cases, probably have both cards. They've always had both cards. And so no, we don't put our head in the sand as it relates to it, but we look at our numbers and how we're doing, and we've seen that the -- our penetration of higher income members has also benefited during this time. Before Oliver answers -- Oliver, before you ask a question, one other comment. One of the things that we have not done and don't plan to do is do a lot of promotional activities with our membership. And so that -- certainly, that will, in the short term, help drive membership, but we don't do a lot of that. Go ahead, Oliver. Sure. I wrote down non-food -- in terms of what's the new normal? Look, we don't know what the new normal is. I do know that we figure out how to drive total sales. I do know that over the last 2.5 years through COVID, people buying things for their home, whether it was indoor furniture, outdoor furniture, exercise equipment, electronics and appliances and it's even greater because of our acquisition in April of 2020 of the last mile, big and bulky delivery and installation arm from Sears, all that stuff has helped us dramatically. Look, a little bit is -- again, we don't know how much of it is just comparing against very strong numbers versus a little weakness. Our guess is a little above. We want to drive -- we always want to drive everything, but we want to drive more non-food things because you've got -- you don't need any extra space. If you're turning fresh foods at 50, 60 times a year or more, you're turning some non-food categories at 8 times a year. It's easy to go from 8 to 10 without any extra space in the building. So that's always been a goal of ours to drive both sides of the business, and we think we're pretty good at doing it. And this will be -- we'll find out what the answer is a year from now. On -- what was the other question? I'm sorry. Sure. Okay. On e-comm, again, that is even more dramatic if you look at what e-com did. We essentially doubled e-comm over a 12-month period from about worldwide from about 8 billion to 16 billion in that probably three or four months into COVID and then going fast forward a year. So the last half of fiscal '20 and the first half of fiscal '21, we had pretty good numbers over the last year. That, of course, dramatically impacted in a good way from our acquisition of Innovel. And doing, as I mentioned on the last earnings call, pre that acquisition in the U.S., we did about a little over 2 million drops, and a drop is anything from dropping off a sofa to dropping off and installing a washer dryer or a refrigerator freezer and taking the old one away.  We've gone from a little over 2 million drops. In fiscal '22, we did a little over 4 million drops, 70% of which is on the site and this operation that we acquired. So we've had outsized growth on that. Helped also not only by the acquisition but COVID itself. So we're comparing against that now. We'll see where that goes. We think that e-commerce still long term. First of all, as you know, we still want you to get into the warehouse as well. That's what -- so long term, we still think right now, we want to grow the e-commerce. I would say our goal still is to grow it a little more than in line right now because so much of it has been benefited by big ticket items, which have shown some weakness that's impacting a little bit right now. So -- but long term, we want to still be even 9% or 10% of $240 billion or $250 billion business here is a big chunk of business.  In terms of the last question, I'm sorry, I didn't write it down. Well, again, someone in the room here showed me that I think the data that somebody had asked me about where Walmart had indicated, we're all looking at that same data. We too saw the metrics of a little bit higher percentage of higher income people coming in, notwithstanding the fact that we start with a higher percentage to start with. That's -- we try to trade you up. And you know the quality of our merchandise, and we'd much rather sell you a bigger ticket item with all the bells and whistles. So I think that -- it's the way we merchandise, and we're not looking to change that at this juncture. Perhaps. I mean we still think anything that's even in the low single digits is great. And we benefited clearly from -- over the course of the last year, we benefited, as I've seen in our membership sign-ups, more people coming in and the gas business driving that a little bit as well. And just during COVID, we had a higher than previously average tick up and new member sign-ups. And so that's probably subsiding a little bit at this juncture. But again, we feel good -- very good about where our renewal rates are and then the loyalty that our members have. And we're pretty good at keep trying to figure out ways to get them in. We're doing -- we do online e-mails that are in-line directed for hot items to come in only available in store. And so those are the things that we continue to do. We haven't seen -- last quarter, I mentioned a couple of things on the fresh side and the protein side that we actually saw strength in canned chicken and tuna, which was the comment that the buyers made saying that we're seeing -- to the extent that prices were skyrocketing and some fresh protein, we saw strength in canned protein. We don't see currently a lot of trade down on fresh. Prices have started to come down on some of those items as the underlying commodity costs have come down a little bit. KS penetration is up. Our critical senior is up. I don't have the exact number in front of me. I'm guessing it's about somewhere approaching 1 percentage point, but -- which is big when it's, I would say, over the last several years, it's probably been 0.5 percentage point. But -- so probably up a little more than normal, but -- and again, we had -- somebody asked us the question recently, are you seeing some trade down to private label? And we, of course, corrected them and said it's a trade up. Yes. It's a moving target, honestly. It's based on rates, frankly, and rates right now have come down dramatically. So that would be a year, it could be a little longer than a year or a little less than a year, depending on what happens tomorrow. Well, I think the biggest thing continues to be we're better when study does sign up that they sign up in those countries where we offer executive membership, which is, I'm guessing, 85% of our company, more, maybe 90% of our company. It's just not in some of the smaller unit countries. And overall -- starting with the U.S., but overall in Canada, we do a better job of getting you to sign up as an executive member to start with. We also do a better job of getting you to sign up to auto renew with putting in your credit card. All those things help -- let's face it, all those things help, too. We know that an executive member buys more and shops more frequently in a year than a non-store member. We know that one of those members with a credit card, co-brand credit card shops even more frequently and spends more. And they do all 3, they're an executive member with a card versus being a regular member, that's the big kahuna here. And so I think that we've seen those trends go on over the last few years, frankly. And what's helped in the last year is the fact that, again, just our new member sign-ups has been higher than they had been historically over the last few years versus the last year -- last year or two. And I think we believe that's more because of COVID, and we were in a good place to shop. Is that in the Q? Okay. Yes, I can give it to you. Hold on a second. I didn't realize it's in the Q, which is not out yet. But what it is, is you've got a big increase in interest income and a big increase in FX downside. So of the 50 -- I think it was 53 is -- $54 million is interest income and the negative $1 million is other, which is a chunk of that's FX. And then this year, the $42 million -- I'm sorry, last year, it was $8 million of interest income and $34 million of other, the biggest piece of other being FX. So that added up to the $42 million. This year, the $53 million is $54 million of interest income and minus 1 of other. I think if you asked the buyers overall that there's a little less elasticity than there used to be on some of the things. Again, now that answer comes from the fact that my comments about big-ticket discretionary items. We've put more money behind it and that successfully cleaned up our inventory where we were over in some areas like furniture to some extent. But at the end of the day, I think in a year or two ago, we would have even guessed that could have been a little stronger. But then that gets back to the whole question is the economy -- the concerns in the economy impacting big-ticket discretionary items. So yes, I mean, there's clearly still elasticity. When we do temporary price discounts or even our MVM mailers, we still get good impact from it. Some things, the bigger the ticket, not as much as we used to get. Well, online, it's a little over 40. But online is only 9% of our sales. In store, I don't have it in front of me. 10 would be a good guess. And including that 10, furniture as well. So big -- and jewelry, big-ticket discretionary. Yes. Units are actually up. And there's normal deflation in TV electronics anyway. And -- but there is perhaps a little bit of smaller sizes are coming down a little bit. Not everyone wants an 85-inch television but -- which is where we over-index to bigger ticket stuff to start with. But we are seeing actual unit sales up. Yes. Yes. Well, first of all, we're seeing strength in sundries as part of what we call food and sundries, which is everything. Food and food and sundries is everything from canned beverages to crackers and cereal, and sundries, of course, paper goods and cleaning supplies and the like. And we're seeing strength in those areas. Those are -- those are actually strong, offset by some of the weakness I talked about on the non-food side. As it relates to regional, I don't -- we don't really see any big differences. I mean every month, you're going to see a region stronger or weaker. It has more to do in our view right now of late with weather than anything else. I can't give you anything definitive on what's -- is the region -- it's pretty -- they're all pretty close. Bob is saying here, they're within a couple of points of comp. The good news is our merchants are sitting here, holiday decor is fine. One example actually would be we have a small amount of air conditioners and fans, which was -- it was a hot summer, and we were very strong in it. There were delays some of the supply chain challenges, some of that stuff didn't come in until September. And needless to say, we're not going to put it out there and mark it down when nobody really is looking for an air conditioner unit in September. And so that's the example of a few things now. We still have some furniture. It's way down from where it had been. So very, very manageable. I think beyond that, there's nothing huge. And again, the big question right now would be the fact that from a standpoint of Christmas stuff, both the Christmas stuff as well as toys, we're in pretty good shape for that. We feel pretty good about that. We'll let you know next quarter. I mean we have a lot of levers, as you've mentioned, as you suggested, to pull and push. We're also aggressive on pricing when we want to be like in the fresh foods area that I just mentioned. And we're blessed right now with -- in some categories like gas that is a better margin. So all that stuff, again, there's a variety of puts and takes. We feel overall, there's nothing unusual about this quarter. And frankly, if inflation is not rising again, even if it doesn't go down, but it doesn't rise again from its current levels, we're in pretty good stead of greatly improving the component of margin that relates to a LIFO charge, particularly in Q3 and 4 when we had a $100-plus million number and a $200-plus million number. But that's to be seen, and we need to wait and see. That should help you a little bit. Sure. But as you might expect and one of the reasons we took this charge is we don't want to have to have the buyers worry about inputting higher costs into their -- if rates have come down and we contracted, we want to take some of that out. But that's still being worked through. That's not -- we have to continue to do that. Beyond that, as rates come down, you'll see our prices on items come down, too. Okay. Why don't we take two more questions? We have one every quarter. Look, we talked about both of those. In terms of the fee increase, I think over the last many years, we've probably done them at a time when things were particularly strong comp wise. The good news is during all times, renewal rates were strong and have gotten even stronger. We always look at ourselves in the mirror and feel that the value proposition has gotten better. That being said, we have done them -- I remember one time we were asked, it may have been back in '09, '10, during the Great Recession because I guess we did one probably in '11 or '12, which continued the Great Recession. And we'd be asked given the Great Recession, would you hold off on it? And our view was -- and comps were a little weaker back then, too, for at least a couple of quarters. And I think the comment I made was something to the effect, we'd probably do it anyway because we're going to use it to drive greater value in terms of pricing and everything in a big way. And so that really -- I think we've probably done it in times of lower comps or higher comps or good economy or tougher economy.  And I think with the headline in the -- I probably mentioned in the last quarter call or even the quarter before that, with the headline being recession question mark and inflation exclamation point, there's no rush. And first of all, even if we follow the pattern of the last three -- over the last 16 or so years, they averaged 5 years and 7 months. And I know now that 5 years and 7 months from June of '17 is January of '23. I know on the last call, I said, that doesn't mean it's going to be January '23. It will be -- it's a question of when, not if. But at this juncture, we'll just have to wait and see. And I'm not trying to be cute about it, but there's not a whole lot more I can tell you. There's no analytical framework we use other than we feel very good about our member loyalty and our strength. And if we wanted to do it yesterday, we could. If we want to do it six months from now, we can. So we'll wait and see. As it relates to the special dividend, as you know, we've said before, it's certainly an arrow in our quiver that has boded well for us, we believe. We think that's done well. We've done 4 of them. The last one was a couple of years ago, and we certainly do have cash. Mind you, when you look at our cash, about half of it's U.S. and not cash equivalents. And so certainly, we have the ability to do it at some point. I think we wanted to wait and see how things are continuing here. I think that, too, is probably a question of when, not if. But again, you'll be the second to know, after us. Yes. I think it's been a few years. I mean when we opened the net of 27 or 28, maybe low 20s or 22 or 23 were there. But we've been at maybe 16 or 17 out of 23-ish in the last few years. If you ask Craig, who's not in the room, but if you ask him, if we're opening a net of 24 this year, I think I said, what's the goal five and 10 years from now, probably to get it closer to 30 net. And probably by 5 years from now, it's 50-50 U.S. elsewhere -- versus elsewhere. That's the same answer I, by the way, said 5 years ago in terms of the split. But we'd like to see add 5 to that 24 in the next few years to go up a little bit higher. Certainly we have a lot of activity going on. Okay. With that, everyone, I'll thank you. Have a good holiday, and we're around to answer questions. Thank you."

As we turn the page on fiscal year 2024, let me make a few comments on our progress during the year as a whole. Throughout the fiscal year 2024, we will continue to execute on our strategy of growing the top-line through delivering the highest quality goods at the lowest possible price to our members. As a management team, we continue to be incredibly proud of our 333,000 employees worldwide and the culture that they foster. The consistency of our financial results is a reflection of the commitment of our entire team to member service and the Costco experience. Most of these employees are led by our fantastic warehouse managers, who we view as executives in our company. Succession planning continues to be a key focal point for us, as we're continually working on identifying the future leaders of our company. In fiscal year 2024, we promoted 95 new warehouse managers. 85% of those promoted, started at Costco as an hourly employee. This promote from within culture and the long-term career it helps to build is core to who we are as a company, community member, and retailer. A few other highlights I'd like to mention. In fiscal 2024, we hit our target of 30 new warehouse openings. This included one relocation and resulted in 29 net new buildings. Highlights included our first-ever building in Maine, bringing us to 47 states, and our 600th US Building in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. We also continue to see significant opportunities worldwide, and our fiscal 2025 plan has 12 of our planned 29 openings coming outside of the US, including our fifth building in Spain, which opened in Zaragoza two weeks ago. With three of these warehouses being relocations, we expect to add 26 net new buildings in fiscal 2025. We continue to grow our e-commerce business, and Costco Logistics has had a remarkable year. Appliances and furniture in big and bulky has led the way, and Logistics delivered over 4.5 million items this last year, up 29% over the year prior. Improvements in our items sortment, delivery times, and scheduling functionality all enhance the member experience. We have great momentum with this business and expect big and bulky items will be a key part of our continued progress with e-commerce in the coming year. Turning to technology, we're starting to realize the benefits from the work that was done this past year. Members are very excited about being able to check warehouse inventory via the Costco app. And the membership card scanners installed at the front doors have delivered on the goal of speeding up the checkout process. This has been very well received by our members. More improvements are currently underway, which should further benefit our business both online and in our warehouses. With that, I'll turn it back over to Gary to discuss the results for the quarter, and I'll jump back on during Q&A to field some questions.\nGary Millerchip : Thanks, Ron. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the 16 weeks ended September 1st. As we did last quarter, we published a slide deck on our investor site, under Events and Presentations, with supplemental information to support today's press release. You might find it helpful to have this presentation in front of you as I walk through our results. Throughout this discussion, when we're comparing to last year's fourth quarter, the best way to normalize for the extra week is to multiply last year's results by [16-17] (ph). Net income for the 16-week fourth quarter came in at $2.354 billion, or $5.29 per diluted share, up from $2.16 billion and $4.86 per diluted share in the 17-week fourth quarter last year. This year's results included a non-recurring net tax benefit of $63 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, related to a transfer pricing settlement and true-ups of various tax reserves. Reported net income was up 9% year-over-year. Excluding this year's non-recurring tax benefit and normalized for the extra week, last year, net income and earnings per diluted share were up 12.7% and 12.6% respectively. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $78.2 billion, an increase of 1% from $77.4 billion in the fourth quarter last year. Adjusting for the extra week last year, net sales would have been up 7.3%. The following comparable sales reflect comparable locations year-over-year and 16 comparable retail weeks. US comp sales were up 5.3% or 6.3% excluding gas deflation. Canada comp sales were up 5.5% or 7.9% excluding gas deflation and FX. And other international comp sales were up 5.7% or 9.3% adjusted. This all led to total company comp sales of plus 5.4% or plus 6.9% adjusted for gas deflation and FX. Finally, e-commerce comp sales were up 18.9% or 19.5% adjusted for FX. In terms of Q4 comp sales metrics, foreign currencies relative to the US dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 0.9%, while gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 0.6%. Traffic or shopping frequency increased 6.4% worldwide and 5.6% in the US. Our average transaction, or ticket was negative 0.9% worldwide and negative 0.3% in the US. This includes the headwinds from gas deflation and FX. Adjusted for those items, ticket would have been positive 0.5% worldwide and positive 0.6% in the US. Moving down the income statement to membership fee income, we reported membership fee income of $1.512 billion, an increase of $3 million, or 0.2%, on one less week year-over-year. FX negatively impacted membership fee income by 0.9%. Excluding the impacts from the extra week last year, and FX normalized membership fee income was up 7.4%. In terms of renewal rates, at Q4 end, our US and Canada renewal rate was 92.9%, down one-tenth of a percent from Q3 end. This slight decrease related to an online membership promotion that we ran for a short period in fiscal year 2023, which resulted in over 200,000 new sign-ups. As those members entered the renewal rate calculation during Q4 fiscal year 2024, the lower renewal rates for that cohort, which is typical for digital promotions, had a negative impact on the overall US renewal rate. Outside of those sign ups, there were no meaningful changes in the US renewal rate. The worldwide rate came in at 90.5%, the same as Q3, with improvement internationally offsetting the slight negative in the US. We ended Q4 with 76.2 million paid household members, up 7.3% versus last year, and 136.8 million cardholders up 7% year-over-year. About half of new member signups in fiscal year 2024 were under 40 years of age. This percentage has been growing since COVID, and has lowered the average age of our member over the last few years. At Q4 end, we have 35.4 million paid executive memberships, up 9.6% versus last year. Executive members now represent 46.5% of paid members and 73.5% of worldwide sales. Turning to gross margin. Our reported rate in the fourth quarter was higher year-over-year by 40 basis points, coming in at 11% compared to 10.6% last year and up 33 basis points, excluding gas deflation. Core was lower by 5 basis points and lower by 11 basis points without gas deflation. In terms of core margins on their own sales, our core-on-core margins were higher by 9 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses' gross margin was higher 44 basis points and higher 42 basis points, excluding gas deflation. This increase year-over-year was driven by gas and e-commerce. E-commerce benefited from strong sales growth, item mix, and fulfillment productivity. And gas margins benefited from some moderate tailwinds and lapping a slightly weaker quarter last year, but nothing as significant as the benefit in Q1 2024, as a result of the volatility from world events in that quarter. 2% rewards was higher by 4 basis points or 3 basis points without gas deflation, reflecting higher sales penetration from our executive members. And LIFO was a benefit of 5 basis points. We had an $8 million LIFO credit in Q4 this year compared to a $30 million charge in Q4 last year. Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A rate in the fourth quarter was higher year-over-year by 8 basis points, coming in at 9.04% compared to last year's 8.96%. SG&A was higher by 2 basis points adjusted for gas deflation. The operations component of SG&A was higher 4 basis points, but was flat excluding gas deflation. Higher wages went into effect for the last six weeks of the quarter in the US and Canada, which was a headwind for the quarter of approximately 4 basis points. Investing in our employees remains a key part of our strategy, and we will continue to focus on driving top-line sales and improving productivity to mitigate the incremental costs. Central was higher by 3 basis points and 2 basis points without gas deflation. Stock compensation was flat year-over-year, and pre-opening was higher 1 basis point but flat without gas deflation. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $49 million versus $56 million last year, reflecting $1 billion of debt paydown in the second-week of Q4 this year. Interest income for the quarter was $138 million versus $201 million last year, primarily due to the $6.7 billion special dividend paid in January 2024. Interest income will continue to be a headwind in the first half of this year due to lower year-over-year cash balances and lower interest rates. FX and other was an $18 million loss this year versus a $37 million gain last year. This was primarily due to foreign exchange. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q4 was 24.4%, compared to 27.1% in Q4 last year. As mentioned earlier, this year's rate benefited from $63 million of net tax discrete items. Adjusted for this benefit, the tax rate for the quarter would have been 26.4%. Turning now to some key items of note in the quarter. We opened 14 new warehouses in the fourth quarter, 10 in the US, 2 in Japan, and 1 each in Korea and China. Capital expenditure in Q4 was approximately $1.58 billion, bringing the total year spent to $4.71 billion. Taking a deeper look into core merchandising sales, once again, non-foods led the way with the highest comparable sales in Q4. Our buyers have done a fantastic job finding new and exciting items at great values. Golden jewelry, gift cards, toys and seasonal, home furnishings, tires, and housewares all were up double digits in the quarter. Health and beauty aids also performed well, as we have expanded and elevated that category with new high-end SKUs, both online and in warehouse, including assorted luxury fragrances at a 30% to 70% value to retail. Across the fresh departments, we saw high single digit growth, as our continued focus on value is resonating with our members. An example of this in the meat department is our Kirkland Signature boneless chicken tenderloins, where we lowered the price 13% and saw a 21% lift in pounds sold. In food and sundries, the introduction of more international food products such as paneer cheese, Punjabi cookies, and fried tofu kimbap are resonating extremely well with our members. We're also delivering greater value by adding some new Kirkland Signature items, such as our KS Organic Golden Maple Syrup and KS aerosol whipped cream. Kirkland Signature offers significant member value compared to the national brands and continues to grow at a faster pace than our business as a whole. Our goal is always to be the first to lower prices where we see the opportunities to do so. And just a few examples this quarter include KS Standard Foil, reduced from $31.99 to $29.99, KS Macadamia Nuts, reduced from $18.99 to $13.99, KS Spanish Olive Oil, 3 liter, reduced from $38.99 to $34.99, and KS Baguette 2-Packs reduced from [$5.99 to $4.99] (ph). Our commitment to sustainability and achieving lower emissions is also presenting opportunities to lower our costs. A great example of this is our KS laundry packs, which we recently converted from a rigid plastic tub to a pouch. This allowed us to reduce the plastic packaging by 80% and pass these cost savings onto the member, lowering the price by $1 from $19.99 to $18.99. We've also found success working with suppliers to localize production of bulky items, such as water, paper, and laundry detergents. By manufacturing these goods closer to the countries in which they're sold, both costs and emissions associated with the shipment of these goods are greatly reduced. This quarter, we introduced our new Japan-produced Kirkland Signature paper towels. In addition to the emissions benefits from no longer shipping millions of units of paper towels from the US to Asia, the reduced freight allowed us to lower the price by approximately 30%, or $8 per unit in that market. As production ramps up, we are in the process of transitioning our other Asian markets to locally produce skews. Shifting the production country of this one product will result in annual member savings of $30 million. Within ancillary businesses, pharmacy have the strongest sales percentage increase, driven by double digit growth in script counts. Our optical department also performed well, as more members have taken advantage of the exceptional values in brand name frames and sunglasses. On a like-for-like 16-week basis, gas sales were negative low single digits in the quarter as a result of the average price per gallon being 5% lower. This was partially offset by gallon growth of 3%. Inflation was once again effectively flat in the quarter across all core merchandise. Food and sundries and fresh foods were slightly inflationary and this was offset by deflation in non-foods. In the supply chain, we are seeing good flow of products through Panama and Baltimore. The Red Sea is a remaining pain point and is causing some relatively minor shipping delays. Product availability has generally been good with a few exceptions. Egg supplies are still being negatively impacted by avian influenza and prime beef and a handful of vegetable SKUs have been tight. As Ron shared earlier, we are pleased with the momentum in our digital business and continue to make good progress with our technology priorities. Our app was downloaded 3.5 million times in the quarter, bringing total downloads to approximately 39 million, and we recently upgraded the native search function on our US mobile app, leading to a doubling of the click-through rate on search results. E-commerce traffic, conversion rates and average order value were all up year-over-year, helping to drive another strong quarter of comparable sales growth. While continued strength in bullion, was a meaningful tailwind to e-commerce comps, appliances, health and beauty aids, tires, toys, gift cards, hardware, housewares, home furnishings, optical and pharmacy all grew double digits year-over-year. The rollout of buy online and pickup in warehouse for TVs in the US market was also completed in Q4. This allows same-day pickup of a new TV for members who prefer not to wait for delivery. While buy online pickup in warehouse isn't cost effective for us on lower-priced items, for high-value items with high shipping costs like TVs, the freight savings more than offset the added labor, required in warehouses to fulfill those orders. We're now testing a similar program on laptops. Costco Next, our curated marketplace, while still small, continued to grow nicely in the quarter. We added 11 new vendors, bringing the total to 86 and adjusting for the extra week, gross sales grew nearly 40% year-over-year. A brief comment on the membership fee increase that went into effect on September 1. Due to deferred accounting, this will have minimal impact early in the year. The vast majority of the benefit will come in the back half of fiscal year 2025 and into fiscal year 2026. With that being said, our commitment to invest in our employees and members is continuous as evidenced by the July wage increase and lower prices such as the example shared on today's call. In closing, we are encouraged by our momentum exiting fiscal year 2024 and are excited about the growth opportunities ahead as we continue to execute our strategy of delivering exciting new items and greater value for members, innovating with Kirkland Signature and growing our warehouse footprint and digital capabilities globally. In terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, October the 6th on Wednesday, October 9th after market close. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now open the line up for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimeon Gutman: Questions. On the previous earnings call, there was a discussion about the possibility of greater SG&A leverage in the future as a lot of foundational investments have already been made shortly after Costco announced a membership fee increase and reinvestment into employee wages as well. While wage investments are clearly the right thing for the business and instrumental for Costco's culture and success, how should we reconcile this potential posture of driving more leverage but also adopting the same prior approach of putting upside back into wages.\nGary Millerchip: Hi, yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. As we think about our overall model for the company, our focus is on really achieving a balance across the business. And as you know, over the years, what we've done successfully at Costco is, continue to invest in members, continue to invest in lowering prices and value for our members and continuing to invest in our employees. And we believe that's going to be a critical part of our overall strategy going forward to make sure that we keep driving our top-line sales growth. You're absolutely right, during the quarter. And in fact, I think 3 times during the year, we shared -- we made various investments in our employees back in September 2023, we announced an increase in the starting wage. And then in March this year, we announced that we were increasing wages for a number of our managerial roles in the warehouses. And as you mentioned, we recently announced a further increase for all of our hourly employees in the warehouses and across our distribution network. And so from our perspective, we think that's an important part of continuing to support the top-line growth in the company. As you saw in the quarter, when you adjust SG&A for gas deflation and for looking particularly at the operational part of the business, the good news was we were able to effectively offset that cost -- those cost increases by driving productivity and driving sales leverage. And I think we've done that pretty consistently over time. And our expectation of ourselves is that we'll continue to do that. So I think for us, it's less about giving specific guidance on a particular measure but more looking over the long term of how we expect to be able to keep making those investments, but also driving leverage in our model to ensure we're sustainably driving top-line and driving profitable growth. Ron, anything you'd like to add?\nRon Vachris: No, I have to agree with you, Gary.\nSimeon Gutman: Got it. That's really helpful. And just as a quick follow-up, can you speak to the impact of the card readers at the different stores you've rolled out so far? Should we be modeling potentially a lift in member counts or growth in addition to the MFI bump from the fee increase as well?\nRon Vachris: This is Ron. The purpose of the card readers at the front door, this is a system we've been using for over two years now in Europe and especially in the UK and we've piloted here in the US for about six months. Several different benefits for it. It gives our operators real-time traffic counts throughout the day. So we're able to adjust front-end lines that we need to open and close lines based on the fluctuations of business. We can monitor our fresh foods a little better because we know what the traffic counts look like and so forth. And it has also taken the friction of membership verification away from the front-end registers and move that to the front door, where we're able to look at people's membership status. We let them know if their renewals is due before they get to the front-end. So we've realized some very nice, healthy front-end improvements in productivity, and it's allowed our operators to manage the business much better throughout the day.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nChris Horvers: Thank you. Good evening. I\u2019m going \u2013 hopefully you can hear me. The question is can you talk about the risk around the port strike that's emerging here. What percentage of the product do you -- comes through those defected ports. Any description on maybe the categories that are more exposed versus the others? And to what extent have you tried to bring in product early for the holidays to try to manage that risk?\nRon Vachris: Yes. This is Ron again. Yes, I'll take that question. The port strike is something we've been watching very closely for some time. We knew about the timing of this as well. When you think about the impact to our business, we import primarily nonfoods and some limited food and sundries come in, but nonfoods is less -- about 25% of our total business and only a subset of that is important. There's some domestic goods in there as well that are not imported in nonfoods. We have done a little bit of everything that you spoke about. We've got contingency plans, we've cleared the ports, we've pre-shipped. We've done several different things that we could to get holiday goods in, ahead of this time frame and looked at alternate plans that we could execute with moving goods to different ports and coming across the country if needed. It could be disruptive based on how impactful, I can't tell you until we know length and what could happen out there. But it is in our sights. Our buyers are all over it. They're watching it closely, and we've taken as many preemptive measures as we could to prepare for this.\nChris Horvers: And then just as a quick follow-up. As you think about the risk around ocean freight rates, is your expectation that freight rates are maybe elevated right now because of all this and perhaps come down into next year as we think about contract renewal periods? Thanks.\nRon Vachris: I'm not good at predicting the future, but I can tell you that from what we're seeing a big chunk of our freight comes in under contract. So we've been insulated from that. The spot market has peaked in the last quarter. We see that coming off now. If a port disruption could happen or something else could happen in the Red Sea, could that go up? Absolutely, it could go up. But from what we're seeing now, the spot market did increase is coming off at this point. And again, our team did a great job by insulating us with good solid contracts for this year.\nChris Horvers: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.\nChuck Grom: Thanks. Good afternoon, Gary and Ron, just to go back to the membership card scanners. Can you just speak to where you are on the rollout of that across the US? And any positive reactions you've seen so far? Our checks have shown that in some locations you guys are actually seeing a double-digit increase in new sign-ups.\nRon Vachris: Yes. We have about 350 US warehouses rolled out at this point and through the process, reaction has been very positive. Myself, all our operators, and we really rely on feedback of our warehouse managers and what's been done. And our head operator, Russ Miller, and myself have been met with great positive reactions both from the members and from the operators as well. We have seen some lift in member sign-ups from that. We have also seen a lift in renewals because before people get to the front end, now they're aware that my renewal is going to be due when I get to the registers, so members are very appreciative about that. They know that and they get up to the front, and they're not shocked by that process as well. So improved productivity, improved interaction. And as we know, as our volumes grow, we're looking for everything we can find to use technology to help get our members through the front ends in a good, smooth manner.\nChuck Grom: That's very helpful. And then my follow-up, just, Gary, on the other business line and within the margin build up 42 basis points ex-gas. Can you add a little bit of color on the sequential change? How much came from e-comm or how much came from the improvement in gas margins? Thank you.\nGary Millerchip: Sure. Yes, we called those two out because they were the two biggest factor in the results. I think of them as being relatively similar in terms of the impact. E-commerce actually has been a nice trend that we've seen for the last couple of quarters. We've been really pleased with the momentum in e-commerce. Of course, the headline sales growth has been very positive, which is a great starting point. But then the team's done a really nice job of improving fulfillment, efficiency and driving better sell-through in terms of the product and the inventory management as well. And the mix has improved. As I mentioned, on the prepared remarks, we've seen really good growth, really a balance across the board around e-commerce growth. So e-commerce has been a sort of a sustained trend that we've been pleased with the last couple of quarters. On the gas side of things, it was really -- I wouldn't say there was anything unusual during the quarter. It was really more a case that we had a little bit of tailwind in margin. And as I mentioned earlier, we're cycling some lighter margin in the same quarter in 2023.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Cheatham: Hi, everyone. This is Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. Thank you Gary and Ron. I want to talk about new store growth. You mentioned 26 net in 2025, with I guess, an increasing focus on international. Anything you can share on why the US would step down from 24 levels? Should we think about international being a more important growth vertical for you? And then on the US side, how many of those are new markets versus infill where you're trying to alleviate traffic congestion from a nearby store?\nRon Vachris: On the international to domestic new openings, it really is based on timing through the system. I mean, in larger markets, we may have a building that's taken us three years to get to fruition, where some markets move quite quickly. So there is no specific plan that we have. We put the buildings in queue. We agree that we're going to go there. And then it's following the process all the way through to how utilities come along, infrastructure, those types of things. As far as the outlook on international versus domestic growth, it's pretty balanced, again, more of a timing thing than anything. I think we've got 12 next year that will be outside of the US. And we've got some -- you could imagine in some countries, it takes us a few more years to get a building opened up. So it really is about the cadence of them opening. But we continue to look forward that we feel pretty good, balanced growth. We see infills as being very positive for us, both in US, Canada and all of North America that we have plenty of opportunities for infills in North America for the next several years ahead. And then a good market of new regions of the world. I don't think we have anything lined up for next year but new markets. I'd say that we're probably looking at 5 to 6 new markets that we'll be expanding into next year.\nBrandon Cheatham: Got it. Okay. Thanks. And just one follow-up on the [MFI fee] (ph) increase. I know you all typically reinvest in the member experience and price. And I think we already talked about wages. How should we think about the timing of that? Because you realize the MFI fee increase over a longer period? Is there any near-term pressure that might flow through the P&L as you do kind of focus on delivering that value to the member after you've increased that fee?\nGary Millerchip: Sure. Yes, thanks for the question. We mentioned a couple of these things in the prepared comments, too, but we certainly think about as we increase the membership fee, our goal is always to find ways to deliver more value for the member. And we think about that pretty holistically. It can be lowering prices. It can be launching new Kirkland Signature products. It's also investing in ways that we can improve member experience and some of the things that Ron mentioned earlier. And we believe a critical part of delivering a better experience for our members is also in employee wages. So we very much look at it holistically and how do we make sure we feel confident that we are delivering more value to our members over time. And some of those things that you heard in Q4, we've already started that journey with some of the wage increases and some of the ways in which we've been able to lower prices and deliver more value through new Kirkland Signature products in the quarter. To answer maybe the broader question that you mentioned, as you know, we generally don't provide guidance as part of our updates for the results of the company. That being said, I would say, overall we feel very good about our momentum ending fiscal year '24. And as we head into the new fiscal year, we feel very good about the opportunity ahead of us. As always, we've set ourselves high internal expectations for how we expect to grow the top-line and to do so profitably. And we'll be doing that by continuing to invest in member value and employees while driving efficiencies and leverage. And we still see many opportunities to find ways to improve gross margin and SG&A in terms of opportunities to fund those investments. We wouldn't normally comment on cadence for the year ahead either. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there are a few unusual items this year with the deferred accounting for the membership fee increase, as you mentioned. And that will generally sort of really the most part of that will come in, in the second half of 2025 and the first half of 2026. And then there were also a couple of specific factors to Q1, namely the interest income, where we'll be cycling higher cash balances and higher interest rates from last year and gas profit, while it is really been pretty stable over the years, there was certainly some volatility due to world events in Q1 last year. So the one thing I think I would say is that as you think about our cadence of our earnings growth across '25, it's likely to be less linear than you would probably typically expect.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nJohn Heinbockel: And Gary, I wanted to start with -- I think you said right, core-on-core was up 9 bps. What was the color by product category of fresh foods, sundries and non-food?\nGary Millerchip: Yes. Food and sundries were slightly negative. Fresh was slightly positive and non-food was the strongest of the three, which was really, again I think, from the mix perspective and the strong sell-through in the year, but that was sort of the breakout of it, John.\nJohn Heinbockel: And then maybe second for both of you guys. How do you -- when you think about Kirkland Signature, you talked about -- you gave some price decreases that you've taken and all of those that you cited anyway were Kirkland Signature. So maybe talk about that, those price decreases maybe versus brand name product. Where Kirkland signature penetration is now? And is that business because you're getting scale -- is that just becoming a lot more profitable than it used to be or you're trying to manage to a flatter -- an unchanged margin on Kirkland Signature?\nRon Vachris: I guess I'll take that one. We continue to see the penetration grow. And it's in the high 20s now as it continues to grow as our penetration across the board goes. We are not only seeing investment in price in Kirkland Signature. But with Claudine and her team, they have a commitment that if we're going to expect that of our suppliers, we're going to start with setting that example and showing the benefits of investing in price and driving unit volume. So we are doing that, but we are also seeing great support from our suppliers and our partners around the world. That are also interested in driving their business and using Costco as that partner to get that done. So we continue -- I think we've got some great items coming up this next year in Kirkland Signature that will continue to enhance that value proposition to our members and continues to build the loyalty with our members because this is a place you come to get Kirkland Signature. So we see good things coming. We see the penetration continue to grow, and we continue to see the value and the benefits to the members improving over time. Gary, if you would --.\nGary Millerchip: Yes, maybe, Ron, just to add to the comment also, John, you were asking around the margin opportunity. Obviously, we stay very disciplined about -- we have a cap on the margin that we expect to make on a Kirkland Signature product. But as that mix continues to grow, it definitely creates some overall tailwind in our margin overall. And I mentioned a couple of examples in the prepared comments. We're also seeing some really great opportunities as we're thinking more globally across our merchandising team is really working together and finding ways to buy more efficiently and in-country production that we mentioned. So when you take all those combined, I think that's creating opportunity for us to win-win in the sense that we can create more value for the member, stick within our commitments around the margins that we work within, but I do think it creates tailwinds and ways to balance the investment in the member while continuing to grow long term.\nJohn Heinbockel: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nScott Ciccarelli: Hi, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. Another question on the ID scanning. Any feel for how often nonmembers were shopping at Costco? And then secondly, just given some of the price reductions that you highlighted earlier, can you comment on your broader inflation and deflation expectations for fiscal '25? Thanks.\nRon Vachris: As far as the scanning, I really couldn't give you a number. I mean, we've been exclusive for -- since the inception of the company that we're exclusive to members. There are shop cards and those type of things that people come in with. But I really couldn't give you a set number of what percent of people coming in are non-members. And as far as inflation, I think Gary is signing, that he'd like to take that one.\nGary Millerchip: Yes, happy to. Probably similar to Ron's comment earlier, I don't know we would be particularly good at telling you what we forecast for the market overall, but what I can maybe give you some a little bit more color from what we're seeing, Scott from our perspective, we shared for the quarter overall inflation was essentially flat. We saw a little bit of inflation in fresh. That was mainly driven by produce right now. That was sort of the key category there that drove -- but again very low inflation, nothing meaningful to talk about. We're still seeing it very quiet in terms of the inflationary impact on prices and on the business. Food would have been slightly inflationary as well, but it's a remarkable actually how a small range now between the different categories, really nothing between positive 2% and negative 2% and sort of all coming back out to even just very slightly inflationary. But nothing much there either that we're seeing. We are seeing more of a mixed view on commodities. Things like corn and flower and sugar are all deflationary, which is causing the bakery category as a whole to be deflationary. But then on things like butter and cocoa and eggs, as I mentioned earlier on the call, and cheese, we're seeing more inflation. So I don't know that we're seeing anything today that's causing us to believe that where we are today is what the world looks like. And our goal, of course is always to find ways to lower our costs and therefore, hold prices down for our members. So I wouldn't say that we are seeing anything dramatically different from how our quarter looked for this quarter. But of course, like everybody we're susceptible to shocks and changes that can happen in the market.\nScott Ciccarelli: Helpful. Thanks a lot guys. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] on for Michael Lasser. Thanks very much for taking our questions. While it's early, what has been the customer response to the MFI increase? And do you expect to see a rise in customer attrition? Why or why not? Thanks.\nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question. As you are familiar with the membership fee increase, we were very deliberate about the timing. In fact, we are really delayed by 2 years from when we've traditionally increased the fee every 5 years and that was initially because of what we thought our members were experiencing with COVID and then we saw higher inflation. So we were very deliberate in delaying the increase until we felt that we started to see inflation dissipate and our members were spending more in non-food categories seeing that they were coming through the inflationary period. From a member reaction perspective, I'd say, we haven't really heard a significant member reaction. Our membership renewal rates. There's no real change in trend, as I mentioned in some of my prepared remarks. I think the fact that we've been able to stave off inflation on things like the hot dog pricing at $1.50 and the rotisserie chicken at $4.99. And generally, demonstrating the way that we're lowering prices for members wherever we can. I think there's been a recognition that in the context of what's happened more broadly over the last seven years that we stayed true to our principles of really trying to help the member and deliver the value. And as we mentioned earlier on the call, we\u2019ve been making investments, whether it be in wages for our employees in lowering cost to show our members that we want to make sure that the increase is delivering value to them.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.\nRupesh Parikh: Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. So just on the consumer front, just curious how you guys are feeling about the health of your consumer? And then any changes in consumer behavior of note during the quarter?\nGary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Rupesh. I think we see the consumer or member through a course through our lens. And what I would say is that it is very clear that quality and value have never been more important. That's something that has very clearly coming through in our insights and how we're seeing our members shop. I think the encouraging thing for us is, as you know, as you look at our trends in the year-to-date, we have seen that as inflation has dissipated, our members have started to spend more on non-food items, which is really encouraging in our mind. And what we're really pleased about is the widespread nature of that across the different categories that we've seen in non-foods. I would say that on some categories like appliances and electronics, definitely, they've become more promotional over time. That would be a factor, I think, that members are looking for more deals. And for us, of course, we are always going to be there on price, but we also include within what we're offering to our members, the installation and the removal of the old product, if that's necessary in the delivery. So we kind of trend to try and differentiate there on the overall experience as well as being a great everyday low value. I think they're the kind of key trends in non-foods. On the food side of things, we've definitely seen some signals that would suggest that members and consumers in general are maybe shifting a little bit of spend from food away from home to food at home. Under the food and the sundry side of our business, alcohol would still be relatively soft. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're seeing really strong growth in our ethnic food categories and also in Kirkland Signature products, particularly in the new ones that we've been introducing. And then on the fresh side of things, really strong growth across meat, produce and bakery. I would say we've certainly seen a continued acceleration in some of those lower-cost protein items like poultry, cheaper cuts of beef like ground beef and pork. So there is definitely some signs that the consumer is being very choiceful in how they are spending their dollars. But thankfully, with the quality and value that we're offering is definitely resonating with our members.\nRupesh Parikh: Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. Big focus out there on alternative revenue streams, including media. Just curious on the latest on the efforts from Costco. And is there more -- is there maybe a more aggressive push in growing that area?\nGary Millerchip: Yes. I think we still see it as a significant opportunity. It\u2019s definitely a journey for us. It\u2019s the foundations of that journey are getting our technology infrastructure in a position where we feel really good about the capabilities that will allow us to deliver to the member in terms of the offers that we can give to them and the level of targeting and personalized capabilities that creates. We\u2019ve already started to build out those plans and starting to identify how we can capture low-hanging fruit where there are opportunities. But we would see it as a significant opportunity over the long term, to drive new revenue. We will approach this probably a little bit differently than many others \u2013 we\u2019ll be reinvesting the vast majority of those dollars as we always do to drive top line growth. And we think that will be a competitive advantage with our CPG partners because it will show them that every dollar they\u2019re spending is really intended to drive overall growth for the company. That being said, I do think it will help also with e-commerce business is typically less profitable, on this case, a way to offset some of those costs in delivery and fulfillment as well.\nRupesh Parikh : Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKelly Bania: Hi, good evening, Gary and Ron. Just wanted to ask about e-commerce, obviously, continued strength there. Just can you just give us a broad update on the penetration, the profitability and how that is impacting margins at this growth level? And just an update on what the penetration would be if you included Instacart, like others do in that penetration?\nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks, Kelly. As we look at the progress, we're really pleased with the momentum that we've seen in digital. Actually, we were looking at the data recently over a 10-year period, and we've grown our compounded annual growth rate in e-commerce, it's been over 20% for that 10-year period. So it's been a significant growth story for us and members clearly evaluating the additional ways in which we're giving them opportunities to find new deals and value for the member. Overall, it would be -- the penetration will be in the sort of high single-digit range based on how we report e-commerce today. If you kind of -- to your point earlier, we don't include some of those digitally started sales transactions, if I could say it that way. So Instacart, Uber, the ways in which members might be buying groceries and food and sundries. If you added those in, and of course, we also include gas in our total sales, we would be into the double-digit penetration when you include all those elements in the number.\nKelly Bania: Okay. And any comments on profitability and how that's -- how e-commerce is impacting profitability?\nGary Millerchip: Yes. I would still say it's marginally, it's lower than the traditional shopping in the warehouse, and that's obviously intuitively makes sense given that we're doing more of the picking and shopping for the member. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we have seen some good improvements as we've grown our sales numbers, that's created some leverage in the model. We\u2019re improving the efficiency of our fulfillment costs. So it is continuing on an improving trend over time because of the sales growth and the leverage that\u2019s creating, but also some of the improvements the team are making in the business to drive more efficiency as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Baker: Great. Thanks. Two questions. One, can you talk about competitive pricing, particularly in grocery. There's been a lot of talk about some grocery chains investing in price, et cetera. What are you seeing how your price gaps? And then I'll have a follow-up after that. Thanks.\nGary Millerchip: Yes, thanks for the question. I think the key thing for us is we're our own biggest competitor. As you heard us mention earlier, we want to be the first to lower prices and the last to raise prices. And at every one of our regular budget meetings, we're talking about how can we find ways to do that. And the majority of our price investments are proactive, not that we're reacting. But of course, we're always watching and staying very close to competition. I would say that the promotional environment has been increasing. That would be with us, as Ron mentioned earlier, that our CPG partners are investing to find ways to drive units, and that would certainly be the case across some of the competition as well. I mentioned earlier, appliances and consumer electronics would be an area where we've seen more of that activity. But I think if you took it all on balance, we wouldn't say that we're seeing the activity sort of outside of normal in the food space. And we feel very good about our position relative to the market and continue to be proactive in finding ways to provide the best quality, best value for our members.\nMichael Baker: Excellent. That makes sense. Follow-up when gas prices fall, I think gas prices are down now 15%, 16% year-over-year, broadly speaking, at least in the latest data. Does that hurt your traffic at all? Because I think you guys say 50% of people will come to get gas -- come into the club and buy something, I think the unit growth -- the gallons growth did decelerate a little bit this quarter. Is that something that you guys look at or have any concern over?\nRon Vachris: Yes. This is Ron. I don't see it as a concern. Gallons were up 3%, which was a little bit softer than the prior quarter. So when you do hit those peaks in prices, we will see a greater attraction to the Costco gas stations. But our balance of transactions, dual transactions that we have looks very positive. And so we're not seeing traffic dropping off at all in the warehouse based on the slightly softer gallon growth that we're seeing out in the gas stations.\nMichael Baker : Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nKaren Short: Hi, thanks a lot. And good to talk to you again. So thanks for taking my question. So my question is, when you look at your pre-tax margin, I know you don't manage to that in any way, shape or form. But it obviously has been creeping up. So when you look at the actual delta on a 10 basis point increase in that margin, it's not immaterial to get to earnings and/or valuation, obviously. So wondering how you think about that.\nGary Millerchip: Hi, Karen, I think the way we think about it is really back to some of the comments that we were referring to earlier is that our goal is always to drive top line. That's the top priority for the company, and we're focused on investing and delivering value for the member and delivering improved investments in our employees as well to make sure that we're an employer of choice. I think I appreciate the comment because I think, we have been successful over the years in doing that because there are ways for us to continue to lower our costs in our gross margin part of our business and drive more value for the member. Some of the things that we've been focused on, like global buying and the Kirkland Signature growth that we've seen, e-commerce growth, as we mentioned earlier. And there will be opportunities for things like Retail Media in the future. So I think there are a number of ways in gross margin and also a number of ways in SG&A where we can continue to be more efficient to drive that investment. Our focus is always to drive, as I mentioned, the top line and if that, over time, allows us to continue to grow the margins, then obviously, that's something that we're pleased with, and it's a good outcome for our investors. But I wouldn't say, as you mentioned, it's a targeted outcome. It's really about making sure that we're driving that top line growth and the history, as you've mentioned, would suggest that when we've done that well as we continue to look for opportunities, it has allowed us to expand margin slightly as well.\nRon Vachris: I agree with Gary. I would add to that, there are several levers that our operators and our buyers have to improve margin. And our buyers speak often about the fact that we can lower prices while improving margin as well. And that comes with the efficiencies that we're seeing, comes with very good sell-throughs that we're realizing in the goods that we're buying, newness and bringing in new items to the market that that could have a little bit better margins. And our operating shrinkage has been improving. And we saw a nice solid year this year and picked up some margin on improving shrink results in the business as well. So those are some different levers that will augment lowering prices and continue to improve margins.\nKaren Short: But is it fair to think that 4%-ish maybe going up from there is realistic?\nRon Vachris: Yes, Kare, I think we wouldn't get into it, as you know, into sort of guidance of what we're expecting in the future. I do think, as Ron shared, that we don't see it as -- a if you like, a zero-sum game. I think we believe there's an opportunity to continue to find ways to invest in our members and our employees, and we do believe you can do that through the way that we manage the business to continue to improve profitability over time, but I wouldn't want to really provide any specific guidance related to that.\nKaren Short: Great. Thank you.\nRon Vachris: Thanks Karen.\nOperator: Laura Champine from Loop Capital. Your next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nGreg Melich: Hi, thanks. I want to go back to the profitability and gross margin, particularly gasoline, the tailwind. What -- are we now back at $0.20 of penny profit per gallon? Or what should we think of that as sort of a normalized range going forward?\nGary Millerchip: Yes. I think, Greg, we generally aren't sharing specific breakdown of profitability, and that would be true obviously across a number of areas of the business. But on gas, as I mentioned earlier, I would think of gas as being sort of fairly stable in general for us. There are peaks and troughs because of volatility in the market in the short-term sometimes. I wouldn't think of this quarter, while it showed up in -- as part of the overall improvement in other businesses, I wouldn't call it out as being like anything that was particularly changing the trajectory of gas or that would cause us to be wanting to share any more sort of detailed color because generally, we're expecting the gas side of the business to be relatively stable. As I mentioned, next quarter -- this quarter, I should say, that was an example of where there was some really very unusual volatility because of world events. But in the main, I would think of gas as not being a major sort of underlying change in trajectory or something to look at differently in our model. Obviously, we do provide color where there is something unusual that pops up, but I wouldn't think of that as being a directional change.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And given the recent wage increase, could you help level set us, so maybe on what your average wages are now in the US or globally? I think in the past, the number was something like $26 an hour?\nRon Vachris: No. Currently, the average wage is just north of $30 an hour.\nGreg Melich: Just north of 30%. Great. And that's for the US?\nRon Vachris: Yes. US and Canada [Equivalent] (ph) in Canada. Go ahead.\nGreg Melich: So my last question was just given the nonfood, the success there. You called out the gold bullion Boeing again. I'm just curious, are there any plans to maybe bring Kirkland Signature into the gold bullion market?\nRon Vachris: No plans at this time.\nGreg Melich: All right. Thanks a lot and good luck guys.\nRon Vachris: Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that's all the time we have for questions today. I will now turn the conference back over to Gary for closing comments.\nGary Millerchip: Thank you, Krista. Thank you all for joining the call today, and we look forward to talking to you at the next quarterly earnings call. That will conclude our call. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ron Vachris",
            "content": "Thank you, Gary, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As we turn the page on fiscal year 2024, let me make a few comments on our progress during the year as a whole. Throughout the fiscal year 2024, we will continue to execute on our strategy of growing the top-line through delivering the highest quality goods at the lowest possible price to our members. As a management team, we continue to be incredibly proud of our 333,000 employees worldwide and the culture that they foster. The consistency of our financial results is a reflection of the commitment of our entire team to member service and the Costco experience. Most of these employees are led by our fantastic warehouse managers, who we view as executives in our company. Succession planning continues to be a key focal point for us, as we're continually working on identifying the future leaders of our company. In fiscal year 2024, we promoted 95 new warehouse managers. 85% of those promoted, started at Costco as an hourly employee. This promote from within culture and the long-term career it helps to build is core to who we are as a company, community member, and retailer. A few other highlights I'd like to mention. In fiscal 2024, we hit our target of 30 new warehouse openings. This included one relocation and resulted in 29 net new buildings. Highlights included our first-ever building in Maine, bringing us to 47 states, and our 600th US Building in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. We also continue to see significant opportunities worldwide, and our fiscal 2025 plan has 12 of our planned 29 openings coming outside of the US, including our fifth building in Spain, which opened in Zaragoza two weeks ago. With three of these warehouses being relocations, we expect to add 26 net new buildings in fiscal 2025. We continue to grow our e-commerce business, and Costco Logistics has had a remarkable year. Appliances and furniture in big and bulky has led the way, and Logistics delivered over 4.5 million items this last year, up 29% over the year prior. Improvements in our items sortment, delivery times, and scheduling functionality all enhance the member experience. We have great momentum with this business and expect big and bulky items will be a key part of our continued progress with e-commerce in the coming year. Turning to technology, we're starting to realize the benefits from the work that was done this past year. Members are very excited about being able to check warehouse inventory via the Costco app. And the membership card scanners installed at the front doors have delivered on the goal of speeding up the checkout process. This has been very well received by our members. More improvements are currently underway, which should further benefit our business both online and in our warehouses. With that, I'll turn it back over to Gary to discuss the results for the quarter, and I'll jump back on during Q&A to field some questions. No, I have to agree with you, Gary. This is Ron. The purpose of the card readers at the front door, this is a system we've been using for over two years now in Europe and especially in the UK and we've piloted here in the US for about six months. Several different benefits for it. It gives our operators real-time traffic counts throughout the day. So we're able to adjust front-end lines that we need to open and close lines based on the fluctuations of business. We can monitor our fresh foods a little better because we know what the traffic counts look like and so forth. And it has also taken the friction of membership verification away from the front-end registers and move that to the front door, where we're able to look at people's membership status. We let them know if their renewals is due before they get to the front-end. So we've realized some very nice, healthy front-end improvements in productivity, and it's allowed our operators to manage the business much better throughout the day. Yes. This is Ron again. Yes, I'll take that question. The port strike is something we've been watching very closely for some time. We knew about the timing of this as well. When you think about the impact to our business, we import primarily nonfoods and some limited food and sundries come in, but nonfoods is less -- about 25% of our total business and only a subset of that is important. There's some domestic goods in there as well that are not imported in nonfoods. We have done a little bit of everything that you spoke about. We've got contingency plans, we've cleared the ports, we've pre-shipped. We've done several different things that we could to get holiday goods in, ahead of this time frame and looked at alternate plans that we could execute with moving goods to different ports and coming across the country if needed. It could be disruptive based on how impactful, I can't tell you until we know length and what could happen out there. But it is in our sights. Our buyers are all over it. They're watching it closely, and we've taken as many preemptive measures as we could to prepare for this. I'm not good at predicting the future, but I can tell you that from what we're seeing a big chunk of our freight comes in under contract. So we've been insulated from that. The spot market has peaked in the last quarter. We see that coming off now. If a port disruption could happen or something else could happen in the Red Sea, could that go up? Absolutely, it could go up. But from what we're seeing now, the spot market did increase is coming off at this point. And again, our team did a great job by insulating us with good solid contracts for this year. Yes. We have about 350 US warehouses rolled out at this point and through the process, reaction has been very positive. Myself, all our operators, and we really rely on feedback of our warehouse managers and what's been done. And our head operator, Russ Miller, and myself have been met with great positive reactions both from the members and from the operators as well. We have seen some lift in member sign-ups from that. We have also seen a lift in renewals because before people get to the front end, now they're aware that my renewal is going to be due when I get to the registers, so members are very appreciative about that. They know that and they get up to the front, and they're not shocked by that process as well. So improved productivity, improved interaction. And as we know, as our volumes grow, we're looking for everything we can find to use technology to help get our members through the front ends in a good, smooth manner. On the international to domestic new openings, it really is based on timing through the system. I mean, in larger markets, we may have a building that's taken us three years to get to fruition, where some markets move quite quickly. So there is no specific plan that we have. We put the buildings in queue. We agree that we're going to go there. And then it's following the process all the way through to how utilities come along, infrastructure, those types of things. As far as the outlook on international versus domestic growth, it's pretty balanced, again, more of a timing thing than anything. I think we've got 12 next year that will be outside of the US. And we've got some -- you could imagine in some countries, it takes us a few more years to get a building opened up. So it really is about the cadence of them opening. But we continue to look forward that we feel pretty good, balanced growth. We see infills as being very positive for us, both in US, Canada and all of North America that we have plenty of opportunities for infills in North America for the next several years ahead. And then a good market of new regions of the world. I don't think we have anything lined up for next year but new markets. I'd say that we're probably looking at 5 to 6 new markets that we'll be expanding into next year. I guess I'll take that one. We continue to see the penetration grow. And it's in the high 20s now as it continues to grow as our penetration across the board goes. We are not only seeing investment in price in Kirkland Signature. But with Claudine and her team, they have a commitment that if we're going to expect that of our suppliers, we're going to start with setting that example and showing the benefits of investing in price and driving unit volume. So we are doing that, but we are also seeing great support from our suppliers and our partners around the world. That are also interested in driving their business and using Costco as that partner to get that done. So we continue -- I think we've got some great items coming up this next year in Kirkland Signature that will continue to enhance that value proposition to our members and continues to build the loyalty with our members because this is a place you come to get Kirkland Signature. So we see good things coming. We see the penetration continue to grow, and we continue to see the value and the benefits to the members improving over time. Gary, if you would --. As far as the scanning, I really couldn't give you a number. I mean, we've been exclusive for -- since the inception of the company that we're exclusive to members. There are shop cards and those type of things that people come in with. But I really couldn't give you a set number of what percent of people coming in are non-members. And as far as inflation, I think Gary is signing, that he'd like to take that one. Yes. This is Ron. I don't see it as a concern. Gallons were up 3%, which was a little bit softer than the prior quarter. So when you do hit those peaks in prices, we will see a greater attraction to the Costco gas stations. But our balance of transactions, dual transactions that we have looks very positive. And so we're not seeing traffic dropping off at all in the warehouse based on the slightly softer gallon growth that we're seeing out in the gas stations. I agree with Gary. I would add to that, there are several levers that our operators and our buyers have to improve margin. And our buyers speak often about the fact that we can lower prices while improving margin as well. And that comes with the efficiencies that we're seeing, comes with very good sell-throughs that we're realizing in the goods that we're buying, newness and bringing in new items to the market that that could have a little bit better margins. And our operating shrinkage has been improving. And we saw a nice solid year this year and picked up some margin on improving shrink results in the business as well. So those are some different levers that will augment lowering prices and continue to improve margins. Yes, Kare, I think we wouldn't get into it, as you know, into sort of guidance of what we're expecting in the future. I do think, as Ron shared, that we don't see it as -- a if you like, a zero-sum game. I think we believe there's an opportunity to continue to find ways to invest in our members and our employees, and we do believe you can do that through the way that we manage the business to continue to improve profitability over time, but I wouldn't want to really provide any specific guidance related to that. Thanks Karen. No. Currently, the average wage is just north of $30 an hour. Yes. US and Canada [Equivalent] (ph) in Canada. Go ahead. No plans at this time. Thank you."

            "name": "Gary Millerchip",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Costco's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I'd like to start by reminding you that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. Comparable sales and comparable sales excluding impacts from changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange are intended as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP. Now before we dive into our financial results for the quarter, I'm delighted to say that Ron Vachris is joining us for the call today. I'll now hand over to Ron for some opening comments. Thanks, Ron. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the 16 weeks ended September 1st. As we did last quarter, we published a slide deck on our investor site, under Events and Presentations, with supplemental information to support today's press release. You might find it helpful to have this presentation in front of you as I walk through our results. Throughout this discussion, when we're comparing to last year's fourth quarter, the best way to normalize for the extra week is to multiply last year's results by [16-17] (ph). Net income for the 16-week fourth quarter came in at $2.354 billion, or $5.29 per diluted share, up from $2.16 billion and $4.86 per diluted share in the 17-week fourth quarter last year. This year's results included a non-recurring net tax benefit of $63 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, related to a transfer pricing settlement and true-ups of various tax reserves. Reported net income was up 9% year-over-year. Excluding this year's non-recurring tax benefit and normalized for the extra week, last year, net income and earnings per diluted share were up 12.7% and 12.6% respectively. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $78.2 billion, an increase of 1% from $77.4 billion in the fourth quarter last year. Adjusting for the extra week last year, net sales would have been up 7.3%. The following comparable sales reflect comparable locations year-over-year and 16 comparable retail weeks. US comp sales were up 5.3% or 6.3% excluding gas deflation. Canada comp sales were up 5.5% or 7.9% excluding gas deflation and FX. And other international comp sales were up 5.7% or 9.3% adjusted. This all led to total company comp sales of plus 5.4% or plus 6.9% adjusted for gas deflation and FX. Finally, e-commerce comp sales were up 18.9% or 19.5% adjusted for FX. In terms of Q4 comp sales metrics, foreign currencies relative to the US dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 0.9%, while gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 0.6%. Traffic or shopping frequency increased 6.4% worldwide and 5.6% in the US. Our average transaction, or ticket was negative 0.9% worldwide and negative 0.3% in the US. This includes the headwinds from gas deflation and FX. Adjusted for those items, ticket would have been positive 0.5% worldwide and positive 0.6% in the US. Moving down the income statement to membership fee income, we reported membership fee income of $1.512 billion, an increase of $3 million, or 0.2%, on one less week year-over-year. FX negatively impacted membership fee income by 0.9%. Excluding the impacts from the extra week last year, and FX normalized membership fee income was up 7.4%. In terms of renewal rates, at Q4 end, our US and Canada renewal rate was 92.9%, down one-tenth of a percent from Q3 end. This slight decrease related to an online membership promotion that we ran for a short period in fiscal year 2023, which resulted in over 200,000 new sign-ups. As those members entered the renewal rate calculation during Q4 fiscal year 2024, the lower renewal rates for that cohort, which is typical for digital promotions, had a negative impact on the overall US renewal rate. Outside of those sign ups, there were no meaningful changes in the US renewal rate. The worldwide rate came in at 90.5%, the same as Q3, with improvement internationally offsetting the slight negative in the US. We ended Q4 with 76.2 million paid household members, up 7.3% versus last year, and 136.8 million cardholders up 7% year-over-year. About half of new member signups in fiscal year 2024 were under 40 years of age. This percentage has been growing since COVID, and has lowered the average age of our member over the last few years. At Q4 end, we have 35.4 million paid executive memberships, up 9.6% versus last year. Executive members now represent 46.5% of paid members and 73.5% of worldwide sales. Turning to gross margin. Our reported rate in the fourth quarter was higher year-over-year by 40 basis points, coming in at 11% compared to 10.6% last year and up 33 basis points, excluding gas deflation. Core was lower by 5 basis points and lower by 11 basis points without gas deflation. In terms of core margins on their own sales, our core-on-core margins were higher by 9 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses' gross margin was higher 44 basis points and higher 42 basis points, excluding gas deflation. This increase year-over-year was driven by gas and e-commerce. E-commerce benefited from strong sales growth, item mix, and fulfillment productivity. And gas margins benefited from some moderate tailwinds and lapping a slightly weaker quarter last year, but nothing as significant as the benefit in Q1 2024, as a result of the volatility from world events in that quarter. 2% rewards was higher by 4 basis points or 3 basis points without gas deflation, reflecting higher sales penetration from our executive members. And LIFO was a benefit of 5 basis points. We had an $8 million LIFO credit in Q4 this year compared to a $30 million charge in Q4 last year. Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A rate in the fourth quarter was higher year-over-year by 8 basis points, coming in at 9.04% compared to last year's 8.96%. SG&A was higher by 2 basis points adjusted for gas deflation. The operations component of SG&A was higher 4 basis points, but was flat excluding gas deflation. Higher wages went into effect for the last six weeks of the quarter in the US and Canada, which was a headwind for the quarter of approximately 4 basis points. Investing in our employees remains a key part of our strategy, and we will continue to focus on driving top-line sales and improving productivity to mitigate the incremental costs. Central was higher by 3 basis points and 2 basis points without gas deflation. Stock compensation was flat year-over-year, and pre-opening was higher 1 basis point but flat without gas deflation. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $49 million versus $56 million last year, reflecting $1 billion of debt paydown in the second-week of Q4 this year. Interest income for the quarter was $138 million versus $201 million last year, primarily due to the $6.7 billion special dividend paid in January 2024. Interest income will continue to be a headwind in the first half of this year due to lower year-over-year cash balances and lower interest rates. FX and other was an $18 million loss this year versus a $37 million gain last year. This was primarily due to foreign exchange. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q4 was 24.4%, compared to 27.1% in Q4 last year. As mentioned earlier, this year's rate benefited from $63 million of net tax discrete items. Adjusted for this benefit, the tax rate for the quarter would have been 26.4%. Turning now to some key items of note in the quarter. We opened 14 new warehouses in the fourth quarter, 10 in the US, 2 in Japan, and 1 each in Korea and China. Capital expenditure in Q4 was approximately $1.58 billion, bringing the total year spent to $4.71 billion. Taking a deeper look into core merchandising sales, once again, non-foods led the way with the highest comparable sales in Q4. Our buyers have done a fantastic job finding new and exciting items at great values. Golden jewelry, gift cards, toys and seasonal, home furnishings, tires, and housewares all were up double digits in the quarter. Health and beauty aids also performed well, as we have expanded and elevated that category with new high-end SKUs, both online and in warehouse, including assorted luxury fragrances at a 30% to 70% value to retail. Across the fresh departments, we saw high single digit growth, as our continued focus on value is resonating with our members. An example of this in the meat department is our Kirkland Signature boneless chicken tenderloins, where we lowered the price 13% and saw a 21% lift in pounds sold. In food and sundries, the introduction of more international food products such as paneer cheese, Punjabi cookies, and fried tofu kimbap are resonating extremely well with our members. We're also delivering greater value by adding some new Kirkland Signature items, such as our KS Organic Golden Maple Syrup and KS aerosol whipped cream. Kirkland Signature offers significant member value compared to the national brands and continues to grow at a faster pace than our business as a whole. Our goal is always to be the first to lower prices where we see the opportunities to do so. And just a few examples this quarter include KS Standard Foil, reduced from $31.99 to $29.99, KS Macadamia Nuts, reduced from $18.99 to $13.99, KS Spanish Olive Oil, 3 liter, reduced from $38.99 to $34.99, and KS Baguette 2-Packs reduced from [$5.99 to $4.99] (ph). Our commitment to sustainability and achieving lower emissions is also presenting opportunities to lower our costs. A great example of this is our KS laundry packs, which we recently converted from a rigid plastic tub to a pouch. This allowed us to reduce the plastic packaging by 80% and pass these cost savings onto the member, lowering the price by $1 from $19.99 to $18.99. We've also found success working with suppliers to localize production of bulky items, such as water, paper, and laundry detergents. By manufacturing these goods closer to the countries in which they're sold, both costs and emissions associated with the shipment of these goods are greatly reduced. This quarter, we introduced our new Japan-produced Kirkland Signature paper towels. In addition to the emissions benefits from no longer shipping millions of units of paper towels from the US to Asia, the reduced freight allowed us to lower the price by approximately 30%, or $8 per unit in that market. As production ramps up, we are in the process of transitioning our other Asian markets to locally produce skews. Shifting the production country of this one product will result in annual member savings of $30 million. Within ancillary businesses, pharmacy have the strongest sales percentage increase, driven by double digit growth in script counts. Our optical department also performed well, as more members have taken advantage of the exceptional values in brand name frames and sunglasses. On a like-for-like 16-week basis, gas sales were negative low single digits in the quarter as a result of the average price per gallon being 5% lower. This was partially offset by gallon growth of 3%. Inflation was once again effectively flat in the quarter across all core merchandise. Food and sundries and fresh foods were slightly inflationary and this was offset by deflation in non-foods. In the supply chain, we are seeing good flow of products through Panama and Baltimore. The Red Sea is a remaining pain point and is causing some relatively minor shipping delays. Product availability has generally been good with a few exceptions. Egg supplies are still being negatively impacted by avian influenza and prime beef and a handful of vegetable SKUs have been tight. As Ron shared earlier, we are pleased with the momentum in our digital business and continue to make good progress with our technology priorities. Our app was downloaded 3.5 million times in the quarter, bringing total downloads to approximately 39 million, and we recently upgraded the native search function on our US mobile app, leading to a doubling of the click-through rate on search results. E-commerce traffic, conversion rates and average order value were all up year-over-year, helping to drive another strong quarter of comparable sales growth. While continued strength in bullion, was a meaningful tailwind to e-commerce comps, appliances, health and beauty aids, tires, toys, gift cards, hardware, housewares, home furnishings, optical and pharmacy all grew double digits year-over-year. The rollout of buy online and pickup in warehouse for TVs in the US market was also completed in Q4. This allows same-day pickup of a new TV for members who prefer not to wait for delivery. While buy online pickup in warehouse isn't cost effective for us on lower-priced items, for high-value items with high shipping costs like TVs, the freight savings more than offset the added labor, required in warehouses to fulfill those orders. We're now testing a similar program on laptops. Costco Next, our curated marketplace, while still small, continued to grow nicely in the quarter. We added 11 new vendors, bringing the total to 86 and adjusting for the extra week, gross sales grew nearly 40% year-over-year. A brief comment on the membership fee increase that went into effect on September 1. Due to deferred accounting, this will have minimal impact early in the year. The vast majority of the benefit will come in the back half of fiscal year 2025 and into fiscal year 2026. With that being said, our commitment to invest in our employees and members is continuous as evidenced by the July wage increase and lower prices such as the example shared on today's call. In closing, we are encouraged by our momentum exiting fiscal year 2024 and are excited about the growth opportunities ahead as we continue to execute our strategy of delivering exciting new items and greater value for members, innovating with Kirkland Signature and growing our warehouse footprint and digital capabilities globally. In terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, October the 6th on Wednesday, October 9th after market close. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now open the line up for Q&A. Hi, yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. As we think about our overall model for the company, our focus is on really achieving a balance across the business. And as you know, over the years, what we've done successfully at Costco is, continue to invest in members, continue to invest in lowering prices and value for our members and continuing to invest in our employees. And we believe that's going to be a critical part of our overall strategy going forward to make sure that we keep driving our top-line sales growth. You're absolutely right, during the quarter. And in fact, I think 3 times during the year, we shared -- we made various investments in our employees back in September 2023, we announced an increase in the starting wage. And then in March this year, we announced that we were increasing wages for a number of our managerial roles in the warehouses. And as you mentioned, we recently announced a further increase for all of our hourly employees in the warehouses and across our distribution network. And so from our perspective, we think that's an important part of continuing to support the top-line growth in the company. As you saw in the quarter, when you adjust SG&A for gas deflation and for looking particularly at the operational part of the business, the good news was we were able to effectively offset that cost -- those cost increases by driving productivity and driving sales leverage. And I think we've done that pretty consistently over time. And our expectation of ourselves is that we'll continue to do that. So I think for us, it's less about giving specific guidance on a particular measure but more looking over the long term of how we expect to be able to keep making those investments, but also driving leverage in our model to ensure we're sustainably driving top-line and driving profitable growth. Ron, anything you'd like to add? Sure. Yes, we called those two out because they were the two biggest factor in the results. I think of them as being relatively similar in terms of the impact. E-commerce actually has been a nice trend that we've seen for the last couple of quarters. We've been really pleased with the momentum in e-commerce. Of course, the headline sales growth has been very positive, which is a great starting point. But then the team's done a really nice job of improving fulfillment, efficiency and driving better sell-through in terms of the product and the inventory management as well. And the mix has improved. As I mentioned, on the prepared remarks, we've seen really good growth, really a balance across the board around e-commerce growth. So e-commerce has been a sort of a sustained trend that we've been pleased with the last couple of quarters. On the gas side of things, it was really -- I wouldn't say there was anything unusual during the quarter. It was really more a case that we had a little bit of tailwind in margin. And as I mentioned earlier, we're cycling some lighter margin in the same quarter in 2023. Sure. Yes, thanks for the question. We mentioned a couple of these things in the prepared comments, too, but we certainly think about as we increase the membership fee, our goal is always to find ways to deliver more value for the member. And we think about that pretty holistically. It can be lowering prices. It can be launching new Kirkland Signature products. It's also investing in ways that we can improve member experience and some of the things that Ron mentioned earlier. And we believe a critical part of delivering a better experience for our members is also in employee wages. So we very much look at it holistically and how do we make sure we feel confident that we are delivering more value to our members over time. And some of those things that you heard in Q4, we've already started that journey with some of the wage increases and some of the ways in which we've been able to lower prices and deliver more value through new Kirkland Signature products in the quarter. To answer maybe the broader question that you mentioned, as you know, we generally don't provide guidance as part of our updates for the results of the company. That being said, I would say, overall we feel very good about our momentum ending fiscal year '24. And as we head into the new fiscal year, we feel very good about the opportunity ahead of us. As always, we've set ourselves high internal expectations for how we expect to grow the top-line and to do so profitably. And we'll be doing that by continuing to invest in member value and employees while driving efficiencies and leverage. And we still see many opportunities to find ways to improve gross margin and SG&A in terms of opportunities to fund those investments. We wouldn't normally comment on cadence for the year ahead either. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there are a few unusual items this year with the deferred accounting for the membership fee increase, as you mentioned. And that will generally sort of really the most part of that will come in, in the second half of 2025 and the first half of 2026. And then there were also a couple of specific factors to Q1, namely the interest income, where we'll be cycling higher cash balances and higher interest rates from last year and gas profit, while it is really been pretty stable over the years, there was certainly some volatility due to world events in Q1 last year. So the one thing I think I would say is that as you think about our cadence of our earnings growth across '25, it's likely to be less linear than you would probably typically expect. Yes. Food and sundries were slightly negative. Fresh was slightly positive and non-food was the strongest of the three, which was really, again I think, from the mix perspective and the strong sell-through in the year, but that was sort of the breakout of it, John. Yes, maybe, Ron, just to add to the comment also, John, you were asking around the margin opportunity. Obviously, we stay very disciplined about -- we have a cap on the margin that we expect to make on a Kirkland Signature product. But as that mix continues to grow, it definitely creates some overall tailwind in our margin overall. And I mentioned a couple of examples in the prepared comments. We're also seeing some really great opportunities as we're thinking more globally across our merchandising team is really working together and finding ways to buy more efficiently and in-country production that we mentioned. So when you take all those combined, I think that's creating opportunity for us to win-win in the sense that we can create more value for the member, stick within our commitments around the margins that we work within, but I do think it creates tailwinds and ways to balance the investment in the member while continuing to grow long term. Yes, happy to. Probably similar to Ron's comment earlier, I don't know we would be particularly good at telling you what we forecast for the market overall, but what I can maybe give you some a little bit more color from what we're seeing, Scott from our perspective, we shared for the quarter overall inflation was essentially flat. We saw a little bit of inflation in fresh. That was mainly driven by produce right now. That was sort of the key category there that drove -- but again very low inflation, nothing meaningful to talk about. We're still seeing it very quiet in terms of the inflationary impact on prices and on the business. Food would have been slightly inflationary as well, but it's a remarkable actually how a small range now between the different categories, really nothing between positive 2% and negative 2% and sort of all coming back out to even just very slightly inflationary. But nothing much there either that we're seeing. We are seeing more of a mixed view on commodities. Things like corn and flower and sugar are all deflationary, which is causing the bakery category as a whole to be deflationary. But then on things like butter and cocoa and eggs, as I mentioned earlier on the call, and cheese, we're seeing more inflation. So I don't know that we're seeing anything today that's causing us to believe that where we are today is what the world looks like. And our goal, of course is always to find ways to lower our costs and therefore, hold prices down for our members. So I wouldn't say that we are seeing anything dramatically different from how our quarter looked for this quarter. But of course, like everybody we're susceptible to shocks and changes that can happen in the market. Yes. Thanks for the question. As you are familiar with the membership fee increase, we were very deliberate about the timing. In fact, we are really delayed by 2 years from when we've traditionally increased the fee every 5 years and that was initially because of what we thought our members were experiencing with COVID and then we saw higher inflation. So we were very deliberate in delaying the increase until we felt that we started to see inflation dissipate and our members were spending more in non-food categories seeing that they were coming through the inflationary period. From a member reaction perspective, I'd say, we haven't really heard a significant member reaction. Our membership renewal rates. There's no real change in trend, as I mentioned in some of my prepared remarks. I think the fact that we've been able to stave off inflation on things like the hot dog pricing at $1.50 and the rotisserie chicken at $4.99. And generally, demonstrating the way that we're lowering prices for members wherever we can. I think there's been a recognition that in the context of what's happened more broadly over the last seven years that we stayed true to our principles of really trying to help the member and deliver the value. And as we mentioned earlier on the call, we've been making investments, whether it be in wages for our employees in lowering cost to show our members that we want to make sure that the increase is delivering value to them. Sure. Thanks, Rupesh. I think we see the consumer or member through a course through our lens. And what I would say is that it is very clear that quality and value have never been more important. That's something that has very clearly coming through in our insights and how we're seeing our members shop. I think the encouraging thing for us is, as you know, as you look at our trends in the year-to-date, we have seen that as inflation has dissipated, our members have started to spend more on non-food items, which is really encouraging in our mind. And what we're really pleased about is the widespread nature of that across the different categories that we've seen in non-foods. I would say that on some categories like appliances and electronics, definitely, they've become more promotional over time. That would be a factor, I think, that members are looking for more deals. And for us, of course, we are always going to be there on price, but we also include within what we're offering to our members, the installation and the removal of the old product, if that's necessary in the delivery. So we kind of trend to try and differentiate there on the overall experience as well as being a great everyday low value. I think they're the kind of key trends in non-foods. On the food side of things, we've definitely seen some signals that would suggest that members and consumers in general are maybe shifting a little bit of spend from food away from home to food at home. Under the food and the sundry side of our business, alcohol would still be relatively soft. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're seeing really strong growth in our ethnic food categories and also in Kirkland Signature products, particularly in the new ones that we've been introducing. And then on the fresh side of things, really strong growth across meat, produce and bakery. I would say we've certainly seen a continued acceleration in some of those lower-cost protein items like poultry, cheaper cuts of beef like ground beef and pork. So there is definitely some signs that the consumer is being very choiceful in how they are spending their dollars. But thankfully, with the quality and value that we're offering is definitely resonating with our members. Yes. I think we still see it as a significant opportunity. It's definitely a journey for us. It's the foundations of that journey are getting our technology infrastructure in a position where we feel really good about the capabilities that will allow us to deliver to the member in terms of the offers that we can give to them and the level of targeting and personalized capabilities that creates. We've already started to build out those plans and starting to identify how we can capture low-hanging fruit where there are opportunities. But we would see it as a significant opportunity over the long term, to drive new revenue. We will approach this probably a little bit differently than many others \u2013 we'll be reinvesting the vast majority of those dollars as we always do to drive top line growth. And we think that will be a competitive advantage with our CPG partners because it will show them that every dollar they're spending is really intended to drive overall growth for the company. That being said, I do think it will help also with e-commerce business is typically less profitable, on this case, a way to offset some of those costs in delivery and fulfillment as well. Yes. Thanks, Kelly. As we look at the progress, we're really pleased with the momentum that we've seen in digital. Actually, we were looking at the data recently over a 10-year period, and we've grown our compounded annual growth rate in e-commerce, it's been over 20% for that 10-year period. So it's been a significant growth story for us and members clearly evaluating the additional ways in which we're giving them opportunities to find new deals and value for the member. Overall, it would be -- the penetration will be in the sort of high single-digit range based on how we report e-commerce today. If you kind of -- to your point earlier, we don't include some of those digitally started sales transactions, if I could say it that way. So Instacart, Uber, the ways in which members might be buying groceries and food and sundries. If you added those in, and of course, we also include gas in our total sales, we would be into the double-digit penetration when you include all those elements in the number. Yes. I would still say it's marginally, it's lower than the traditional shopping in the warehouse, and that's obviously intuitively makes sense given that we're doing more of the picking and shopping for the member. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we have seen some good improvements as we've grown our sales numbers, that's created some leverage in the model. We're improving the efficiency of our fulfillment costs. So it is continuing on an improving trend over time because of the sales growth and the leverage that's creating, but also some of the improvements the team are making in the business to drive more efficiency as well. Yes, thanks for the question. I think the key thing for us is we're our own biggest competitor. As you heard us mention earlier, we want to be the first to lower prices and the last to raise prices. And at every one of our regular budget meetings, we're talking about how can we find ways to do that. And the majority of our price investments are proactive, not that we're reacting. But of course, we're always watching and staying very close to competition. I would say that the promotional environment has been increasing. That would be with us, as Ron mentioned earlier, that our CPG partners are investing to find ways to drive units, and that would certainly be the case across some of the competition as well. I mentioned earlier, appliances and consumer electronics would be an area where we've seen more of that activity. But I think if you took it all on balance, we wouldn't say that we're seeing the activity sort of outside of normal in the food space. And we feel very good about our position relative to the market and continue to be proactive in finding ways to provide the best quality, best value for our members. Hi, Karen, I think the way we think about it is really back to some of the comments that we were referring to earlier is that our goal is always to drive top line. That's the top priority for the company, and we're focused on investing and delivering value for the member and delivering improved investments in our employees as well to make sure that we're an employer of choice. I think I appreciate the comment because I think, we have been successful over the years in doing that because there are ways for us to continue to lower our costs in our gross margin part of our business and drive more value for the member. Some of the things that we've been focused on, like global buying and the Kirkland Signature growth that we've seen, e-commerce growth, as we mentioned earlier. And there will be opportunities for things like Retail Media in the future. So I think there are a number of ways in gross margin and also a number of ways in SG&A where we can continue to be more efficient to drive that investment. Our focus is always to drive, as I mentioned, the top line and if that, over time, allows us to continue to grow the margins, then obviously, that's something that we're pleased with, and it's a good outcome for our investors. But I wouldn't say, as you mentioned, it's a targeted outcome. It's really about making sure that we're driving that top line growth and the history, as you've mentioned, would suggest that when we've done that well as we continue to look for opportunities, it has allowed us to expand margin slightly as well. Yes. I think, Greg, we generally aren't sharing specific breakdown of profitability, and that would be true obviously across a number of areas of the business. But on gas, as I mentioned earlier, I would think of gas as being sort of fairly stable in general for us. There are peaks and troughs because of volatility in the market in the short-term sometimes. I wouldn't think of this quarter, while it showed up in -- as part of the overall improvement in other businesses, I wouldn't call it out as being like anything that was particularly changing the trajectory of gas or that would cause us to be wanting to share any more sort of detailed color because generally, we're expecting the gas side of the business to be relatively stable. As I mentioned, next quarter -- this quarter, I should say, that was an example of where there was some really very unusual volatility because of world events. But in the main, I would think of gas as not being a major sort of underlying change in trajectory or something to look at differently in our model. Obviously, we do provide color where there is something unusual that pops up, but I wouldn't think of that as being a directional change. Thank you, Krista. Thank you all for joining the call today, and we look forward to talking to you at the next quarterly earnings call. That will conclude our call. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Costco Wholesale Corporation Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Gary Millerchip, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Gary, you may begin your conference.\nGary Millerchip: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. I'd like to start by saying how excited I am to be part of the Costco team, and it's a pleasure to be hosting my first Costco quarterly conference call. The whole Costco team has been incredibly welcoming. And as you might imagine, my first three months working alongside Richard have been a lot of fun. It's also been great visiting warehouses and facilities to immerse myself in the Costco culture and experience firsthand how this is positioning the company for continued growth. Over recent months, I've spent time and met with many analysts and investors, several of whom I know through my prior role. And it's clear you value and appreciate the company's current approach to investor communications. While I can't promise to be able to match the humor that Richard Galanti has become famous for, I can promise the same level of open dialogue and transparency you've come to expect. Oh, and to clear up some recent media speculation, I also want to confirm the $1.50 hot dog price is safe. Before I talk about our results, I wanted to mention that Ron Vachris is also join today's call. Many of you have expressed interest in hearing from Ron, and so we thought it would be a good idea to have Ron join the discussion and he can also take a few questions. Ron, would you like to add anything before we talk about the quarter?\nRon Vachris: Thank you, Gary. And again, welcome to Costco. I'm very happy to report that the transition from Richard to Gary has gone very well and we're very excited to have Gary on board as part of Costco, and I look forward to working together on the growth opportunities ahead for our company. Before we jump into the quarter, I want to make a couple of comments on the leadership transition. As Richard has mentioned on previous calls, I've worked closely with Craig Jelinek for many years, including side-by-side for the last two years as President. And so the current CEO transition has been very seamless process. Since January, my time has been focused on working closely with the teams around the world to ensure we continue to deliver the best quality merchandise that are best value for our members. I'm incredibly proud of our employees and I believe our consistency of the results is a reflection of their commitment to our members and to each other. Consistent with how Craig and Richard manage investor communications, I intend to have Gary host the quarterly conference calls and I will join as business permits to answer a few questions. So Gary, let's go to the results and I'm happy to jump back in for the Q&A portion to field some questions today.\nGary Millerchip: Thanks, Ron.

Reported net income for the third quarter came in at $1.68 billion or $3.78 per diluted share, up from $1.3 billion and $2.93 per diluted share in the third quarter last year. Last year's results included a non-recurring charge to merchandise costs of $298 million pre-tax or $0.50 per diluted share, primarily for the discontinuation of our charter shipping activities. Net sales for the third quarter were $57.39 billion, an increase of 9.1% from $52.6 billion in the third quarter last year. The following comparable sales reflect comparable locations year-over-year and comparable retail weeks. U.S. comp sales were 6.2% or 6% adjusted for gas inflation and FX. Canada was 7.7% or 7.4% adjusted. Other international was 7.7% or 8.5% adjusted, and this led to total company comp sales of 6.6% or 6.5% adjusted for gas inflation and FX. Finally, e-commerce comp sales were 20.7%, both on a reported basis and adjusted for foreign exchange. In terms of Q3 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 6.1% worldwide and 5.5% in the U.S. Our average transaction or ticket was up 0.5% worldwide and up 0.7% in the U.S. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 20 basis points, while gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 30 basis points. Moving down the income statement to membership fee income. We reported membership fee income of $1,123 million, an increase of $79 million or 7.6% year-over-year. Membership fee income growth was 8% excluding FX. In terms of renewal rates, at Q3 end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate was 93%, up one tenth of a percent from Q2 end. The worldwide rate came in at 90.5%, the same as Q2 end. We ended Q3 with 74.5 million paid household members, up 7.8% versus last year, and 133.9 million card holders, up 7.4% year-over-year. At Q3 end, we had 34.5 million paid executive memberships, an increase of 661,000 since Q2 end. Executive members now represent over 46% of paid members and 73.1% of worldwide sales. Our reported gross margin rate in the third quarter was higher year-over-year by 52 basis points, coming in at 10.84% compared to 10.32% last year and up 54 basis points excluding gas inflation. Core was flat and higher by 2 basis points without gas inflation. In terms of core margin on their own sales, our core-on-core margins were higher by 10 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses gross margin was lower 6 basis points and lower 5 basis points excluding gas inflation. This decrease year-over-year was driven by gas, partially offset by e-commerce. 2% reward was lower by 1 basis point, both with and without gas inflation with higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. LIFO was a benefit of 2 basis points. We had an $11 million LIFO credit in Q3 this year compared to no LIFO charge or credit in Q3 last year. This is the third LIFO credit this year following a $15 million LIFO credit in Q1 and a $14 million credit in Q2. And finally, other was higher 57 basis points or 56 basis points excluding gas inflation. This was all related to lapping last year's negative impact from the $298 million pre-tax charge for charter shipping activities. Moving on to SG&A. Our reported SG&A rate in the third quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 15 basis points, coming in this year at 8.96% compared to last year's 9.11%. SG&A was lower year-over-year by 12 basis points adjusted for gas inflation. The operations components of SG&A was lower by 14 basis points and lower by 12 basis points, excluding the impact from gas inflation, despite an increase in warehouse wages this year. Higher labor productivity and great cost discipline by our operators drove the improved core SG&A results for the quarter. Central was better by 1 basis point and flat with our gas inflation. And stock compensation and pre-opening were both flat year-over-year. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $41 million this year versus $36 million last year and interest income and other for the quarter was flat year-over-year as lower interest income was offset by a foreign exchange gain in the quarter. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q3 was 26.4% compared to 26.5% in Q3 last year. Overall, reported net income was up 29.1% year-over-year, and excluding last year's charge related to the discontinuation of charter shipping activities, it was up 10.3% year-over-year. A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, in the third quarter, we opened two new warehouses, both in the U.S. Additionally, since the end of Q3, we had two more openings. Last week, we opened in Loomis, California, and two days ago, we opened our seventh building in China in the Nanjing market. For the remainder of fiscal 2024, we plan to open another 12 new locations, nine in the U.S, two in Japan and one in Korea. This would bring the total for the full year to 30 openings, including one relocation for a net of 29 new warehouses. Regarding capital expenditures, Q3 spend was approximately $1.06 billion, and we estimate full year 2024 capital expenditure will be between $4.3 billion and $4.5 billion. Diving a bit deeper into some of the key themes we saw during the quarter. Non-foods have the highest comps of our core categories. This strength was aided by lapping some softness in sales a year ago, but was really driven by our merchandising teams doing a great job identifying high quality items with values that really resonated with our members and buying those items with conviction. As inflation has leveled off, our members are returning to purchasing more discretionary items. And growth in the category was led by toys, tires, lawn and garden and health and beauty aids. Bakery sales also showed great momentum in the quarter as our fresh foods team has reinvented that department with a number of new and exciting items, including the Kirkland Signature Lemon Blueberry loaf and Morning Buns. Within our ancillary businesses, the food court had the strongest quarterly sales with continued success of the chocolate chip cookie that was added to the food court this year. On the inflation front, it's more of the same from last quarter. Across all core merchandise, inflation was essentially flat in Q3, with fresh foods close to zero and slight inflation in food and sundries being offset by some deflation in non-foods. The deflation in non-foods was led by hardware, sporting goods and furniture, all still benefiting from lower freight costs year-over-year. Keep in mind that when we speak to inflation or in the case of non-food deflation, we're referring to our selling prices. We're intentionally creating incremental value for our members by delivering lower prices wherever possible. We believe our strategy of delivering value to drive unit volume and member satisfaction is the winning combination for us. In that vein, our buying teams are constantly aware of changing costs across all of their SKUs and are ensuring that we are capturing all cost decreases quickly so that we can pass on incremental value through price reductions. If we are unsuccessful in delivering ultimate value with branded goods, we evaluate the potential for new high quality Kirkland Signature items with a goal of providing at least 20% value versus what we would sell the national brand item at. This quarter, we released a new Kirkland Signature men's walking shoe and new Kirkland Signature facial wipes, both of which are doing very well. We also reduced prices on a number of existing items, including lowering Kirkland Signature pine nuts from $29.99 to $24.99 and reducing the price of our Kirkland Signature frozen shrimp SKUs by $1. These are just a couple of examples that came out of our recent monthly budget meetings where each country and region shares new and exciting items they have introduced to their warehouses and items where they've lowered prices. Turning now to digital. We continue to make enhancements to the app and website and are excited about the traction that these initiatives are getting with members. Total e-commerce sales growth in the quarter was led by Gold and Silver bullion, gift cards and appliances. In appliances, Costco logistics is playing a key role in providing both greater value and a better end-to-end experience for members. Deliveries through Costco logistics were up 28% in the quarter. Costco Next, our curated marketplace also continues to grow nicely and we added eight new vendors in Q3, bringing the total to 75. Our app downloads were up 32% versus a year ago with about 2.5 million new downloads in the quarter, bringing total downloads to more than 35 million. Site traffic was up 16% and average order value was up 8%. You may have also recently seen an announcement that we are expanding our relationship with Uber. Previously, Uber Eats delivered Costco orders in Texas and this new agreement allows consumers the ability to order from Costco through Uber Eats across all of Canada as well as 17 states in the U.S. We are also working to expand this partnership to several of our international countries in the coming months. In addition to the increased access to Uber Eats customers, the agreement will allow us to sell Uber gift cards globally and offer discounted Uber One annual membership to Costco members. Finally, in terms of our upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results for the four weeks ending Sunday, June 2nd, on Wednesday, June 5th, after market close. Also, remember that our fiscal fourth quarter ending September 1, 2024, will have 16 weeks versus the 17 weeks in the fiscal fourth quarter last year. And with that, we will now open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimeon Gutman: Good afternoon. Hey, Gary, how are you doing?\nGary Millerchip: Hi, Simeon.\nSimeon Gutman: We're going to take a stab at this membership question. The way that we've thought about it is it's an inflation offset to the model. And it was described as if you have enough levers in the middle of the P&L to deliver whatever stated EBIT growth you're trying to do, you didn't need to touch the membership fee. Is that still the way that you look at it? And is that visibility on enough levers still intact?\nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks, Simeon. And you're talking about a membership fee increase now. Is that where your question is coming from?\nSimeon Gutman: Right. Yeah. Yes.\nGary Millerchip: Yes. I would really kind of revert back to some of the comments that Richard shared previously. I don't think that we're thinking about it any differently than he's talked about in the last few calls. We've historically looked at increasing the membership fee every five years or so. And obviously, we're beyond that time period now in terms of what would be the typical cycle. There's nothing about anything that we see within how the business is performing that's changing our view on that. We feel really good about membership renewal rates. We feel really good about the test of are we delivering significantly more value to members than we were or have since we last increased the membership fee. But I think we are our own probably toughest competitor and that we look at what's happened in the marketplace over the last few years and when we were seeing high inflation and the risk and concern around recession. We -- as I know before I joined the company, it was talked about extensively and it continues to be talked about as it's something that is still a case of when we increase the fee rather than if we increase the fee. But we are still evaluating those considerations to determine what the right timing is. And when we reach that point where we feel it is the right time, of course, we'll be very open and direct in communicating that.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Fair enough. Can I ask about your opinion on the U.S. expansion, it's been holding in a lot better. It's been more giving than we would have thought several years ago. Do you have any thoughts just your own perspective, you're probably looking at members per warehouse. Are you surprised at the runway you still have in the U.S.? You think it could be even more than what we're aware of today less? Just curious if there's anything surprising on that item.\nGary Millerchip: I think it's only surprising in as much as I know we've talked previously about we thought that we would potentially run out of runway for new warehouses in the U.S. and as you know, this year we're opening close to 29 net new warehouses and many of those will be continuing in the U.S. and we still see significant runway to continue to opening more warehouses in the U.S. in the future. I think that sort of 25 to 30 new warehouse count is a reasonable proxy for what we think the runway is for the foreseeable future for new warehouses. And I'd be surprised if at least half of those weren't in the -- continue to be in the U.S. because we still see significant growth when we open those new warehouses. And what it's doing for us in fill in markets is it's creating capacity for our members that are shopping very busy warehouses today to be able to shop more frequently and drive more engagement with us and also it increases membership renewal rates over time as well. So I think we still see plenty of runway in the U.S. to continue to open more warehouses, but we also see a lot of growth opportunity, of course, in the international markets as well.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Thanks, Gary. Appreciate it.\nGary Millerchip: Thanks, Simeon.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking my question. There's been a lot of announcements from consumable retailers in recent times about making price investments. Do you think you need to make a sizable price investment in the next couple of quarters in order to remain competitive?\nRon Vachris: This is Ron Vachris. No, I think that this is part of our everyday DNA. I mean, we are competitive on a daily basis. Our buyers are on top of pricing daily, weekly and we all review them each month. And so we feel very good about where we are today and our runway to continue to be as competitive as we are moving forward.\nMichael Lasser: My follow-up question is, given some of the changes in leadership over the last year or so, is there any thought given to being more aggressive with some of the evolution on the model, things like buy online pickup in-store, deploying more technology in the store or capitalizing on the ever so great amounts of data that Costco has in the form of trying to monetize it through retail media. Thank you very much.\nRon Vachris: That's no -- and I think the answer to that is yes, on all those fronts. We are working on all those aspects. Right now, we're rolling out an expanded buy online pickup in warehouse that is always going to be limited in scope based on the volume in our warehouses that we have. We can't expand to all categories, but we're expanding as we currently speak in televisions and other electronic items that are there as -- and so yeah, we see that as a real opportunity for us. Technology is going to be one of our key priorities moving forward. How do we improve that member engagement and the relationship we have with them in our brick-and-mortar warehouses as well as online and through other aspects such as travel and so forth. So technology we see is a great opportunity to enhance the member relationship with Costco and also drive a lot more business for us as well as we move forward. So we're going to continually innovate. I mean, with the management changes, I wouldn't expect major changes as we have a proven strategy now. But as we've done for the past 41 years, we continue to innovate to the needs of our members. Oh, and the last on data, absolutely. We see a great opportunity for data. We have expanded our group there. We have a significant program now with retail media and we see some great upside potential. We've expanded that team and we see some good potential and some good runway for us in that as well, things like personalization and so forth.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you very much.\nGary Millerchip: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.\nChuck Grom: Hey, good afternoon and congrats again, Gary. And historically, Richard and team have been steadfast on the 14% to 15% margin ceiling, which has clearly paid dividends for the company over the years. I'm curious how you and Ron view this threshold you going to adhere to it? Do you think you can earn more? Just your thoughts on the margin front?\nRon Vachris: No, that 14%, 15% has been part of our life for many years. And so I think that's -- our objective, our buyer's goals is really how aggressive they can get on pricing and deliver the best value. So I don't see there's no plans to move that cap at all.\nGary Millerchip: And Chuck, maybe just one thing to build on that too. I think as you think about some of the opportunities that Ron mentioned on the earlier call, I completely echo Ron's comment about we have a really clear growth strategy that's obviously delivering momentum in the company today and these opportunities through technology and media, I think are great opportunities for us to find new ways to unlock value. But again, I think we see those very much in the mindset of how do we give 90%-ish of that back to the member, so that we're continuing to drive member engagement, member loyalty and member value.\nChuck Grom: Great. And then just to kind of build off Michael's question, just wanted to get your high level thoughts on digital e-com. What do you think Costco's strengths are? What do you think the weaknesses are today? And where do you think the biggest focus is going to be for the company in the coming years?\nRon Vachris: Our biggest strength on digital e-com is, of course, the merchandise and the value that we have. I mean that's what works for us in our brick-and-mortar. You know, the technology, the systems that we have, the teams have got a great roadmap of where they're going. A lot of the work that's being done right now is very foundational. So better fulfillment, quicker delivery times, the reliability of the site, those type of things. So those are the things. And then following that will come iterative changes of forward facing improvements that you'll see in the sites and move forward. So I think we've got a very good roadmap to do that. But I think that does -- it's -- I think personalization is a big deal for members that we could do a much better job on and also a better correlation of the warehouse and the online business. We're working towards warehouse inventory online. So members could use that in the app. But app functionality is one of our greatest opportunities.\nChuck Grom: Great. Thank you.\nGary Millerchip: Thanks, Chuck.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nScott Ciccarelli: Thanks, guys. Scott Ciccarelli. So given the strength of your discretionary sales following the well that we've seen with -- as the economy got a little funky, does that suggest your members are starting to feel better and more willing to spend on wants rather than needs?\nRon Vachris: Yes. It does indeed look that way. I've got to tell you that the discretionary spend we're seeing, I mean, we're definitely winning in consumables as we see the food business and dining away from home has softened up a bit and people are eating and we're seeing that in our fresh foods. But I have to tell you that categories such as the home division and toys are categories that have lagged quite a bit post-COVID that with great excitement, I mean, our buyers have come out and delivered some great items, have phenomenal values, have really rejuvenated those categories. And those are both leading categories for us in sporting goods, toys, furnishings, domestics, all those categories are really coming on very strong now and all of it discretionary in nature.\nScott Ciccarelli: Fascinating. And then today, we had a presentation. Obviously, Ron, you joined the call. Are there other changes we could potentially expect given some of the C-suite changes?\nRon Vachris: I mean, again, like I said, there's no major changes planned. The team is -- the team that's been running this company for some time. Gary has been a great addition to us and is contributing nicely. But our model is working. It's working around the world. Great value on quality merchandise seems to resonate in every region that we do business. So we'll continue to innovate. We'll continue to see new things and be relative to what our members needs are, but I can't sit here today and tell you to expect anything -- any great momentous changes in the near future. We just want to continue to actually execute well.\nGary Millerchip: And Scott, maybe just to add from my perspective of being new to the role and new to the company, early observations to me, obviously, the incredibly impressed with the culture and the strategy is clearly working very well. So my first priority is to really being new to the company is to really acclimatize and to support and enable a smooth transition with the culture to make sure the momentum that we have continues going forward. And I think the other point, as we talked about a little bit earlier on the call is we're on a journey with technology and data. And so hopefully, there's things that I can bring to work with the team and help us continuing on that journey and accelerate that journey. And really that's the priorities in my mind being new into the CFO role.\nScott Ciccarelli: Very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nRon Vachris: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKelly Bania: Thanks for taking our questions. And Ron and Gary, pleasure to have you both on the call and love the slides. Thank you. I wanted to just maybe go back a little bit to retail media strategy and personalization. I think, Ron, you noted a hire or maybe some key hires in that department. And Gary, I think you bring a unique perspective to this area or both of these areas. So I guess just can you help size up the opportunity for us on these two fronts in retail media and personalization? Is it at all different than a typical retailer because of Costco's unique model and SKU count or anything along those lines? And I guess, would that -- would your plans in these areas include any increase in technology spend in coming years?\nGary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Kelly. Yeah, I'll go first and then Ron may want to add some color as well. I think many of your comments are relevant to how we think about the opportunity. And from -- the first thing I guess I would say as being new and having joined the company is as you think about where a lot of companies talk about alternative profit streams, there are a lot of areas today where Costco is doing great things in that area today. So using the strength of the membership relationship in driving a very large co-brand payment program that delivers value to members and delivers values to the company. The travel services business that we have, which is pretty unique in retail, but I think in any other company would be viewed as a way of generating new revenue and alternative revenue streams from sort of expanding from that overall retail relationship. And then thirdly, I would say we have media revenue today in areas of the business. So it's not as though it isn't something that actually the business is delivering on today. But I think as Ron mentioned in an earlier comment that as technology and data are something that we're sort of building a path towards, I would still say there's significant opportunity for us to grow in that space because of the unique nature of the relationship we have with our members and the ways in which we can deliver value for them and tap into that data and tap into the growth that we're creating both in the warehouse and through digital channels. I think it's a little bit early to sort of size it in totality because you're right, there are also some unique elements about our model that would make our opportunity a little bit different. But from what we know today and from the team that's been brought in to help the company think through it, we certainly believe it's got significant runway to drive a lot of growth for the company. And as I mentioned earlier, though, I would definitely think of it as something that we'll look at to as we do with everything, reinvest in the member to really accelerate the growth of the company overall.\nRon Vachris: I would have to mirror what Gary says. We are -- we do have a unique model. We have a relationship with all of our members. Our responsibility is use that data wisely and respectfully. As far as IT spend, yeah, there will be some IT spend. We don't see as we look in the future, we don't see that to be anything that will really change our trajectory of our cap investments. But there will be some IT requirements, but we feel that will be in the normal course of business.\nKelly Bania: Thank you.\nRon Vachris: Thanks, Kelly.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nJohn Heinbockel: So guys, I want to go back to personalization again. Where do you think just conceptually the biggest opportunities are, right? When you think about wallet share, every one of your members is going to be a little different, but you can probably do cohorts. Why are they not buying from you and why personalized promotions, outreach on new items coming into the warehouse. I mean, where do you think the biggest opportunities are to build further wallet share?\nRon Vachris: John, I'll go ahead and start out. I think the biggest opportunity is, just like you said, the awareness of the warehouse and keeping our members in tune on what's active, what's going on in the warehouse near them and how we can continue to enhance and drive those sales. I think that that's probably our greatest opportunity with digital as we see moving forward. Personalization is good. We talk here a lot about a fair reasonable amount of personalization. We never want to compromise the treasure hunt of Costco. And that's equally as important as people that go to costco.com, never knew that they needed a 16 foot shed and they see a phenomenal value as they do in the warehouse. And so we don't want to personalize to a detriment, that changes our DNA and who we are. But we do know that there's definitely some improvements we could have that would enhance the member experience. And that's everything that our team is focused on is that how does this move to the member and how does it improve their experience with us digitally.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay. Maybe -- and then as a follow-up, Gary, you talked a little bit about the core-on-core. But maybe you step back a little bit if you -- and I know the idea is not necessarily to maximize margin, but maybe some thoughts core-on-core this quarter and I know I think there had been pressure on fresh, right, as you kind of normalize post-COVID back to a regular level. Are we now through that process of fresh getting back down to a certain level?\nGary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks, John. Just maybe to give you a little bit more color on the core-on-core and how it kind of played out during the quarter. And so if you think about the three main categories in core between foods and sundries, fresh and non-foods, fresh would have continued to have been slightly lower year-over-year, and that's a very deliberate strategy for us to make sure we're delivering more value for the member, and we think that's a really important place for us to drive member engagement and support, especially as we're still seeing some commodities that are a little bit inflationary right now. So that would have been very much part of the plan from our perspective. But it was more than offset, as you mentioned by the improvement in non-foods during the quarter, which was what led to the 10-basis point improvement on core-on-core. Food and sundries actually was pretty flat overall. So we feel good about the way that we're managing the balance while staying true to that principle of delivering the best value for the member. And we were pleased with how it played out during the quarter based on the work all the merchandising teams did.\nJohn Heinbockel: Thank you.\nGary Millerchip: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Please go ahead. Peter, if you're on mute.\nPeter Benedict: Sorry about that. Yeah. Sorry about that, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Ron, maybe one for you. Just kind of back to the member behavior, maybe back to Scott's question a little bit. Can you just talk about maybe just your observations around maybe income cohorts, any other ways you bucket or slice your membership base, just how the behaviors have evolved here over the last several months. Is there any change that you think is interesting to call out? You talked about the better general non-foods trends. Just curious if this environment reminds you of anything else historically? That's my first question.\nRon Vachris: Okay. It's a very healthy environment from what we see from our members right now. And as you take a category such as our meat department, which is growing very nicely. A lot of volume being driven in ground beef and our new everyday lower price on boneless skinless chicken breasts, really driving a lot of volume units there, while Wagu Beef and prime are growing at a great clip for us as well. So we're seeing that benefit from both sides of the consumer that great value in both areas are doing very well. The non-foods, I tell you that non-foods is strictly driven by newness and excitement and we see big and bulky going very well. It's been a year of our $1,200 swing set that we have on the floor. We can't get enough. They're just blowing out. But it's again that continuous innovation of merchandise that is exciting our members and really driving some sales force there. Executive membership continues to -- yeah, and that drives our executive base and because people are engaging at a much higher level.\nPeter Benedict: Sounds good across the board. But we're expecting a dryer to get delivered from Costco logistics on in the next couple of days. So looking forward to that. And then the second question would be, yeah, Ron or Gary, either one of you, just your view on vertical sourcing. I mean, this has been something that has been evolved in for several years going across different categories as you guys continue to grow your business, you need more, I guess, definable sources of supply. Just curious your view of vertical sourcing, where you are today, and what areas you might focus on over the next several years? Thank you.\nRon Vachris: Sure. We have -- we've gotten into vertical integration and sourcing as the need arises. And if you think back in the infamous story about the hot dog and coke at $1.50 and how are you going to figure out how to keep that price there, while we're going to open our own meat plants. And as we looked at the prices of optical lenses going up and then we opened up our optical grinding plants. So we did that to continue to look at those things. The chicken plant came because we saw an inflection point where supply was not going to meet demand. So we had to get involved and because we didn't have a partner that was willing to expand into that area as well. There is a focus that I have a group focused on too is that let's not try and be everything though. Let's -- we've got a business to run here and we're not going to get vertically integrated just because it's something we can do. It really is going to be driven by where the needs are and when do you need to step in. It's equally -- we have great partners out there that supply our goods for us and they're long-term suppliers. And so it's strategically using that relationship is going to be the key in the future. So there's nothing that I could announce at this time that we're going to expand into, but we continue to keep that in our back pocket should we need to.\nPeter Benedict: Terrific. Thanks so much.\nRon Vachris: You're welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Cheatham: Hey, everyone. This is Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. Thanks for taking our question. Recently, you were selling Instacart gift cards at a discount online and in warehouse and thought that was pretty interesting because it's potentially a gift card that could be used at a competitor as well. So I'm just curious, is there any strategy behind that? Are you trying to drive member engagement online and if there are any learnings from that initiative?\nRon Vachris: You know the strategy behind it was another avenue to bring value to our members is really what that was about is that there is an upcharge on having grocery delivered to home. We work closely with Instacart, now we will with Uber to try and keep those costs at a minimum, but they've got people to pay on their side as well. So the partnership was really to how do we continue to enhance that service for our members and drive more sales. And so that was truly the -- yes, somebody can go out and use that somewhere else. But again, our job is to save the members where we can and be it airline tickets or Uber Drive tickets or Instacart shopping, we look at all those opportunities to add value to the member.\nBrandon Cheatham: Got it. Thanks. And my follow-up, how do warehouses react when you open an infill warehouse? Does it open differently than other new markets? Does the current market feel an impact? And how many warehouses that you opened over the past year would you quantify as infill versus new markets? Thanks.\nRon Vachris: I guess how they react. We normally have good data before we'll open up an infill building and we can judge based on our member information what cannibalization will realize in what building. So we're able to get in front of that and adjust labor and payroll and buying and all those type of things for the upcoming cannibalization that we plan. And our team does a very good job. They're normally within a percent or so of what reality is to the execution of where our plans are as well. So we've gotten pretty good at planning those things out. And with -- it's strategic and the number of cannibalized locations I'd have to tell you, I'd have to say that we probably opened eight this year that cannibalized other buildings. Some may have cannibalized one warehouse, others may be in the middle and we had one in Toronto that cannibalized four buildings around it, but they've built back their sales within six months. So those are the opportunities where you know to Gary's earlier point, frequency improves significantly because members can get back into a high volume club. And so it's strategic cannibalization, if you would, as we look around the world.\nBrandon Cheatham: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nGreg Melich: Hi, thanks. Ron, I wanted to follow up on the gross margin cap still very much in place at 14%, 15%. Is there any reason that SG&A now that it's back under 9% of sales couldn't fall to 8% if you keep having the growth that you have?\nRon Vachris: No, that's a very fair -- that's a very good point. No, we continue to see -- I mean, the company, we had a very healthy SG&A number this quarter. Inventory was flowing very well. We had fresh goods coming through the system. Our warehouses did a phenomenal job. SKU counts are in line. And so it's one of those things where all the stars aligned and this is the way we operate well. When you can deliver that kind of a top-line growth at our size now, our operators do a tremendous job leveraging that to the SG&A. So what could that -- could that get to? I'd hate to say 8%, but I do think that we can have continued runway of driving down that number.\nGreg Melich: That's great to hear it. And on maybe some insight on gas gallons in the quarter. I know it was volatile and there's certainly a [indiscernible] pressure for a lot of members and consumers. Did that help the traffic acceleration in the quarter -- gas gallon growth?\nRon Vachris: Yes. We were 5% up in gallons, you know. And again, that's -- I think all those things when you can save people on gas, that's also going to lend to your traffic as well. But gallons were up 5% for the quarter.\nGreg Melich: A great number. And I think a follow-up on gas. Is that still -- is the profitability in gas, Gary, kind of similar versus a year ago or last quarter or is that trending up or down?\nGary Millerchip: Yes, the gas profitability would have been down a little bit. I think you may have heard me mention in the prepared comments that when we looked at the overall gross margin rate for the quarter and the sort of headwind that we had was in the ancillary businesses, the other businesses, and it was essentially gas that created that headwind. So we did see a reduction in gas profitability during the quarter, but overall, the core-on-core margin improvement and e-commerce improvement essentially offset that to bring us pretty close to flat overall when you adjust for gas inflation in the results. So it was down. I would say general, we've seen on gas profitability, it's been relatively consistent to slightly improving if you look over the last few years, but obviously, there are points in time when you think about volatility in fuel prices where you can have those ups or downs in any given quarter and that was -- this last quarter was one where we did see a headwind in year-over-year gas profitability.\nGreg Melich: That's fantastic. Well, welcome and I'll let somebody else ask about how much gold volume drove the comp. Take care, guys.\nRon Vachris: Thank you.\nGary Millerchip: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nRupesh Parikh: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So just going back to unit growth. In recent years, it's been stuck in that, let's call that mid 20s, it looks like this year will be closer to 30. Just want to get a sense of the opportunities to potentially accelerate that unit growth, especially in the U.S. just given some of your competitors are planning to accelerate growth from here.\nGary Millerchip: You know it is a good risk. When you look at -- I talked before about managed cannibalization and when you do these infills and 29 locations is a solid number for us. As you start getting into infills, some of these projects take a little longer. It's a little tougher than there's not a whole lot of greenland out there for us to go in and open up a warehouse. So we have to do some creative things to find a way to infill in a very high market. International expansion continues to be strong. Some of the countries or regions that we do business in take quite a bit longer to get things done. So I think you'll see that ebb and flow. That number 25 to 29 or 25 to 30 is a good number for us. We feel good with our staffing and leadership and building out the infrastructure behind these warehouses. So we open with great solid support there.\nRupesh Parikh: Great. And maybe just one follow-up question. So in terms -- you guys added Uber to a number of locations. So as you guys think about the intermediate to longer-term, would you expect multiple providers at all Costco U.S. stores over time? So maybe just more the rationale in terms of adding Uber and their longer-term vision?\nGary Millerchip: You know we saw -- we were testing Uber for some time in Texas. We had the tests going on there and we did see a new cohort of members engagement that are on the Uber platform. Uber also allowed us to expand our international footprint too. So we're going to be out in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, UK and that we'll be expanding and where we don't have grocery delivery now. So there were some real benefits to that relationship, along with the long standing Instacart relationship that we had has been very good for many years. So we think that it does open up a window for us for some new member engagement and we also think that it's going to be very good for us internationally and expansion there as well.\nRupesh Parikh: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horver with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nChristian Carlino: Hi, good afternoon. It's Christian Carlino on for Chris. Could you speak to some of the innovation you're seeing in non-foods and anything else you think is driving some of the performance, particularly in discretionary categories. You called out toys, sporting goods and homes. So maybe any incremental color you can provide on those in particular? And while you're clearly gaining share, when you compare your own performance to some of the syndicated data out there, does the emerging newness suggest there's also somewhat of a rising tide in some of these categories that saw some pull-forward over the pandemic? Thanks.\nRon Vachris: Well, yeah, I think if you look at -- if you talk about the home category and definitely is furnishings, which is one that was quite soft post-pandemic that has come back strong in furniture, those type of things. Then home decor, it's been some very unique items. I mean we've got 7 foot artificial trees that have come in and just exploded out and just blowing out of the warehouses and those are going at a nice clip. Domestics, the most unique items, Swedish dish towels, import items we're finding from around the world are doing very well. But it really comes down to unique items at great values that are exciting to members in all those categories. The housewares categories have been great. You know, sporting goods and toys, inflatable outdoor toys have been a big, big category for us as well. We've added the Kirkland Signature driver into our golf lineup that has -- that sells out as quick as it goes online. So we're seeing wins in several different categories.\nChristian Carlino: Got it. That's really helpful. And just broadly, are you seeing the competitive environment heat up in terms of peers investing in price, particularly in non-foods? You have some peers talking more and more about looking to drive units. Others are talking about a big step up in appliance promotions recently. So any color on what you're seeing competitively?\nRon Vachris: Yes. There'll be ebbs and flows with the competition, but I'm very confident that we are always in the right position and we're staying ahead of that to keep the value there for our members. So these are -- those things are cyclical, but we're going to be a value every day.\nGary Millerchip: And I think maybe just one thing to mention on that, Ron too, you mentioned it earlier, but with on the appliances, obviously, making sure we're always very competitive on price. But I do think the acquisition of Innoval Costco Logistics now and the value that we offer members there through both including the delivery and the insulation and the removal of the old appliance is proving to be a real differentiator for us on the member experience as well.\nRon Vachris: Absolutely.\nChristian Carlino: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Please go ahead.\nScott Mushkin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. And Gary, welcome. It's nice to be talking to you at Costco. And Ron, thanks for [indiscernible].\nGary Millerchip: Thanks, Scott.\nScott Mushkin: I appreciate it. So my first question is kind of the opposite what everyone asks all the time around the fee. But given some of the stuff you've outlined around media and maybe driving the SG&A down, why do you need to increase the fee, right? Your sales are strong, your fee income growth is strong. So what -- just because you've always done it doesn't mean you should do it. So what would be the rationale behind driving a fee increase at this point?\nGary Millerchip: You know fee increases go back to the members in lower prices. I mean that's -- it creates -- I mean and that's one of the key parts that we use that money for is that it allows us to broaden that distance from the competition and bring greater values than improving our operation overall for the member. So that's the primary focus.\nScott Mushkin: Okay. And then my next question actually is kind of dovetails on the last one. But you guys talked about the consumer being a little bit better overall. And I guess what I was wondering is, is that really a Costco phenomenon? In other words, are you gaining share and that's what's really driving your improvements in some of these categories like electronics and appliances and big ticket rather than the consumer actually getting better. Is there any way to tease that out?\nRon Vachris: I would say that that's very fair. We -- our merchants report monthly on industry trends in the country and/or internationally as we're seeing. And we can see our sales performance compared to the rest of market. And I would think that you're spot on when you say that we're gaining market share.\nGary Millerchip: Scott, maybe one thing I would just add to is, I think we're all reading a lot about the consumer, of course and what they're going through right now. And I think what we see is that value and quality has never been more important. And so that plays to, as Ron described earlier, what we deliver, and we're making sure that the teams are laser focused on every day delivering that value and quality. And so I think we're drawing customers to what Costco has offer for many years and it's never more relevant than now based on what we're hearing from members and consumers.\nScott Mushkin: Yes, we definitely like our Costco here at the Mushkin residence. So thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\nRon Vachris: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEdward Kelly: Hi, good afternoon, everyone.\nEdward Kelly: I wanted to ask you about maybe membership fee increase, but in a different way. And you just touched upon it a little bit about membership fee increase, right, just gets reinvested to your members. But can you talk a little bit more about how you think about the areas of reinvestment? I'm sure you probably have already done a lot of work around like where you would like that to go. Is there anything that's unique about where you know reinvestment might come to this time -- this time around just thoughts around that?\nRon Vachris: It moves as time moves and you see pricing in categories and where we have the greatest opportunity to be more competitive for our members. And it may be in an area that if fresh foods is seeing some price inflation, we may invest more in the fresh foods departments for that period of time. The nice part about our model with 3,600 SKUs, 3,700 SKUs is we're still quite nimble as big as we are. So we can shift and based on the needs of our members and where we think the best investment in margin would take care of them. We're able to shift that thought process and then move it around. So I wouldn't say that there's any set, okay, if membership fee goes up, it's going to be spent in these areas. We work as a team and we continue to monitor it throughout the year and we act as needed.\nEdward Kelly: Okay. And just a quick follow-up on club throughput. I mean, it's remarkable how you drive up to a Costco club and it's hard to find a place to park, but yet you guys can still comp the way that you do. How are you thinking about throughput and ways to improve that? And I don't know if both buy online and pickup is part of that. How do you think about things like scan and go or maybe it's club density? Just curious as to how you solve for that over time.\nRon Vachris: The part -- a good part of those is things like our e-commerce business and how we can -- how we can move out some of those goods out of the warehouse and move that business online. And as Gary spoke to, now that we have control over Costco logistics, we can bring great value to that experience as well. We continue to look at technology. We're testing some front door scanners that are going to -- they're speeding up our registers significantly when we get all the scanning and memberships are verified at the front door, it has shown a significant improvement in our register speed. And so that in turn turns over parking spaces much quicker. And so those kind of things along with strategic infills to help open up parking opportunities and gas expansions where those are needed as well. So there are several different levers that we'll continue to pull on how we can best serve the member in that building and where we need to make sure that we can look at throughput.\nEdward Kelly: Great. Thank you, guys.\nRon Vachris: You're welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nOliver Chen: Hi, Ron and Gary. You've done some really creative merchandising around UPTs and units per transaction with pickup items and innovation on that treasure hunt. What are your thoughts there? And also, big ticket and electronics, previously, previously, it was a bit of a drag. Just would love your thoughts on what you're seeing there. And third part is marketplace, the marketplace model and the concession model, and alternative inventory models. Just what are your views of opportunities there because they're really big ones and your member is so loyal to you as well. Thank you.\nRon Vachris: On your UPT, you were asking about the transaction impact?\nOliver Chen: I'm thinking strategically about adding units to people's baskets going forward and merchandising in that way as well if it's something you see in terms of an opportunity.\nRon Vachris: Absolutely. We -- that's one of the big -- we were just in a session with our grocery divisions and talking there. And we've seen a great success in international foods that have been brought in to the U.S. and then of the like from the U.S. into the other regions of the world where we do business. But you want to take care of not only the consumables in the grocery side, but when we bring in an item that's a success in Taiwan or Korea or the UK and it creates that excitement for the member, that's when we really have done a good job of triggering that impulsive purchase where members are trusting the buyers and they will add that additional item to their cart. So that's been a big win for us. And again, it goes a lot of times with that treasure hunt. I mean, you've heard the plays, people come in to spend $100 and walk out with $300. That's because our buyers do and our operators do a great job in making the warehouses exciting and keeping those on the forefront of what they're -- when they come in and do their basic shopping, they pick up a few additional items that just compel them at the time.\nGary Millerchip: I think maybe just to add on that, Ron too. I mean, the nice thing about the opportunity there for us is with trips up by 5%, that's really why the average basket size has been more flat recently and that's because we've been growing member engagement in consumables, as Ron mentioned, with food and fresh. And so it does present a great opportunity. And I think it also speaks to the team doing a good job of driving more frequency of member visits. So it creates a great opportunity for us to drive more of that basket size as well.\nRon Vachris: And then your question on marketplace is a significant opportunity for us moving forward. I mean, we really do indeed see that. I think especially with our limited SKU count in the warehouse, how can we expand the offering to the members, bring value to their membership card beyond what's within our four walls or what's on costco.com and we see this as a great growth driver for us in the future and a way to bring expanded value to the members as we look forward. So I'm quite bullish on Costco Next and what that can become in the future.\nGary Millerchip: I think the difference for us on that would be, of course, as we are with Costco Next is just being very curated for the member. So we're unlike a traditional marketplace that is about maybe just sheer volume for us, it's about making sure the member is getting something that truly is unique and valuable and being consistent to who we are, but it's tremendous upside opportunity there in that regard.\nOliver Chen: Okay. And finally, on that big ticket question, would love any green shoots on electronics or TVs? And the last question on Asia, you have same day in China and you've done a lot of great things in the Asian region. Just would love any update there in terms of progress you made and the big opportunity for more end sales as well. Thank you.\nGary Millerchip: Yes, I think just briefly on electronics, so we believe -- I think Ron referenced earlier, we look at a lot of the market data and we believe that we're winning with the member there in terms of the value that we're delivering and when we look at our trends versus the market. So we feel good about our ability to continue to outpace the market there and we're seeing a good opportunity within digital in particular to really drive more connection with the member and take some of those big ticket items from the warehouse to online as well. And in Asia, I think it would be consistent with what we've talked about with warehouses in the past that we think all of the markets offer us a great opportunity for growth. Some of those markets in Asia are more mature, but there's still significant opportunities to open new warehouses and fill in those markets. And then obviously, we have markets like China where we're really just sort of starting that journey, but there's tremendous growth opportunity as we identify the right path forward in that market.\nRon Vachris: So the grocery delivery in China, we're up and going on six buildings we all just opened our seventh warehouse this week. That will start up this weekend. It's been a big win for our members. Its delivery within two hours is what is able to be done. And so we're seeing some good incremental shops initially out of that program, and we look forward to good things in the future on that.\nOliver Chen: Thank you. Best regards.\nRon Vachris: Thank you.\nGary Millerchip: Thanks.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.\nJoe Feldman: Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking questions. A lot have been asked, but I do want to ask with Costco Logistics, what was driving that 28% increase, which is very strong? Was it new relationships with some of the other retailers or partnerships or just anything you could share on that would be helpful.\nRon Vachris: Yes, that is other -- that is only -- we only deliver Costco members' orders through Costco Logistics. There are no partnerships going through those numbers that you see. We do a trace amount of series numbers, but that's not in any of the numbers that we report the growth in. That is just part of the past relationship that's there as well. And it is appliances, furnishings and outdoor were the three big drivers. Appliances were almost 30% growth for us in the period. And again, to Gary's point, it's that member value of the all in, what you see is what you pay price for delivery, installation, haul-away, everything you need done at one time that has really resonated with our members and has been a great driver of sales force.\nGary Millerchip: Joe, I'll give you the practical example as a new entrant to the Seattle market. I just had Costco Logistics deliver two mattresses, three TVs and a couple of chairs as well for me. So that's the kind of stuff I think that we're seeing really resonate with members.\nJoe Feldman: Got it. That's great. That's great. Thanks, guys. And then just one other question. I know it's still relatively small, I think, but the Costco Next, is that sort of -- it seems like it's ramping nicely. I guess how will that continue to ramp in the future? Like where do you see that going and how important is that a driver? Like is that sort of the basis for this marketplace that Oliver was just asking about?\nRon Vachris: As Gary mentioned earlier, Costco Next is a bit unique, but is it a fully curated marketplace. As there's many other marketplaces out there that are just for somebody to go on and sell goods on this marketplace. These are relationships that our buyers have with our suppliers and we're creating new suppliers as well. This has not only been a new way to sell goods, we've also found that we can find some really neat items that are selling through Costco Next that we in turn then bring into our warehouse. So it is a great testing ground for newness -- new items, a way to expand categories of accessories for certain categories that you have swing sets that we sell online, but you have additional swings and slides and other activities that you sell that we normally wouldn't be able to fit into a warehouse. So it really complements the core warehouse business, but gives us an opportunity to expand member value to these other partners as well. So we see a lot of upside there.\nJoe Feldman: Got it. That's great. Thanks, guys. Good luck with the fourth quarter.\nGary Millerchip: Thank you.\nRon Vachris: Thank you.\nOperator: We have no further questions in our queue. And with that, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ron Vachris",
            "content": "Thank you, Gary. And again, welcome to Costco. I'm very happy to report that the transition from Richard to Gary has gone very well and we're very excited to have Gary on board as part of Costco, and I look forward to working together on the growth opportunities ahead for our company. Before we jump into the quarter, I want to make a couple of comments on the leadership transition. As Richard has mentioned on previous calls, I've worked closely with Craig Jelinek for many years, including side-by-side for the last two years as President. And so the current CEO transition has been very seamless process. Since January, my time has been focused on working closely with the teams around the world to ensure we continue to deliver the best quality merchandise that are best value for our members. I'm incredibly proud of our employees and I believe our consistency of the results is a reflection of their commitment to our members and to each other. Consistent with how Craig and Richard manage investor communications, I intend to have Gary host the quarterly conference calls and I will join as business permits to answer a few questions. So Gary, let's go to the results and I'm happy to jump back in for the Q&A portion to field some questions today. This is Ron Vachris. No, I think that this is part of our everyday DNA. I mean, we are competitive on a daily basis. Our buyers are on top of pricing daily, weekly and we all review them each month. And so we feel very good about where we are today and our runway to continue to be as competitive as we are moving forward. That's no -- and I think the answer to that is yes, on all those fronts. We are working on all those aspects. Right now, we're rolling out an expanded buy online pickup in warehouse that is always going to be limited in scope based on the volume in our warehouses that we have. We can't expand to all categories, but we're expanding as we currently speak in televisions and other electronic items that are there as -- and so yeah, we see that as a real opportunity for us. Technology is going to be one of our key priorities moving forward. How do we improve that member engagement and the relationship we have with them in our brick-and-mortar warehouses as well as online and through other aspects such as travel and so forth. So technology we see is a great opportunity to enhance the member relationship with Costco and also drive a lot more business for us as well as we move forward. So we're going to continually innovate. I mean, with the management changes, I wouldn't expect major changes as we have a proven strategy now. But as we've done for the past 41 years, we continue to innovate to the needs of our members. Oh, and the last on data, absolutely. We see a great opportunity for data. We have expanded our group there. We have a significant program now with retail media and we see some great upside potential. We've expanded that team and we see some good potential and some good runway for us in that as well, things like personalization and so forth. No, that 14%, 15% has been part of our life for many years. And so I think that's -- our objective, our buyer's goals is really how aggressive they can get on pricing and deliver the best value. So I don't see there's no plans to move that cap at all. Our biggest strength on digital e-com is, of course, the merchandise and the value that we have. I mean that's what works for us in our brick-and-mortar. You know, the technology, the systems that we have, the teams have got a great roadmap of where they're going. A lot of the work that's being done right now is very foundational. So better fulfillment, quicker delivery times, the reliability of the site, those type of things. So those are the things. And then following that will come iterative changes of forward facing improvements that you'll see in the sites and move forward. So I think we've got a very good roadmap to do that. But I think that does -- it's -- I think personalization is a big deal for members that we could do a much better job on and also a better correlation of the warehouse and the online business. We're working towards warehouse inventory online. So members could use that in the app. But app functionality is one of our greatest opportunities. Yes. It does indeed look that way. I've got to tell you that the discretionary spend we're seeing, I mean, we're definitely winning in consumables as we see the food business and dining away from home has softened up a bit and people are eating and we're seeing that in our fresh foods. But I have to tell you that categories such as the home division and toys are categories that have lagged quite a bit post-COVID that with great excitement, I mean, our buyers have come out and delivered some great items, have phenomenal values, have really rejuvenated those categories. And those are both leading categories for us in sporting goods, toys, furnishings, domestics, all those categories are really coming on very strong now and all of it discretionary in nature. I mean, again, like I said, there's no major changes planned. The team is -- the team that's been running this company for some time. Gary has been a great addition to us and is contributing nicely. But our model is working. It's working around the world. Great value on quality merchandise seems to resonate in every region that we do business. So we'll continue to innovate. We'll continue to see new things and be relative to what our members needs are, but I can't sit here today and tell you to expect anything -- any great momentous changes in the near future. We just want to continue to actually execute well. Thank you. I would have to mirror what Gary says. We are -- we do have a unique model. We have a relationship with all of our members. Our responsibility is use that data wisely and respectfully. As far as IT spend, yeah, there will be some IT spend. We don't see as we look in the future, we don't see that to be anything that will really change our trajectory of our cap investments. But there will be some IT requirements, but we feel that will be in the normal course of business. Thanks, Kelly. John, I'll go ahead and start out. I think the biggest opportunity is, just like you said, the awareness of the warehouse and keeping our members in tune on what's active, what's going on in the warehouse near them and how we can continue to enhance and drive those sales. I think that that's probably our greatest opportunity with digital as we see moving forward. Personalization is good. We talk here a lot about a fair reasonable amount of personalization. We never want to compromise the treasure hunt of Costco. And that's equally as important as people that go to costco.com, never knew that they needed a 16 foot shed and they see a phenomenal value as they do in the warehouse. And so we don't want to personalize to a detriment, that changes our DNA and who we are. But we do know that there's definitely some improvements we could have that would enhance the member experience. And that's everything that our team is focused on is that how does this move to the member and how does it improve their experience with us digitally. Okay. It's a very healthy environment from what we see from our members right now. And as you take a category such as our meat department, which is growing very nicely. A lot of volume being driven in ground beef and our new everyday lower price on boneless skinless chicken breasts, really driving a lot of volume units there, while Wagu Beef and prime are growing at a great clip for us as well. So we're seeing that benefit from both sides of the consumer that great value in both areas are doing very well. The non-foods, I tell you that non-foods is strictly driven by newness and excitement and we see big and bulky going very well. It's been a year of our $1,200 swing set that we have on the floor. We can't get enough. They're just blowing out. But it's again that continuous innovation of merchandise that is exciting our members and really driving some sales force there. Executive membership continues to -- yeah, and that drives our executive base and because people are engaging at a much higher level. Sure. We have -- we've gotten into vertical integration and sourcing as the need arises. And if you think back in the infamous story about the hot dog and coke at $1.50 and how are you going to figure out how to keep that price there, while we're going to open our own meat plants. And as we looked at the prices of optical lenses going up and then we opened up our optical grinding plants. So we did that to continue to look at those things. The chicken plant came because we saw an inflection point where supply was not going to meet demand. So we had to get involved and because we didn't have a partner that was willing to expand into that area as well. There is a focus that I have a group focused on too is that let's not try and be everything though. Let's -- we've got a business to run here and we're not going to get vertically integrated just because it's something we can do. It really is going to be driven by where the needs are and when do you need to step in. It's equally -- we have great partners out there that supply our goods for us and they're long-term suppliers. And so it's strategically using that relationship is going to be the key in the future. So there's nothing that I could announce at this time that we're going to expand into, but we continue to keep that in our back pocket should we need to. You're welcome. You know the strategy behind it was another avenue to bring value to our members is really what that was about is that there is an upcharge on having grocery delivered to home. We work closely with Instacart, now we will with Uber to try and keep those costs at a minimum, but they've got people to pay on their side as well. So the partnership was really to how do we continue to enhance that service for our members and drive more sales. And so that was truly the -- yes, somebody can go out and use that somewhere else. But again, our job is to save the members where we can and be it airline tickets or Uber Drive tickets or Instacart shopping, we look at all those opportunities to add value to the member. I guess how they react. We normally have good data before we'll open up an infill building and we can judge based on our member information what cannibalization will realize in what building. So we're able to get in front of that and adjust labor and payroll and buying and all those type of things for the upcoming cannibalization that we plan. And our team does a very good job. They're normally within a percent or so of what reality is to the execution of where our plans are as well. So we've gotten pretty good at planning those things out. And with -- it's strategic and the number of cannibalized locations I'd have to tell you, I'd have to say that we probably opened eight this year that cannibalized other buildings. Some may have cannibalized one warehouse, others may be in the middle and we had one in Toronto that cannibalized four buildings around it, but they've built back their sales within six months. So those are the opportunities where you know to Gary's earlier point, frequency improves significantly because members can get back into a high volume club. And so it's strategic cannibalization, if you would, as we look around the world. No, that's a very fair -- that's a very good point. No, we continue to see -- I mean, the company, we had a very healthy SG&A number this quarter. Inventory was flowing very well. We had fresh goods coming through the system. Our warehouses did a phenomenal job. SKU counts are in line. And so it's one of those things where all the stars aligned and this is the way we operate well. When you can deliver that kind of a top-line growth at our size now, our operators do a tremendous job leveraging that to the SG&A. So what could that -- could that get to? I'd hate to say 8%, but I do think that we can have continued runway of driving down that number. Yes. We were 5% up in gallons, you know. And again, that's -- I think all those things when you can save people on gas, that's also going to lend to your traffic as well. But gallons were up 5% for the quarter. Thank you. Well, yeah, I think if you look at -- if you talk about the home category and definitely is furnishings, which is one that was quite soft post-pandemic that has come back strong in furniture, those type of things. Then home decor, it's been some very unique items. I mean we've got 7 foot artificial trees that have come in and just exploded out and just blowing out of the warehouses and those are going at a nice clip. Domestics, the most unique items, Swedish dish towels, import items we're finding from around the world are doing very well. But it really comes down to unique items at great values that are exciting to members in all those categories. The housewares categories have been great. You know, sporting goods and toys, inflatable outdoor toys have been a big, big category for us as well. We've added the Kirkland Signature driver into our golf lineup that has -- that sells out as quick as it goes online. So we're seeing wins in several different categories. Yes. There'll be ebbs and flows with the competition, but I'm very confident that we are always in the right position and we're staying ahead of that to keep the value there for our members. So these are -- those things are cyclical, but we're going to be a value every day. Absolutely. I would say that that's very fair. We -- our merchants report monthly on industry trends in the country and/or internationally as we're seeing. And we can see our sales performance compared to the rest of market. And I would think that you're spot on when you say that we're gaining market share. Thanks, Scott. It moves as time moves and you see pricing in categories and where we have the greatest opportunity to be more competitive for our members. And it may be in an area that if fresh foods is seeing some price inflation, we may invest more in the fresh foods departments for that period of time. The nice part about our model with 3,600 SKUs, 3,700 SKUs is we're still quite nimble as big as we are. So we can shift and based on the needs of our members and where we think the best investment in margin would take care of them. We're able to shift that thought process and then move it around. So I wouldn't say that there's any set, okay, if membership fee goes up, it's going to be spent in these areas. We work as a team and we continue to monitor it throughout the year and we act as needed. The part -- a good part of those is things like our e-commerce business and how we can -- how we can move out some of those goods out of the warehouse and move that business online. And as Gary spoke to, now that we have control over Costco logistics, we can bring great value to that experience as well. We continue to look at technology. We're testing some front door scanners that are going to -- they're speeding up our registers significantly when we get all the scanning and memberships are verified at the front door, it has shown a significant improvement in our register speed. And so that in turn turns over parking spaces much quicker. And so those kind of things along with strategic infills to help open up parking opportunities and gas expansions where those are needed as well. So there are several different levers that we'll continue to pull on how we can best serve the member in that building and where we need to make sure that we can look at throughput. You're welcome. On your UPT, you were asking about the transaction impact? Absolutely. We -- that's one of the big -- we were just in a session with our grocery divisions and talking there. And we've seen a great success in international foods that have been brought in to the U.S. and then of the like from the U.S. into the other regions of the world where we do business. But you want to take care of not only the consumables in the grocery side, but when we bring in an item that's a success in Taiwan or Korea or the UK and it creates that excitement for the member, that's when we really have done a good job of triggering that impulsive purchase where members are trusting the buyers and they will add that additional item to their cart. So that's been a big win for us. And again, it goes a lot of times with that treasure hunt. I mean, you've heard the plays, people come in to spend $100 and walk out with $300. That's because our buyers do and our operators do a great job in making the warehouses exciting and keeping those on the forefront of what they're -- when they come in and do their basic shopping, they pick up a few additional items that just compel them at the time. And then your question on marketplace is a significant opportunity for us moving forward. I mean, we really do indeed see that. I think especially with our limited SKU count in the warehouse, how can we expand the offering to the members, bring value to their membership card beyond what's within our four walls or what's on costco.com and we see this as a great growth driver for us in the future and a way to bring expanded value to the members as we look forward. So I'm quite bullish on Costco Next and what that can become in the future. So the grocery delivery in China, we're up and going on six buildings we all just opened our seventh warehouse this week. That will start up this weekend. It's been a big win for our members. Its delivery within two hours is what is able to be done. And so we're seeing some good incremental shops initially out of that program, and we look forward to good things in the future on that. Thank you. Yes, that is other -- that is only -- we only deliver Costco members' orders through Costco Logistics. There are no partnerships going through those numbers that you see. We do a trace amount of series numbers, but that's not in any of the numbers that we report the growth in. That is just part of the past relationship that's there as well. And it is appliances, furnishings and outdoor were the three big drivers. Appliances were almost 30% growth for us in the period. And again, to Gary's point, it's that member value of the all in, what you see is what you pay price for delivery, installation, haul-away, everything you need done at one time that has really resonated with our members and has been a great driver of sales force. As Gary mentioned earlier, Costco Next is a bit unique, but is it a fully curated marketplace. As there's many other marketplaces out there that are just for somebody to go on and sell goods on this marketplace. These are relationships that our buyers have with our suppliers and we're creating new suppliers as well. This has not only been a new way to sell goods, we've also found that we can find some really neat items that are selling through Costco Next that we in turn then bring into our warehouse. So it is a great testing ground for newness -- new items, a way to expand categories of accessories for certain categories that you have swing sets that we sell online, but you have additional swings and slides and other activities that you sell that we normally wouldn't be able to fit into a warehouse. So it really complements the core warehouse business, but gives us an opportunity to expand member value to these other partners as well. So we see a lot of upside there. Thank you."

            "name": "Gary Millerchip",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. I'd like to start by saying how excited I am to be part of the Costco team, and it's a pleasure to be hosting my first Costco quarterly conference call. The whole Costco team has been incredibly welcoming. And as you might imagine, my first three months working alongside Richard have been a lot of fun. It's also been great visiting warehouses and facilities to immerse myself in the Costco culture and experience firsthand how this is positioning the company for continued growth. Over recent months, I've spent time and met with many analysts and investors, several of whom I know through my prior role. And it's clear you value and appreciate the company's current approach to investor communications. While I can't promise to be able to match the humor that Richard Galanti has become famous for, I can promise the same level of open dialogue and transparency you've come to expect. Oh, and to clear up some recent media speculation, I also want to confirm the $1.50 hot dog price is safe. Before I talk about our results, I wanted to mention that Ron Vachris is also join today's call. Many of you have expressed interest in hearing from Ron, and so we thought it would be a good idea to have Ron join the discussion and he can also take a few questions. Ron, would you like to add anything before we talk about the quarter? Thanks, Ron. I'll start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. Comparable sales and comparable sales excluding impacts from changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange are intended as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the 12 weeks ended May 12. Before I walk through all the numbers, new for this quarter, we are making available a slide presentation on our investor site under Events and Presentations. These slides summarize much of the information I will share today, including Richard's famous matrices. We intend to make this information available every quarter. Reported net income for the third quarter came in at $1.68 billion or $3.78 per diluted share, up from $1.3 billion and $2.93 per diluted share in the third quarter last year. Last year's results included a non-recurring charge to merchandise costs of $298 million pre-tax or $0.50 per diluted share, primarily for the discontinuation of our charter shipping activities. Net sales for the third quarter were $57.39 billion, an increase of 9.1% from $52.6 billion in the third quarter last year. The following comparable sales reflect comparable locations year-over-year and comparable retail weeks. U.S. comp sales were 6.2% or 6% adjusted for gas inflation and FX. Canada was 7.7% or 7.4% adjusted. Other international was 7.7% or 8.5% adjusted, and this led to total company comp sales of 6.6% or 6.5% adjusted for gas inflation and FX. Finally, e-commerce comp sales were 20.7%, both on a reported basis and adjusted for foreign exchange. In terms of Q3 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 6.1% worldwide and 5.5% in the U.S. Our average transaction or ticket was up 0.5% worldwide and up 0.7% in the U.S. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 20 basis points, while gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 30 basis points. Moving down the income statement to membership fee income. We reported membership fee income of $1,123 million, an increase of $79 million or 7.6% year-over-year. Membership fee income growth was 8% excluding FX. In terms of renewal rates, at Q3 end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate was 93%, up one tenth of a percent from Q2 end. The worldwide rate came in at 90.5%, the same as Q2 end. We ended Q3 with 74.5 million paid household members, up 7.8% versus last year, and 133.9 million card holders, up 7.4% year-over-year. At Q3 end, we had 34.5 million paid executive memberships, an increase of 661,000 since Q2 end. Executive members now represent over 46% of paid members and 73.1% of worldwide sales. Our reported gross margin rate in the third quarter was higher year-over-year by 52 basis points, coming in at 10.84% compared to 10.32% last year and up 54 basis points excluding gas inflation. Core was flat and higher by 2 basis points without gas inflation. In terms of core margin on their own sales, our core-on-core margins were higher by 10 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses gross margin was lower 6 basis points and lower 5 basis points excluding gas inflation. This decrease year-over-year was driven by gas, partially offset by e-commerce. 2% reward was lower by 1 basis point, both with and without gas inflation with higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. LIFO was a benefit of 2 basis points. We had an $11 million LIFO credit in Q3 this year compared to no LIFO charge or credit in Q3 last year. This is the third LIFO credit this year following a $15 million LIFO credit in Q1 and a $14 million credit in Q2. And finally, other was higher 57 basis points or 56 basis points excluding gas inflation. This was all related to lapping last year's negative impact from the $298 million pre-tax charge for charter shipping activities. Moving on to SG&A. Our reported SG&A rate in the third quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 15 basis points, coming in this year at 8.96% compared to last year's 9.11%. SG&A was lower year-over-year by 12 basis points adjusted for gas inflation. The operations components of SG&A was lower by 14 basis points and lower by 12 basis points, excluding the impact from gas inflation, despite an increase in warehouse wages this year. Higher labor productivity and great cost discipline by our operators drove the improved core SG&A results for the quarter. Central was better by 1 basis point and flat with our gas inflation. And stock compensation and pre-opening were both flat year-over-year. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $41 million this year versus $36 million last year and interest income and other for the quarter was flat year-over-year as lower interest income was offset by a foreign exchange gain in the quarter. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q3 was 26.4% compared to 26.5% in Q3 last year. Overall, reported net income was up 29.1% year-over-year, and excluding last year's charge related to the discontinuation of charter shipping activities, it was up 10.3% year-over-year. A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, in the third quarter, we opened two new warehouses, both in the U.S. Additionally, since the end of Q3, we had two more openings. Last week, we opened in Loomis, California, and two days ago, we opened our seventh building in China in the Nanjing market. For the remainder of fiscal 2024, we plan to open another 12 new locations, nine in the U.S, two in Japan and one in Korea. This would bring the total for the full year to 30 openings, including one relocation for a net of 29 new warehouses. Regarding capital expenditures, Q3 spend was approximately $1.06 billion, and we estimate full year 2024 capital expenditure will be between $4.3 billion and $4.5 billion. Diving a bit deeper into some of the key themes we saw during the quarter. Non-foods have the highest comps of our core categories. This strength was aided by lapping some softness in sales a year ago, but was really driven by our merchandising teams doing a great job identifying high quality items with values that really resonated with our members and buying those items with conviction. As inflation has leveled off, our members are returning to purchasing more discretionary items. And growth in the category was led by toys, tires, lawn and garden and health and beauty aids. Bakery sales also showed great momentum in the quarter as our fresh foods team has reinvented that department with a number of new and exciting items, including the Kirkland Signature Lemon Blueberry loaf and Morning Buns. Within our ancillary businesses, the food court had the strongest quarterly sales with continued success of the chocolate chip cookie that was added to the food court this year. On the inflation front, it's more of the same from last quarter. Across all core merchandise, inflation was essentially flat in Q3, with fresh foods close to zero and slight inflation in food and sundries being offset by some deflation in non-foods. The deflation in non-foods was led by hardware, sporting goods and furniture, all still benefiting from lower freight costs year-over-year. Keep in mind that when we speak to inflation or in the case of non-food deflation, we're referring to our selling prices. We're intentionally creating incremental value for our members by delivering lower prices wherever possible. We believe our strategy of delivering value to drive unit volume and member satisfaction is the winning combination for us. In that vein, our buying teams are constantly aware of changing costs across all of their SKUs and are ensuring that we are capturing all cost decreases quickly so that we can pass on incremental value through price reductions. If we are unsuccessful in delivering ultimate value with branded goods, we evaluate the potential for new high quality Kirkland Signature items with a goal of providing at least 20% value versus what we would sell the national brand item at. This quarter, we released a new Kirkland Signature men's walking shoe and new Kirkland Signature facial wipes, both of which are doing very well. We also reduced prices on a number of existing items, including lowering Kirkland Signature pine nuts from $29.99 to $24.99 and reducing the price of our Kirkland Signature frozen shrimp SKUs by $1. These are just a couple of examples that came out of our recent monthly budget meetings where each country and region shares new and exciting items they have introduced to their warehouses and items where they've lowered prices. Turning now to digital. We continue to make enhancements to the app and website and are excited about the traction that these initiatives are getting with members. Total e-commerce sales growth in the quarter was led by Gold and Silver bullion, gift cards and appliances. In appliances, Costco logistics is playing a key role in providing both greater value and a better end-to-end experience for members. Deliveries through Costco logistics were up 28% in the quarter. Costco Next, our curated marketplace also continues to grow nicely and we added eight new vendors in Q3, bringing the total to 75. Our app downloads were up 32% versus a year ago with about 2.5 million new downloads in the quarter, bringing total downloads to more than 35 million. Site traffic was up 16% and average order value was up 8%. You may have also recently seen an announcement that we are expanding our relationship with Uber. Previously, Uber Eats delivered Costco orders in Texas and this new agreement allows consumers the ability to order from Costco through Uber Eats across all of Canada as well as 17 states in the U.S. We are also working to expand this partnership to several of our international countries in the coming months. In addition to the increased access to Uber Eats customers, the agreement will allow us to sell Uber gift cards globally and offer discounted Uber One annual membership to Costco members. Finally, in terms of our upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results for the four weeks ending Sunday, June 2nd, on Wednesday, June 5th, after market close. Also, remember that our fiscal fourth quarter ending September 1, 2024, will have 16 weeks versus the 17 weeks in the fiscal fourth quarter last year. And with that, we will now open it up for Q&A. Hi, Simeon. Yes. Thanks, Simeon. And you're talking about a membership fee increase now. Is that where your question is coming from? Yes. I would really kind of revert back to some of the comments that Richard shared previously. I don't think that we're thinking about it any differently than he's talked about in the last few calls. We've historically looked at increasing the membership fee every five years or so. And obviously, we're beyond that time period now in terms of what would be the typical cycle. There's nothing about anything that we see within how the business is performing that's changing our view on that. We feel really good about membership renewal rates. We feel really good about the test of are we delivering significantly more value to members than we were or have since we last increased the membership fee. But I think we are our own probably toughest competitor and that we look at what's happened in the marketplace over the last few years and when we were seeing high inflation and the risk and concern around recession. We -- as I know before I joined the company, it was talked about extensively and it continues to be talked about as it's something that is still a case of when we increase the fee rather than if we increase the fee. But we are still evaluating those considerations to determine what the right timing is. And when we reach that point where we feel it is the right time, of course, we'll be very open and direct in communicating that. I think it's only surprising in as much as I know we've talked previously about we thought that we would potentially run out of runway for new warehouses in the U.S. and as you know, this year we're opening close to 29 net new warehouses and many of those will be continuing in the U.S. and we still see significant runway to continue to opening more warehouses in the U.S. in the future. I think that sort of 25 to 30 new warehouse count is a reasonable proxy for what we think the runway is for the foreseeable future for new warehouses. And I'd be surprised if at least half of those weren't in the -- continue to be in the U.S. because we still see significant growth when we open those new warehouses. And what it's doing for us in fill in markets is it's creating capacity for our members that are shopping very busy warehouses today to be able to shop more frequently and drive more engagement with us and also it increases membership renewal rates over time as well. So I think we still see plenty of runway in the U.S. to continue to open more warehouses, but we also see a lot of growth opportunity, of course, in the international markets as well. Thanks, Simeon. Thanks, Michael. And Chuck, maybe just one thing to build on that too. I think as you think about some of the opportunities that Ron mentioned on the earlier call, I completely echo Ron's comment about we have a really clear growth strategy that's obviously delivering momentum in the company today and these opportunities through technology and media, I think are great opportunities for us to find new ways to unlock value. But again, I think we see those very much in the mindset of how do we give 90%-ish of that back to the member, so that we're continuing to drive member engagement, member loyalty and member value. Thanks, Chuck. And Scott, maybe just to add from my perspective of being new to the role and new to the company, early observations to me, obviously, the incredibly impressed with the culture and the strategy is clearly working very well. So my first priority is to really being new to the company is to really acclimatize and to support and enable a smooth transition with the culture to make sure the momentum that we have continues going forward. And I think the other point, as we talked about a little bit earlier on the call is we're on a journey with technology and data. And so hopefully, there's things that I can bring to work with the team and help us continuing on that journey and accelerate that journey. And really that's the priorities in my mind being new into the CFO role. Sure. Thanks, Kelly. Yeah, I'll go first and then Ron may want to add some color as well. I think many of your comments are relevant to how we think about the opportunity. And from -- the first thing I guess I would say as being new and having joined the company is as you think about where a lot of companies talk about alternative profit streams, there are a lot of areas today where Costco is doing great things in that area today. So using the strength of the membership relationship in driving a very large co-brand payment program that delivers value to members and delivers values to the company. The travel services business that we have, which is pretty unique in retail, but I think in any other company would be viewed as a way of generating new revenue and alternative revenue streams from sort of expanding from that overall retail relationship. And then thirdly, I would say we have media revenue today in areas of the business. So it's not as though it isn't something that actually the business is delivering on today. But I think as Ron mentioned in an earlier comment that as technology and data are something that we're sort of building a path towards, I would still say there's significant opportunity for us to grow in that space because of the unique nature of the relationship we have with our members and the ways in which we can deliver value for them and tap into that data and tap into the growth that we're creating both in the warehouse and through digital channels. I think it's a little bit early to sort of size it in totality because you're right, there are also some unique elements about our model that would make our opportunity a little bit different. But from what we know today and from the team that's been brought in to help the company think through it, we certainly believe it's got significant runway to drive a lot of growth for the company. And as I mentioned earlier, though, I would definitely think of it as something that we'll look at to as we do with everything, reinvest in the member to really accelerate the growth of the company overall. Yes. Thanks, John. Just maybe to give you a little bit more color on the core-on-core and how it kind of played out during the quarter. And so if you think about the three main categories in core between foods and sundries, fresh and non-foods, fresh would have continued to have been slightly lower year-over-year, and that's a very deliberate strategy for us to make sure we're delivering more value for the member, and we think that's a really important place for us to drive member engagement and support, especially as we're still seeing some commodities that are a little bit inflationary right now. So that would have been very much part of the plan from our perspective. But it was more than offset, as you mentioned by the improvement in non-foods during the quarter, which was what led to the 10-basis point improvement on core-on-core. Food and sundries actually was pretty flat overall. So we feel good about the way that we're managing the balance while staying true to that principle of delivering the best value for the member. And we were pleased with how it played out during the quarter based on the work all the merchandising teams did. Thanks, John. Yes, the gas profitability would have been down a little bit. I think you may have heard me mention in the prepared comments that when we looked at the overall gross margin rate for the quarter and the sort of headwind that we had was in the ancillary businesses, the other businesses, and it was essentially gas that created that headwind. So we did see a reduction in gas profitability during the quarter, but overall, the core-on-core margin improvement and e-commerce improvement essentially offset that to bring us pretty close to flat overall when you adjust for gas inflation in the results. So it was down. I would say general, we've seen on gas profitability, it's been relatively consistent to slightly improving if you look over the last few years, but obviously, there are points in time when you think about volatility in fuel prices where you can have those ups or downs in any given quarter and that was -- this last quarter was one where we did see a headwind in year-over-year gas profitability. Thanks. You know it is a good risk. When you look at -- I talked before about managed cannibalization and when you do these infills and 29 locations is a solid number for us. As you start getting into infills, some of these projects take a little longer. It's a little tougher than there's not a whole lot of greenland out there for us to go in and open up a warehouse. So we have to do some creative things to find a way to infill in a very high market. International expansion continues to be strong. Some of the countries or regions that we do business in take quite a bit longer to get things done. So I think you'll see that ebb and flow. That number 25 to 29 or 25 to 30 is a good number for us. We feel good with our staffing and leadership and building out the infrastructure behind these warehouses. So we open with great solid support there. You know we saw -- we were testing Uber for some time in Texas. We had the tests going on there and we did see a new cohort of members engagement that are on the Uber platform. Uber also allowed us to expand our international footprint too. So we're going to be out in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, UK and that we'll be expanding and where we don't have grocery delivery now. So there were some real benefits to that relationship, along with the long standing Instacart relationship that we had has been very good for many years. So we think that it does open up a window for us for some new member engagement and we also think that it's going to be very good for us internationally and expansion there as well. And I think maybe just one thing to mention on that, Ron too, you mentioned it earlier, but with on the appliances, obviously, making sure we're always very competitive on price. But I do think the acquisition of Innoval Costco Logistics now and the value that we offer members there through both including the delivery and the insulation and the removal of the old appliance is proving to be a real differentiator for us on the member experience as well. Thanks, Scott. You know fee increases go back to the members in lower prices. I mean that's -- it creates -- I mean and that's one of the key parts that we use that money for is that it allows us to broaden that distance from the competition and bring greater values than improving our operation overall for the member. So that's the primary focus. Scott, maybe one thing I would just add to is, I think we're all reading a lot about the consumer, of course and what they're going through right now. And I think what we see is that value and quality has never been more important. And so that plays to, as Ron described earlier, what we deliver, and we're making sure that the teams are laser focused on every day delivering that value and quality. And so I think we're drawing customers to what Costco has offer for many years and it's never more relevant than now based on what we're hearing from members and consumers. I think maybe just to add on that, Ron too. I mean, the nice thing about the opportunity there for us is with trips up by 5%, that's really why the average basket size has been more flat recently and that's because we've been growing member engagement in consumables, as Ron mentioned, with food and fresh. And so it does present a great opportunity. And I think it also speaks to the team doing a good job of driving more frequency of member visits. So it creates a great opportunity for us to drive more of that basket size as well. I think the difference for us on that would be, of course, as we are with Costco Next is just being very curated for the member. So we're unlike a traditional marketplace that is about maybe just sheer volume for us, it's about making sure the member is getting something that truly is unique and valuable and being consistent to who we are, but it's tremendous upside opportunity there in that regard. Yes, I think just briefly on electronics, so we believe -- I think Ron referenced earlier, we look at a lot of the market data and we believe that we're winning with the member there in terms of the value that we're delivering and when we look at our trends versus the market. So we feel good about our ability to continue to outpace the market there and we're seeing a good opportunity within digital in particular to really drive more connection with the member and take some of those big ticket items from the warehouse to online as well. And in Asia, I think it would be consistent with what we've talked about with warehouses in the past that we think all of the markets offer us a great opportunity for growth. Some of those markets in Asia are more mature, but there's still significant opportunities to open new warehouses and fill in those markets. And then obviously, we have markets like China where we're really just sort of starting that journey, but there's tremendous growth opportunity as we identify the right path forward in that market. Thanks. Joe, I'll give you the practical example as a new entrant to the Seattle market. I just had Costco Logistics deliver two mattresses, three TVs and a couple of chairs as well for me. So that's the kind of stuff I think that we're seeing really resonate with members. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Costco Wholesale Corporation's Fiscal Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Richard Galanti, CFO. Please go ahead.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you, Debbie, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the Company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the Company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. Comparable sales and comparable sales excluding impacts from changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange are intended as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the 12 weeks ended February 18th, as well as February retail sales for the four weeks ended this past Sunday, March 3rd. Reported net income for the 12-week second quarter came in at $1.743 billion or $3.92 per diluted share, up from $1.466 billion or $3.30 per diluted share in the 12-week second quarter last year. This year's results included a tax benefit of $94 million or $0.21 per diluted share due to the deductibility of the $15 per share special dividend to the extent received by our employee 401(k) plan participants. Net sales for the second quarter was $57.33 billion, an increase of 5.7% from the $54.24 billion in the second quarter last year. Net sales were negatively impacted by approximately 1.5% in the US and worldwide from the shift of the fiscal calendar as a result of the 53-week 2023 fiscal year. The following comparable sales reflect comparable locations year-over-year and comparable retail weeks. For the -- in the US, we reported a 4.3% comparable. Excluding gas, deflation, and FX, the 4.3% would have been a 4.8%. Canada reported comp of -- for the quarter 9.2%, 9.0% ex-gas and FX. Other International 8.6%, and 8.2% ex-gas and FX. Total company 5.6% reported for the quarter, and a 5.8% excluding gas, deflation, and FX. E-commerce was an 18.4% reported, and an 18.2% excluding FX. In terms of second quarter comp sales metrics, our traffic or shopping frequency increased by 5.3% worldwide and 4.3% in the US. Foreign -- our average transaction or ticket was up three tenth of a percent worldwide and up one tenth of a percent in the US. And foreign currencies relative to the US dollar positively impact sales by approximately two tenth of a percent. While gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately four tenth of a percent minus. Moving down the income statement to membership fee income. We reported membership fee income of $1.111 billion, up $84 million or up 8.2% year-over-year in the quarter. In terms of renewal rates, at second quarter end, our US and Canada renewal rate came in at 92.9%, which is up one tenth of a percent from Q1 and 12 weeks earlier. And the worldwide rate came in also at 90.5%, similar to the last quarter. Membership growth continues. We ended the second quarter with 73.4 million paid household members, up 7.8% versus last year, and 132.0 million cardholders, up 7.3%, with continuing growth throughout the quarters. At Q2 end, we had 33.9 million paid executive members, an increase of 646,000 during the 12-week second quarter. Executive members represent a little over 46% of paid members and a little over 73% of worldwide sales. Moving down the income statement line, next, to the gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the second quarter was higher year-over-year by 8 basis points, coming in at 10.80% compared to 10.72% last year in the quarter, and at 4 basis points excluding gas deflation. Writing down the little matrix that we usually do with two columns, both reported and excluding gas deflation. First line item is core merchandise, plus 5% -- plus 5 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis, and plus 2 basis points ex-deflation -- gas deflation. Ancillary and other, plus 7 basis points and plus 6 basis points. 2% reward, minus 7 basis points and minus 7 basis points. LIFO, plus 3 basis points and plus 3 basis points. And all told, total reported, again, gross margin year-over-year up 8 basis points and up 4 basis points excluding gas deflation. In terms of the core margin on their own sales, again, while the number I just read you was a plus 5% -- plus 5 basis points and plus 2 basis points ex-gas deflation. In terms of core margin on their own sales, our core-on-core margins were up 25 basis points year-over-year, with food and sundries and non-foods being positive year-over-year and fresh being negative. Ancillary and other businesses, gross margins were higher by 7 basis points and higher by 6 basis points ex-gas. The increase year-over-year was driven largely by e-comm and partially offset by gas. 2% reward, again higher 7 basis points -- lower by 7 basis points both with and without gas deflation, with higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. LIFO, plus 3 basis points. We had a $14 million LIFO credit in the second quarter of this year compared to no LIFO charge or credit in the second quarter of last year. Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the second quarter was higher year-over-year by 3 basis points or minus 3 basis points would be higher, coming in at -- this year at 9.14% compared to last year's 9.11%. And the higher 0.3% would have been lower by 1 basis point excluding gas deflation. In terms of Q2 year-over-year, the operations component of SG&A, doing the matrix, was 11 basis points higher, or minus 11 basis points. Ex-gas deflation, minus 8 basis points, so 8 basis points higher. Central, plus 4 basis points and plus 5 basis points. Stock compensation, plus 4 basis points and plus 4 basis points. And total would be 3 basis points higher year-over-year and plus 1 basis point or 1 basis point lower year-over-year or better. And with regard to the operations component being higher by 11 basis points reported and 8 basis points excluding deflation. As compared to a year ago, since -- during the past year, we included two last March's extra top-of-scale increase in wages, which was about a 2 basis point hit to the SG&A line. As well, in the first quarter of this year we raised the starting wage in the US and Canada. We estimate the impact of that new wage also was a roughly 2 basis point. So, about 4 basis points of that 8 basis points or 4 basis points of that 11 basis points were related to those two wage increases, more than normal. Below the operating income line, Central I mentioned was better by 4 basis points or 5 basis points, and the rest was pretty much straightforward. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $41 million this year versus $34 million last year and interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $102 million year-over-year. This was driven by an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates and higher average cash balances, as well as FX which was favorable versus last year. We'll see less benefit from interest income going forward following the January payment of the $6.7 billion special dividend. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the second quarter came in at 22.1% compared to 26.1% in Q2 last year. As discussed earlier, this year's rate benefited from the tax deductibility of a special dividend paid to 401(k) participants. The fiscal 2024 effective tax rate including discrete items is currently projected to be in the 26% to 27% range. And excluding the special dividend tax benefit in Q2, our Q2 tax rate instead of being -- coming in at 22.1% would have been 26.3%. Overall, reported net income was up 18.9% in the quarter on a reported basis. And again, excluding the special dividend-related income tax benefit, it would have been up 12.5% year-over-year. A few other items of note. In terms of openings in the second quarter, we opened four net new warehouses, including three new locations in the US. Actually, two of them were Costco business centers, and one new Costco Wholesale warehouse, and one unit in -- our sixth in China in mid-January in Shenzhen. That's our six in China. There's been a lot of press about it. We have an estimated 10,000 people who were at opening and there are just under 200,000 members currently, including more than 20,000 members who signed-up from Hong Kong. And we've seen all kinds of things over there from tour agencies doing bus trips over to shop. For the full year 2024, we estimate 30 total openings, including two relo's, so for a net increase of 28 new units. And that puts the remainder of fiscal 2024 for Q3 and Q4, we plan on opening a total of 15 net new locations, 11 in the US, two in Japan, and one each in Korea and in China. Regarding CapEx, fiscal second quarter spend was approximately $1.03 billion. And for the year, it remains in the north of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion, in that range. One additional comment on China. This past Monday, we launched in our Pudong, China location, the ability for our members to order online about 400 items from our -- of our items to be delivered that day. This -- and the delivery will be within about an eight kilometer radius of the warehouse itself. That's getting a lot of social media attention over there and we plan to launch it in the other four Shanghai area locations by month-end, as well as in Shenzhen sometime the following month. In terms of e-commerce, e-commerce sales in Q2 ex-FX increased 18.2%. E-com showed strength in several areas, led by sales of gold and very recently silver. As well, appliances were very, very strong, as was gift cards and e-tickets. As well, Costco Logistics enjoyed record-breaking deliveries. Much of that -- many of those items are sold via e-commerce. In Q2 of 2024, we completed over 1 million deliveries, up 28% versus Q2 a year ago. In terms of e-commerce sales over the past few months, we believe we've done a much better job explaining to our members the significant value propositions we offer compared to traditional competitors in several big-ticket categories. Under the Why Buy At Costco banner and The Price You See Is The Price You Pay banner, we share with our members what's included in the price of appliances, tires, televisions, computers, and mattresses. You can see these online on our website of Why Buy At Costco. Just to give you one example. If you take a four-set of high-end tires compared to a traditional retailer, we include, of course, installation, rotation, balancing, a five-year road hazard warranty. Typically that's a lot less road hazard warranty than other places, or you'd have to pay for it extra, ongoing flat repairs, nitrogen, and disposal of the prior tires. So, just one of the examples where the price of the tires itself might be very close to us. When you put in all the differences of those additional items, it's anywhere from a 15% to 25% savings on any of these items. Next on my list, talk about costconext.com, a couple of comments on the seller platform. This allows -- costconext.com allows our members to exclusive asset -- access to direct-to-consumer sites for top-quality brands at Costco value pricing. Currently, there are about 70 -- there are 70 Costco Next brand sites, with 15 additional sites in development. We will likely end this calendar year with about 90 sites and continue to grow from there. Costco Next offers everything from home improvement to apparel to pet to home to kitchen to electronics to accessories, as well as sports, bicycles, and toys. You should check it out, it's a pretty good site. Progress continues to be made in our e-com, mobile, and digital efforts. A couple of recent enhancements. In February, we rolled out our new native mobile application homepage on iOS. The native homepage now loads in less than 2 seconds compared to 8 seconds previously. Needless to say, that's important when about 60% of our e-com business, both visitors and orders, are now done via our mobile app and browser. And last week, we rolled out Apple Pay to all members online, both web and mobile, on February 28th. App downloads during the quarter were up 2.8 million and currently total around 33 million. On the product side, a couple of other new items to comment on. In our food courts, we recently replaced the churro with an awesome freshly baked 5.5-ounce chocolate chip cookie for $2.49. It is awesome. It's a great-tasting -- and a great-tasting turkey sandwich for $6.99, with the rollout of the latter being completed this week. In addition, we recently opened our first fully operated sushi offering in Issaquah, Washington, across the street from our headquarters, with two more planned to open in the very near future. This operation is what we have successfully done for years -- for many years, and throughout our Asia Costcos and several countries over there. The sushi program has proven to be a category where we can be successful in both quality and price, and we're looking forward to seeing more of that in the future. A couple of comments about inflation. In the last quarter, in the first quarter, we estimated that year-over-year inflation was approximately zero to 1%. We'll now say that in Q2, it was essentially flat. And notwithstanding essentially flat, we're taking price reductions where we can. Anecdotally, everything from simple items like reading glasses from $18.99 to $16.99, the 48 count of Kirkland Signature batteries from $17.99 to $15.99, a 24 count of Pellegrino from $16.99 to $14.99, and even a four pounds of frozen three berry fruit blend from $14.99 down to $10.99 with new crop pricing. So, we continue to do that. We always want to be the first out there trying to lower prices. Many new items in sporting goods and lawn and garden are being set with lower prices year-over-year, and overall, mostly due to reduced freight costs and lower commodity costs versus a year ago. And overall, our inventories and SKUs are in good shape across all channels. Overall, we've had good seasonal sell-through during the quarter. In terms of shipping and supply chain issues, we've been asked about that often of late. There are some delays, generally just a couple to three weeks, but mostly now planned for. First, there was an issue a while back with the Panama Canal challenges. Then, of course, the Red Sea challenges. A lot of that has to do with changing the way ships are being routed. No meaningful pricing issues because a lot have been placed contracts. Finally, turning to our February sales results, the four weeks ended this past Sunday, March 3rd, compared to the same retail calendar weeks last year. As reported in our release, that sales for the month came in at $18.21 billion, an increase of 6.9%, versus $17.04 billion for the same four retail weeks last year. Again, just to announce what we did in the announcement earlier today, the US reported comp of 3.4% for February, ex-gas and FX, 4.1%. Canada, 8.4% and 8.3%. Other international, 10.8% and 11.3%. For our total Company, a 5.0% reported and a 5.6% ex-gas and FX, with e-com coming in at a 16.2% reported and a 16.0% ex-FX. Our comp traffic or frequency for February was up 6.2% worldwide and up 5.0% in the US. Foreign currencies year-over-year relative to the dollar negatively impacted total and comparable sales as follows: Canada by about one tenth of a percent negative; other international by approximately 0.5%; and total Company by approximately one tenth of a percent. Gasoline price deflation negatively impacted total reported comp sales by approximately 0.5%, and the average worldwide selling price per gallon of gas was down approximately 3.5% versus last year. Worldwide, the average transaction for February was down about 1.1%, which includes the negative impacts from FX and gas deflation. In terms of regional and merchandising categories, the general highlights are as follows: US regions with the strongest comps were Midwest, Southeast, and Northeast. In terms of other international in local currencies, we saw strength in Mexico, Australia, and Korea. Moving to merchandise highlights, food and sundries were positive in the mid-single-digits. Fresh foods were up high-single-digits, and non-foods were positive mid-single-digits. And ancillary businesses were up in the low-single-digits. Food court, pharmacy, and optical were top performers, with gas down low-single-digits on a lower price per gallon. In terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our March sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, April 7th on the following Wednesday, April 10th after market close. And lastly, before I turn it back to Demi for Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to say thank you to many of you who have turned in to each quarter, some for many years, to allow me to share with you Costco's results, both our ups and our downs, and thankfully many more ups than downs, and provide some fun and informative color on how we're doing along the way. Since going public in December of 1985, I have hosted all but one call and it's been an absolute privilege and honor to do so. So, thank you all. As you know, in early February, it was announced that I will be ceding the role of CFO to Gary Millerchip effective March 15th after our second quarter 10-Q is filed, and retire, including from our Board, next January. It's a bit surreal of late, but what a wonderful journey it has been with such a great Company and great people, including many of you on the call today. I have certainly been very fortunate. The good news, Gary joined Costco last week, and along with David and Josh, will continue to provide to you all with the transparency and straightforwardness that we are known for. It will be a positive and seamless transition. With that, I will be happy to turn it back to Demi to open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: The floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimeon Gutman: Hi, everyone. Hey, Richard, best wishes to you. Thank you for all your guidance. That's a metaphor since you don't give guidance. My first question is on the -- this is like a parting question on membership, and I want to make sure this framework sounds right. I know you said it's if, not when. And as part of the thought process is, there are enough levers in the business, product savings, cost savings, to be able to drive an appropriate level of profit growth from the business. And when that no longer presents itself, that's when the membership price increase can come through. And that can come through earlier than that, but that was one framework we were thinking in this, as we wait to hear when it happens.\nRichard Galanti: Sure. And by the way, it's when, not if, still. And but really, joking aside, we're not that smart in terms of figuring out exactly why. I mean we know that all the factors that we believe, if we wanted to do it, would we feel comfortable in terms of renewal rates, new member signups, loyalty, all those things are continuing in the right direction. It really is a function. And I don't think it would be done simply because, hey, things have slowed down a little bit, let's do it now. We like the fact that we're performing well. We like the fact that almost all metrics are going in the right direction in our business right now. We've got plenty of runway left. And given the economy and given everything else, it's us, it's Costco, so I think it is simply still not trying to be accede about it, it's not some big analytical formula, it's simply a measure of we will at some point, I'm sure, do it. And I've been joking with Gary, it'll be on his watch, not mine.\nSimeon Gutman: And then maybe one more, Richard, is another question. You used to -- the business has comped very consistently over time and you used to say, I regret when it won't comp north of 4% to 5% because that's where it may be tougher to leverage our expenses. If you think about that framework, does it still apply? And then as you hand the baton to Gary and even Ron, do you spend more or are there ways where you -- the cost structure of the business can actually be altered to lower that leveraged threshold point?\nRichard Galanti: Right. Well, I would say it's probably more likely to go up a little bit down just because of whatever goes on in life with inflation that happened. But I got to look back at the last few years. We were -- we and others were helped through the crisis of COVID. And we haven't given a lot of that back. If I look at our SG&A, I remember when in fiscal 2019, it came in at a $10.04 billion. I'm looking at these numbers here. And even in 2020, it was at a $10.30 billion in the first quarter before COVID. And then in fiscal 2021, it was at $9.65 billion and then down to an $8.88 billion. And now it's up to fiscal 2023, it was a $9.08 billion. So, notwithstanding that, I remember when it was slightly above $10 billion, we said, well, it's never going to get below $10 billion again. And a lot of factors continue to change. But just the sheer high productivity that we have is frankly higher than we thought. Some of that was gained through COVID because of everything else going on. But we haven't given it back. The good news is, we haven't given it back. And the good news continues to be that we seem to continue to be able to take market share. I think the fact that on big-ticket items, there's less SG&A. We continue to change the pack sizes of things for less freight, whatever it is. Although freight would be, that would be SG&A. But it is still a lot about sales at the end. And if you ask the rhetorical question, if comps went to zero, what would that mean? That would be tough on SG&A, but we'd figure other things out.\nSimeon Gutman: Yes. Okay. Best wishes. Thanks, Richard.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.\nChuck Grom: Hey, good afternoon. Richard, congrats on a great career, for someone who started on basically day one at the Company. My question is on culture. You've always said it was customers first, employees second, shareholders third, and that philosophy's clearly played out. So, looking at it, I'm curious how the new team is going to keep this culture intact and resist pressure from some of the non-founders of the Company going forward.\nRichard Galanti: Well, first of all, nothing has changed. It's not unlike the same question I think that was asked of Jim Senegal after 28 years before he retired, and before we knew who his successor was going to exactly be. And I remember the Board asking, if you're 100 in terms of extreme value and extreme taking care of the customer and the employee and everybody else, whoever takes your place, what will they be? And he paused for a minute and said, I have no doubt they'll be at least in the mid-90s if not higher. And frankly, after Craig was made that, in my view, whatever that number was, it increased towards a 100 just because that's what we do. That culture is so ingrained here. And we talk about changing management. I always joke when people ask me as CFO how I'm important -- am I important to the strategic whatever of the Company? The fact is, is we're run by merchants and operators, and we're there to serve and help them and certainly add our voice. But the fact of the matter is, and Craig for 12 years and now in Ron, you have people that have been here for 35, 40 years and were born and raised and have grown up in this culture. And it is so intact. Just last week when Gary joined us, he had to go through the required two-hour Costco orientation, which includes the obey the law, to take care of your customer, to take care of your employee, to respect your supplier. And then if you do that, you can reward the shareholder. It is -- that's the one thing I can sleep very well at night.\nChuck Grom: That's great. Thanks, Richard. Enjoy your retirement.\nRichard Galanti: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open.\nMichael Lasser: Good evening. Thank you so much for taking my question and best of luck, Richard. You mentioned previously that most of the metrics are moving in the right direction. Could you highlight which metrics are not moving in the right direction, especially from a membership per club standpoint? Are there any signs that some of the more mature locations are either reaching a saturation or starting to see a peak in that metric?\nRichard Galanti: No. First of all, when I said most, I was just trying to be human, that nobody is perfect. Everything is working in the right direction right now. And actually, I wasn't talking just about membership metrics, but in general, knock on wood, things are working pretty well. When I -- when we sit in at our monthly budget meeting, more times than not, we get pretty excited about what's going on from a new merchandising standpoint, newness, buying with conviction, and being aggressive and assertive out there. I mean, what we saw with just even that simple example I gave you with changes to big ticket items and why buy them at Costco, we saw great changes in numbers. So, we know that we've got a lot of levers to be able to pull to make this thing work. And so no, I just said, honestly, I said most because nobody is perfect. I didn't have any particular examples.\nMichael Lasser: Understood. My follow-up question is on what seems like an inflection in the discretionary business. To what degree is Costco experiencing improvement in the GenMerch categories as a result of aggressive changes, either like you had cited with the way you're communicating with the customer or the member, or aggressive actions to take down prices? And if you are pulling those levers hard, is there an opportunity to move even more aggressively to drive the discretionary business? Because it does seem like Costco is experiencing a rebound in some of these areas more so than the rest of retail. Thank you.\nRichard Galanti: Yes. And no, and absolutely. When -- what is it? It's called -- it used to be NPD, it's Circana, which is that industry that shows you how you are on different product -- non-food product categories versus the industry. When we look at something like appliances in the last several weeks or a couple of months, the industry is flat and we're up north of 20%. Same thing with tires, more than that percent. And so, now that you can't say, let's do everything and everything will be up 20% or 30% because that's not going to happen. But at the end of the day, the focus of the buyers, as an example, is coming up with new ways to do things, to have great pricing, and to constantly improve that pricing and figure out how to do that with our global buying power with -- every time there's a commodity price increase. Given an item business, we have buyers that are in charge of 20 and 30 items, if not less, not 200 and 300 items in a category. They know a lot more, in our view, about every cost component of that. And I think -- I feel very good that we do a very good job, and I'm not suggesting others don't, but I know we do a very good job of getting on the phone immediately and working those issues. And as soon as we can get a savings, we're out there first passing it on. And that's just our religion. Now, we're able to do that partly because our sales have been relatively strong, and we've lapped some things from last year that have helped.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Your line is open.\nPeter Benedict: Sure. Thanks for taking the question, and my congratulations as well. Well done. It's been a pleasure. Wondering if you can maybe talk about Kirkland, the penetration, what's going on there, any member shopping behavior around kind of private brand versus branded, and maybe what some of the branded packaged good companies are doing to maybe get some volumes up. Just curious about your view on that.\nRichard Galanti: There's not a lot of trade down, although when we -- we sometimes have more control over certain private labeled CPG items that we're able to drive more business, and so we're seeing an increased penetration of that versus some of the brands sometimes. But then that gets the brands to the table to work to provide more value on the branded as well. We want to be both. But we haven't really seen -- that was a question that happened as \"the economy was\" -- the question is, are we going into a recession, a couple of years ago, and inflation was peaking at 7%, 8%, and 9%, and are we seeing a difference? So, we did see a -- if you look back over the last 20 years, and without looking at the exact numbers, it seems like every year we'd grow a 0.25% to a 0.5% of increased Kirkland Signature penetration. And then there was one year when we were asked a couple of years ago, it seemed like there was 1% to -- 1.5% to 2% -- even 2% change in penetration. So, people were, in my view, switching a little bit out, but that's changed. We don't see that as much anymore.\nPeter Benedict: Got it. And then just on Costco Logistics, you gave some delivery numbers there. Just maybe step back a little bit. The penetration of Costco Logistics within the business, how meaningful is that at this point? What's left in terms of maybe growing that? Is that just going to go with the big ticket trends, or are there, I don't know, internal initiatives to kind of drive further penetration of Costco Logistics?\nRichard Galanti: What is done strategically, I hate to overuse that word, it's allowed us to be much better in value and delivery times and quality, and brought the delivery costs down on big ticket items, particularly appliances and big screen televisions, mattresses, and furniture, indoor and outdoor patio and mattress and patio furniture and indoor furniture, some sporting goods. And before we bought Innovel, we're now called Costco Logistics in the spring of 2020. And the year before that, in the US, we did about 2.2 million drops. And a drop is anything from dropping off a sofa to delivering and installing a new refrigerator, freezer, or washer, dryer, and taking the old one away for disposal. Both of those are a drop, recognizing their extreme difference there. But we did about 2.2 million drops in the US, none of which we did ourselves. With the acquisition of Innovel, I think for the - probably over the last -- with this million this quarter, a rough number of 4 million drops, which I believe about 70% of them -- over 4 million drops, and about 70% of them is us. We've reduced the delivery times. We've just introduced in some categories like two-hour windows where you can -- or three-hour windows where you can choose, two-hour windows where you can choose. So, we're constantly getting better, and we've greatly improved the value. And when you look at something, a category like appliances, we're still a very low percentage of the industry. And, the fact that it was up, 20%-plus last month or last quarter, is a function of some of the things we're doing in terms of shouting out how good of a deal it is and doing a better job of that. But we think we have an opportunity to continue to grow those categories, recognizing they're all meaningful categories, but they're all small percentages of our total. That's one of the nice things about us that we have lots of different categories.\nPeter Benedict: Got it. Great. Well, thanks again, and best of luck, Richard.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nRupesh Parikh: Good evening, and thanks for taking my question. And Richard, I also want to offer my congratulations on your retirement. So just going back to the core on core margins, they're up, I think, 25 basis points this quarter. Just curious what drove that strong performance, if there is anything in particular driving that?\nRichard Galanti: Well, on the non-food side, the biggest thing is -- well, not the big -- a piece of it is comparing to last year when we had extra markdowns. I think we probably talked about it last time that non-food was -- a year ago had been down year-over-year because of some of the supply chain challenges we had when such things were coming in late after the season in case some of the big ticket items from overseas containers. So, that was probably a chunk of it. On the Fresh food side, I said it was down year-over-year a little. Fresh is competitive, and we're being ever competitive on it as well. And -- but again, I don't view any of that as being terribly meaningful in terms of, is that a big change that is coming. There's always something that's up a little bit, and there's another thing that's down a little bit.\nRupesh Parikh: Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. On the expense side, you guys did have better expense controls this quarter. So, just curious to what changed sequentially, because the growth rate did decelerate by a few percentage points.\nRichard Galanti: I can't think off the top of my head other than I -- actually, someone across the table has just said the word focus. At our budget meetings, which happen every four weeks with 150-plus people in town from all over the world, those are the kind of things we look at. And I think the operators are doing a better job of budgeting. And one of the things I think that came out at the last budget meeting in terms of budgeting, if you budget sales a little higher and they came in a percentage -- a percent lower, you've got to your labor costs. And so a lot of it has to do with focus and being meaningful about it. We certainly don't try to control expenses by not doing a wage increase when we think we need to, and we certainly have done that.\nRupesh Parikh: Thank you. Best of luck.\nRichard Galanti: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Your line is open.\nScott Mushkin: Hey, thanks. Hey, Richard, I feel like we should be, like, raising your jersey to the Rafters like a superstar is retiring here. I never came without you, to tell you the truth. So, congratulations.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you.\nScott Mushkin: So, here you are. So, yes. So, we'll have to see that The CFO Hall of Fame. So, a couple of things, some of your comments that you made. You're doing this delivery in one hour in China. I think you started going from one club to three. Is that something you envision that can expand outside of China? And how should we think about that, maybe even vis-a-vis the US?\nRichard Galanti: Well, in a way, we're doing the same thing here with a few people, most notably Instacart. And a little bit was shipped down in the Southeast. And I think we've got a test in Texas with Uber. But at the end of the day, we had that same-day delivery already as function. Over there, it is a third-party that's doing it, like Instacart or these other ventures here. So, it's just -- it's new. It's not something that's new to the warehouse club industry in China. You could look elsewhere and find it too. But it's certainly something that makes sense. And again, in part because of social media, there's been a lot of publicity and just, I mean, from the day it launched three days ago, it's gone nuts in terms of how many page hits it's getting and all that stuff. But it's just part of the business.\nScott Mushkin: Got it. And then we've talked about this over the years, and I think you said you're going to do 28 net new clubs this year. What's the capacity of the organization? Where do you go? Do you envision that going to 35 and 40? Like, how should we think of it as we move out three to five years? Is it something that's going to trend up?\nRichard Galanti: I think, who knows, but I think generally it probably trends up a little. There was a few years there, excluding the year when COVID hit, that we only did like 13 because there were shutdowns in certain countries of construction and as well as the US. But if you look back, excluding that year over a three or five-year period, plus or minus a couple of years there, it was about 23 a unit. Without looking at numbers, about 23 units a year. At the time, you said, what do you see over the next 10 years? What we saw collectively was is somewhere in the, hopefully, targeting, let's say, 25 for the next five years per year, and then going up to 25 to somewhere in the high-20s, if not 30. I think that's generally the sense that we feel. Could we do more? Yes. Are we comfortable doing it this way? Yes. I think part of that is it's such a hands-on business. I get to say that from sitting here in headquarters most of the time, not traveling like my colleagues do in operations. But, Ron is a great example. I mean, he and several regional executives in operations, if there's an opening somewhere, or not an opening, they're out visiting, usually at least two, if not three weeks a month, or out for three or four days, jumping around, visiting locations, not only existing locations, but new sites. And so, I think from a standpoint -- and the other thing is, particularly in newer countries, you want to get the first one open so you can train 50 or 80 people that want to move to the next location in that city that'll help that one go. And we were very fortunate a few years back in the first Shanghai, in Minhang in China, where we had a number of employees from Taiwan that wanted to move and be promoted into new locations, new jobs over there. So, that helps us when we have one, then two, then four, then whatever. So we take it slow. All I know is, we're all very busy, and, particularly the operators and merchants as well. And so that's kind of the paradigm that I think that we're going to continue to work at. Something in the 25 range, and then heading up. Just a month -- just a quarter ago, I think our budget for this year was 32, and now -- or 31, now it's 28. And that's simply timing. There is two or three that are pushed, that for whatever, construction delays, or you found something in the soil delays, or whatever it might be, they might have moved from mid to late summer to early fall, which is the new fiscal year. So, I'm feeling pretty good that we're going to open 25-plus for the next couple of years, and then probably 28-plus, and go on from there.\nScott Mushkin: Perfect. Thanks, Richard.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nGregory Melich: Hi. Thanks, Richard. You mentioned the word surreal, the feeling of retiring. I'd say it's almost as surreal as a $4.99 chicken. So, thank you for all the help over the years. I would say, I guess two things I want to touch on. One is ticket pressure. It looks like just in the most recent sales, with traffic growing more and more, that you're seeing some AUR pressure. Is that 0% inflation turning to deflation, as the merchants are seeing into March and April?\nRichard Galanti: Well, I think that, again, the inflation number is a calculation based on costs and mix. I think it's probably -- I wouldn't look too closely if the average ticket was up a couple of -- a few tenths in the quarter, and then it was down a percent, down in February by a tenth. That's still relatively close. Some of it's a mix change, I'm sure, and some of it is -- some of the examples I gave you about lower pricing. Even if the underlying cost hasn't changed, some of it may be in terms of how we package, and we take advantage of that. So -- and that's on the sales side and not on -- not the exact cost from yesterday.\nGregory Melich: So, looking ahead, that number of flat looks pretty good from what the merchants are seeing today.\nRichard Galanti: Yes. I think when I go to the last budget meeting two weeks ago, I think there's -- in the presentations, there's a lot of -- I used the phrase a few minutes ago, upscaling. I didn't use that phrase, but then buying with conviction. I mean, I think the buyers are looking ahead right now in an offensive way and a positive way. Hopefully, we'll be right, but we feel so far we're being right.\nGregory Melich: I wanted to follow up with my second question on the Instacart side of e-commerce penetration. What would e-commerce penetration be now in the US if you included the Instacart delivery and the other deliveries?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. Instacart is 1.5% to 2% percent, something below 2%, but more to 1.5%, which is still on a $200 billion retailer, it's a lot. And we don't include that because that -- the Instacart person comes in, buys it, and checks out at the front end, so we don't include that. So, you'd add -- depending on rounding, you'd add 1% to 2% to the top-line number.\nGregory Melich: Got it. Well, thanks. Thanks for everything, and enjoy retirement.\nRichard Galanti: I hope to see you all.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. Your line is open.\nKelly Bania: Good evening. Thanks, Richard, and I have to add my congratulations to you. It's been a pleasure. Just wanted to ask where Costco stands with retail media and advertising dollars. I think the last update I had was in the range of a few hundred million. Just curious if you're willing to share with us where that stands today, what kind of growth that is experiencing, and just the Company's thought process on investing in that down the line.\nRichard Galanti: Well, without giving numbers out, we know there's an opportunity there more than we've done in the past. In the last six or eight months, we've brought on people that are seasoned in this business to help us, and it's a point of focus. We know that there's money out there. We've always been very successful in other forms of vendor buckets, whether it's end caps or advertising in our own Costco connection. And, of course, over the last several years, some advertising online or banners or placement, but there's a lot more that can be done there. Rest assured, whatever it is, we're going to use it to -- just like when we always said if we can save a dollar on buying something, we're going to give $0.80 or $0.90 to the customer. I think that mantra will continue on this side as well. So -- but there's certainly ability for more dollars out there. Some of our big retail competitors have talked about doubling in five or six years what they have. I think, again, it's a lower market share for us, so there's a little more opportunity for us to continue to grow that.\nKelly Bania: Thank you. And maybe just can I just follow up with the decision to roll out Apple Pay? Costco is pretty notorious for being strict on the payment method you can use. So just maybe the thought process on that, what you expect that to do for your e-commerce business, and any economics you can share.\nRichard Galanti: Yes, on e-commerce, there's not as many stored cards for our members. And as we're doing more with a digital wallet, that'll help as well. So, it's something that should help.\nKelly Bania: Fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nKaty Hallberg: Hi there, this is Katy on for Oliver. And, of course, best wishes to you in your retirement. Just wanted to talk a little bit about the Kirkland price gap versus national brands. I know you touched on the Kirkland brand a little bit earlier on the call. But how has that price gap changed, especially year-over-year? And how has there -- has there been any impact to unit elasticity given that price discrepancy? Thank you.\nRichard Galanti: Well, we definitely have seen an impact from it. I think historically, the view was it has to be at least as good, if not better quality than the leading national brand, and at least a 20% savings as compared to what we sell the national brand for. And those metrics continue in that regard. I think what we've seen when we look at some of the items that have risen greatly in price, like paper products, on a percentage basis over the last several years because of freight costs, because of pulp prices, because of energy, all those things have dramatically increased. And what used to be -- I don't know the exact numbers, but for an 18-pack of -- a 24-pack of toilet tissue or a 15-pack or 18-pack of paper towels, you've got price points in the high $20s, if not low-to-mid $30s. And where we can show a dramatic savings on that, we've seen dramatic changes in unit market share towards Costco -- towards Kirkland Signature. But that's something that's been an iterative process over many years, probably goes up and down a little bit. I'd say it's gone up a little bit in terms of a little more of a penetration in the last couple of years.\nKaty Hallberg: Great. Thank you. And then just to follow up on the store discussion and unit growth, can you just provide a little bit of color on how the international store openings are performing just from a productivity angle? How is that versus the more tenured stores as well as the domestic stores?\nRichard Galanti: I don't think there's a big difference. In new markets, it's always a little slower. So, like when we opened originally in Iceland or Sweden or Auckland or some of those or France several years ago, you're always going to start -- or frankly, Japan 20 years ago, you tend to start out lower. In some cases, it's also a question is, some local vendors may not want to -- local country vendors may not want to sell you because they want to upset all the big traditional that have all the market share before we enter. And once we get two or three open, they talk to you a little more. And so I think all those things help us as we grow. Certainly, it's changed a little bit in the last few years. China being the most recent example, when we opened the first one in Minhang in Shanghai, what, about four years ago? It made international news based on just the sheer number of members we signed up and everything. So we have a lot faster start, I think. Each year, we have a lot faster start than the year before. And so I don't see a big difference there. We certainly -- if you look in the US, I mean, I think one thing that's interesting is this fiscal year, we're going to open, whatever, 28 units. Let me get my page here. And, I think of the 28, 20-plus are in the US, which is -- some people have asked, has it slowed down internationally? No, international takes a little longer to do. But what's interesting is, is we have a lot more runway than we ever thought possible. If you had asked us five years ago, by now, how many would we be putting in this year in the US? We would not have said 20-plus. It's got to slow down at some point. But the volumes that we're now doing in these locations, we've got to bleed some of that off. And so that's one good point. And then we've still got plenty going on overseas. And you'll see that continue to ramp up as well.\nKaty Hallberg: Excellent. Thank you so much, and best wishes again.\nRichard Galanti: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Your line is open.\nScot Ciccarelli: Thanks for the time, guys. It seems like you guys are doing some things to cut down on membership sharing, food court usage from nonmembers, etc. Richard, are you seeing something in the business that gives you concern that there's a growing issue from things like membership sharing?\nRichard Galanti: No, I think part of it is -- first of all, I think the storyline sometimes is a little greater than the reality. During COVID, we did a little bit more. There was a little bit more membership sharing. You had individuals where one family member, maybe not the one that had one of the two memberships, was coming into shop with mom or dad's credit card. And we allowed it. And then with the advent of self-checkout over the last several years, when you walk in the front door and you just flash your card and do they look at it or not, who knows, you would -- people would get in. And if you're going through self-checkout, you're not having to show your membership card to the cashier. And so there's probably an increasing but still small level of abuse of that privilege. And -- but we also had complaints from members saying, I pay, why shouldn't they? So, the view was -- is we needed to just shore that up a little bit. And we did. We did it over a period of six months, I think about six months, where we -- first there was warnings, and then ultimately changed. Are we getting some new signups from it? Absolutely. But it's relative to the 60 million or 70 million members, it's not terribly meaningful. But it's more fair and the right thing to do.\nScot Ciccarelli: Yes, I mean, that was actually -- you started to answer it. So, like you've seen some acceleration in membership. Should we kind of expect to see that in the future, like what we've seen with Netflix, for example, as they cut down on their sharing?\nRichard Galanti: Right. Well, it seems like Netflix had a much bigger issue or the ability to share was much easier because, first of all, it's electronic. In this sense, you still have to show a card when you walked in. And we're actually doing testing on that too, in terms of having your card be scanned and reviewed when you walk in. And we've done that in the UK, I believe, for a few years. And so it's all about -- just I would say it's as much hygiene as anything else. And it'll be slightly profitable to the extent that we make sure everybody -- I think we signed up more members than there were non-members then lost the small sales that that non-member did.\nScot Ciccarelli: Makes sense. Thanks again. And enjoy the next stage.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nJohn Heinbockel: Congratulations, Richard. Enjoy your retirement. You'll be missed. So, when you think about -- you don't have many pain points in your in your clubs. But when you think about kind of throughput and things like, I know you tested BOPUS and cost really didn't make sense there. Things like that and/or scan and go, what -- do you think there are some unlocks here to do more volume and/or reduce any pain points?\nRichard Galanti: I think the biggest challenge with pain points, first of all, is full of merchandise and pallets through the system, which we continue to work on and improve. Never -- if you'd asked us 10 years ago, will you ever have 150 of your 600 US locations doing over $300 million and 40 of them doing over $400 million? The answer would be no, no way, even with inflation. The fact is, is we're doing a lot more volume than we've ever thought we would do. And so the biggest answer of not only making it a little more efficient, but driving more sales is cannibalizing. We find existing members that sometimes will say, I don't want to go there. It's too busy today. And by opening up that third or fourth unit in that city, we're seeing not an increase of by a third or fourth of the membership base, but a significant increase in sales. And I can't think of anything specifically. We're always doing things with -- Oh, David mentioned something here. One of the things we're in -- we should be doing shortly is having warehouse inventory online. So when you go online to -- now, I say that a couple of people in the room are smiling and says it may be a few months or a few more than a few months, but it'll be soon. But at the end of the day, if you look at something to buy online and we have it in the location or two in the zip code where you typically shop -- in the location you would shop physically, we'll let you know you can buy it there. And in many cases, it'll be cheaper if you go pick it up yourself because the online cost might be higher. It's typically higher, particularly on the non-food items. So, I think that's something that'll help that as well.\nJohn Heinbockel: And secondly, is there any way to tell you think about email outreach. I mean, it seems to be getting better and more call to action. I try to think about the seven days of spring, which are in the middle of now. Is there a way to tell the productivity of that outreach? And is that driving some of the e-com pickup?\nRichard Galanti: Absolutely. And yes, there is a way to tell. We're looking at it. Again, without going into a lot of detail, a couple of years ago, we brought in a new person in charge from IT in terms of all digital. He's built a team. They're working closely with merchants and operators, but mostly with merchants in terms of doing these types of things. And we've seen, again, lots of improvements with our app, with our desktop. It's getting less clunky by the day and more ability to do some items to drive sales and some promotions like that.\nJohn Heinbockel: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nChris Horvers: Good evening and we'll miss you, Richard, and welcome aboard, Gary. So, on the MFI, can -- did you mention how much the FX impacted total MFI growth year-over-year? And more broadly, it seems like it's becoming more competitive to acquire customers in the club channel. Couponing amongst your peers has really accelerated over the past year. Is that what you've observed? And do you think it's still escalating? And how are you responding?\nRichard Galanti: I got to tell you, we in the last 12 months, we opened like 3% new locations. We had a 7%-plus increase in new members. So we're not finding -- we do a few promotional things, but I would say we have not increased the types of things we do at all. And you're right. At other places, there's not a day that goes by you can't get a deep discount, much deeper than we've even ever done on an ongoing basis. And so, no, we're not doing anything different. We're -- I mean, are we pleasantly surprised by the rate of new signups? Yes. It's nice to hear and have. And I think the fact that things like social media has helped us with the value proposition. And so, no, we're not doing a lot of things in that regard.\nChris Horvers: And just from a technical question, what are your peers talks about tenure renewal rate? The 93% that you quote, does that include like the year-one renewal or anyone that comes to the door on one of those digital coupons?\nRichard Galanti: Yes. It does. And we've been doing the same way forever.\nChris Horvers: Got it. Thank you very much and best of luck.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line Robby Holmes with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nRobert Holmes: Oh, hey, Richard. My congrats as well. You will be missed very much. Listen, just a quick question. I love the credit card rewards program. It's amazing. It's like the best thing that's ever happened to me. The Citi Card you guys do. Is there any issue or change with the late fees or anything going on that could change the rewards program or anything there?\nRichard Galanti: Well, that's the new recent headline of that's happening and we'll have to wait and see. Look, at the end of the day, it may change the economics. There are other levers that we've talked to them in the past, our issuing bank about what we could do, but nothing is done at this point.\nRobert Holmes: Got it. Thanks again and congrats on your retirement.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nLaura Champine: Thanks for taking my question and wish you a long and happy retirement, Richard. It is -- I'm going to go out on a nitpick on the renewal rate. If renewal rate is flat overall, but 10 bps better US and Canada, that seems to imply it's not as good in international markets. Is that just some of the sampling that went on in China or what do you think might be driving that?\nRichard Galanti: Well, that's exactly what it is. When -- first of all, if you think -- if you just take the total number of members divided by total number warehouses, I think we're about close to 70,000 households per location. When we open a unit in, not only China, but other countries in Asia, we'll have anywhere from 80,000 to 150,000 members that sign up, many of whom we are looking to lose and a year later don't renew. We will start in some new countries with -- once the first batch renew for the first time, you might have a renewal rate in the 50%s or at best low-60%s. And then it just -- over the next four or five years, it continues to grow to something that's higher than that that's higher than that. That's more extreme than we saw 30 years ago in the US and Canada. But nonetheless, that's exactly what you see. So, when you're just opening the one unit in Shenzhen or whenever we open [Technical Difficulty] a year and a half ago in China, that's going to affect the international renewal rate. When we look at all other countries, when we look at the 13, the 11 other operations outside of US and Canada, their renewal rate generally ticks up a little bit every year, like the US and Canada. And US and Canada, by the way, has been helped also with increased penetration of executive members. We have that in several countries, but not all countries. The smallest countries, we don't have it in a number of units. And also with auto renewal, which has helped us in the last several years. And that's I don't believe everywhere.\nLaura Champine: Got it. That's helpful. Once those clubs mature, the clubs in China, other clubs, new clubs in Asian markets, etc., do they tend to -- can you serve a higher number of households there? Meaning, would you expect them to be sustainably above that 70,000 or so households that you have in an average club?\nRichard Galanti: Well, the answer is it is and it does. So, the answer is yes. Yes, I was at an open -- I was at -- two months after it opened in Osaka, Japan, back in October, and on a Sunday, a random Sunday was not there on business, but a random Sunday went over there. You couldn't move in the place. And it was -- and it was great. It was a wonderful picture to see. So, yes, I think that despite the fact that not everybody has cars and despite the fact that people have smaller housing arrangements, value plays well.\nLaura Champine: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jeffries. Your line is open.\nCorey Tarlowe: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. And congrats Richard on your retirement. As it relates to big ticket discretionary items, it seems like that category has improved a little bit. Just wanted to get a little bit of understanding as to what you've seen that's underlying that improvement in trend. And then secondarily on AI, just curious with the recent technology enhancements that the business has made, how you see that impacting the business on a go-forward basis?\nRichard Galanti: Sure. Well, in terms of big ticket discretionary, I think we completely believe that it's some of the things we're doing on our side to better explain the value. I mean, we -- it was almost like you did that and sales skyrocketed, 20% and 30% increases in some of those big ticket categories just over the last couple of months. Even if a piece of it is a year-over-year comparison, which I don't even know if it is or it isn't, at the end of the day, it was very evident to us. And the other comment I mentioned, particularly like on appliances, we're still a very, very small percentage of the total industry. And so it's easier to take market share when you're such a small percent of something. So, I think that'll continue. As regards to AI, we're just in the early innings of that. We've had third-party AI companies, large companies, including ones that are headquartered in Seattle, come out and talk to us. We -- where there's a whole list of things that we're doing with working with IT and our CEO and our heads of operations and merchandising to see where and how it might fit. So, that'll be a question for Gary in the future.\nCorey Tarlowe: Great. Thank you very much, and best of luck.\nRichard Galanti: Well, thank you, everyone. Again, it's been fun. The thing I miss most about the job is talking to everybody because I like talking. It's been a great story to tell, but it's been an absolute privilege and I appreciate it. So, have a good day and I'm sure we'll be speaking to some of you shortly over the next few days with additional questions. Have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes this conference call. You may now disconnect.",

This year's results included a tax benefit of $94 million or $0.21 per diluted share due to the deductibility of the $15 per share special dividend to the extent received by our employee 401(k) plan participants. Net sales for the second quarter was $57.33 billion, an increase of 5.7% from the $54.24 billion in the second quarter last year. Net sales were negatively impacted by approximately 1.5% in the US and worldwide from the shift of the fiscal calendar as a result of the 53-week 2023 fiscal year. The following comparable sales reflect comparable locations year-over-year and comparable retail weeks. For the -- in the US, we reported a 4.3% comparable. Excluding gas, deflation, and FX, the 4.3% would have been a 4.8%. Canada reported comp of -- for the quarter 9.2%, 9.0% ex-gas and FX. Other International 8.6%, and 8.2% ex-gas and FX. Total company 5.6% reported for the quarter, and a 5.8% excluding gas, deflation, and FX. E-commerce was an 18.4% reported, and an 18.2% excluding FX. In terms of second quarter comp sales metrics, our traffic or shopping frequency increased by 5.3% worldwide and 4.3% in the US. Foreign -- our average transaction or ticket was up three tenth of a percent worldwide and up one tenth of a percent in the US. And foreign currencies relative to the US dollar positively impact sales by approximately two tenth of a percent. While gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately four tenth of a percent minus. Moving down the income statement to membership fee income. We reported membership fee income of $1.111 billion, up $84 million or up 8.2% year-over-year in the quarter. In terms of renewal rates, at second quarter end, our US and Canada renewal rate came in at 92.9%, which is up one tenth of a percent from Q1 and 12 weeks earlier. And the worldwide rate came in also at 90.5%, similar to the last quarter. Membership growth continues. We ended the second quarter with 73.4 million paid household members, up 7.8% versus last year, and 132.0 million cardholders, up 7.3%, with continuing growth throughout the quarters. At Q2 end, we had 33.9 million paid executive members, an increase of 646,000 during the 12-week second quarter. Executive members represent a little over 46% of paid members and a little over 73% of worldwide sales. Moving down the income statement line, next, to the gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the second quarter was higher year-over-year by 8 basis points, coming in at 10.80% compared to 10.72% last year in the quarter, and at 4 basis points excluding gas deflation. Writing down the little matrix that we usually do with two columns, both reported and excluding gas deflation. First line item is core merchandise, plus 5% -- plus 5 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis, and plus 2 basis points ex-deflation -- gas deflation. Ancillary and other, plus 7 basis points and plus 6 basis points. 2% reward, minus 7 basis points and minus 7 basis points. LIFO, plus 3 basis points and plus 3 basis points. And all told, total reported, again, gross margin year-over-year up 8 basis points and up 4 basis points excluding gas deflation. In terms of the core margin on their own sales, again, while the number I just read you was a plus 5% -- plus 5 basis points and plus 2 basis points ex-gas deflation. In terms of core margin on their own sales, our core-on-core margins were up 25 basis points year-over-year, with food and sundries and non-foods being positive year-over-year and fresh being negative. Ancillary and other businesses, gross margins were higher by 7 basis points and higher by 6 basis points ex-gas. The increase year-over-year was driven largely by e-comm and partially offset by gas. 2% reward, again higher 7 basis points -- lower by 7 basis points both with and without gas deflation, with higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. LIFO, plus 3 basis points. We had a $14 million LIFO credit in the second quarter of this year compared to no LIFO charge or credit in the second quarter of last year. Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the second quarter was higher year-over-year by 3 basis points or minus 3 basis points would be higher, coming in at -- this year at 9.14% compared to last year's 9.11%. And the higher 0.3% would have been lower by 1 basis point excluding gas deflation. In terms of Q2 year-over-year, the operations component of SG&A, doing the matrix, was 11 basis points higher, or minus 11 basis points. Ex-gas deflation, minus 8 basis points, so 8 basis points higher. Central, plus 4 basis points and plus 5 basis points. Stock compensation, plus 4 basis points and plus 4 basis points. And total would be 3 basis points higher year-over-year and plus 1 basis point or 1 basis point lower year-over-year or better. And with regard to the operations component being higher by 11 basis points reported and 8 basis points excluding deflation. As compared to a year ago, since -- during the past year, we included two last March's extra top-of-scale increase in wages, which was about a 2 basis point hit to the SG&A line. As well, in the first quarter of this year we raised the starting wage in the US and Canada. We estimate the impact of that new wage also was a roughly 2 basis point. So, about 4 basis points of that 8 basis points or 4 basis points of that 11 basis points were related to those two wage increases, more than normal. Below the operating income line, Central I mentioned was better by 4 basis points or 5 basis points, and the rest was pretty much straightforward. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $41 million this year versus $34 million last year and interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $102 million year-over-year. This was driven by an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates and higher average cash balances, as well as FX which was favorable versus last year. We'll see less benefit from interest income going forward following the January payment of the $6.7 billion special dividend. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the second quarter came in at 22.1% compared to 26.1% in Q2 last year. As discussed earlier, this year's rate benefited from the tax deductibility of a special dividend paid to 401(k) participants. The fiscal 2024 effective tax rate including discrete items is currently projected to be in the 26% to 27% range. And excluding the special dividend tax benefit in Q2, our Q2 tax rate instead of being -- coming in at 22.1% would have been 26.3%. Overall, reported net income was up 18.9% in the quarter on a reported basis. And again, excluding the special dividend-related income tax benefit, it would have been up 12.5% year-over-year. A few other items of note. In terms of openings in the second quarter, we opened four net new warehouses, including three new locations in the US. Actually, two of them were Costco business centers, and one new Costco Wholesale warehouse, and one unit in -- our sixth in China in mid-January in Shenzhen. That's our six in China. There's been a lot of press about it. We have an estimated 10,000 people who were at opening and there are just under 200,000 members currently, including more than 20,000 members who signed-up from Hong Kong. And we've seen all kinds of things over there from tour agencies doing bus trips over to shop. For the full year 2024, we estimate 30 total openings, including two relo's, so for a net increase of 28 new units. And that puts the remainder of fiscal 2024 for Q3 and Q4, we plan on opening a total of 15 net new locations, 11 in the US, two in Japan, and one each in Korea and in China. Regarding CapEx, fiscal second quarter spend was approximately $1.03 billion. And for the year, it remains in the north of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion, in that range. One additional comment on China. This past Monday, we launched in our Pudong, China location, the ability for our members to order online about 400 items from our -- of our items to be delivered that day. This -- and the delivery will be within about an eight kilometer radius of the warehouse itself. That's getting a lot of social media attention over there and we plan to launch it in the other four Shanghai area locations by month-end, as well as in Shenzhen sometime the following month. In terms of e-commerce, e-commerce sales in Q2 ex-FX increased 18.2%. E-com showed strength in several areas, led by sales of gold and very recently silver. As well, appliances were very, very strong, as was gift cards and e-tickets. As well, Costco Logistics enjoyed record-breaking deliveries. Much of that -- many of those items are sold via e-commerce. In Q2 of 2024, we completed over 1 million deliveries, up 28% versus Q2 a year ago. In terms of e-commerce sales over the past few months, we believe we've done a much better job explaining to our members the significant value propositions we offer compared to traditional competitors in several big-ticket categories. Under the Why Buy At Costco banner and The Price You See Is The Price You Pay banner, we share with our members what's included in the price of appliances, tires, televisions, computers, and mattresses. You can see these online on our website of Why Buy At Costco. Just to give you one example. If you take a four-set of high-end tires compared to a traditional retailer, we include, of course, installation, rotation, balancing, a five-year road hazard warranty. Typically that's a lot less road hazard warranty than other places, or you'd have to pay for it extra, ongoing flat repairs, nitrogen, and disposal of the prior tires. So, just one of the examples where the price of the tires itself might be very close to us. When you put in all the differences of those additional items, it's anywhere from a 15% to 25% savings on any of these items. Next on my list, talk about costconext.com, a couple of comments on the seller platform. This allows -- costconext.com allows our members to exclusive asset -- access to direct-to-consumer sites for top-quality brands at Costco value pricing. Currently, there are about 70 -- there are 70 Costco Next brand sites, with 15 additional sites in development. We will likely end this calendar year with about 90 sites and continue to grow from there. Costco Next offers everything from home improvement to apparel to pet to home to kitchen to electronics to accessories, as well as sports, bicycles, and toys. You should check it out, it's a pretty good site. Progress continues to be made in our e-com, mobile, and digital efforts. A couple of recent enhancements. In February, we rolled out our new native mobile application homepage on iOS. The native homepage now loads in less than 2 seconds compared to 8 seconds previously. Needless to say, that's important when about 60% of our e-com business, both visitors and orders, are now done via our mobile app and browser. And last week, we rolled out Apple Pay to all members online, both web and mobile, on February 28th. App downloads during the quarter were up 2.8 million and currently total around 33 million. On the product side, a couple of other new items to comment on. In our food courts, we recently replaced the churro with an awesome freshly baked 5.5-ounce chocolate chip cookie for $2.49. It is awesome. It's a great-tasting -- and a great-tasting turkey sandwich for $6.99, with the rollout of the latter being completed this week. In addition, we recently opened our first fully operated sushi offering in Issaquah, Washington, across the street from our headquarters, with two more planned to open in the very near future. This operation is what we have successfully done for years -- for many years, and throughout our Asia Costcos and several countries over there. The sushi program has proven to be a category where we can be successful in both quality and price, and we're looking forward to seeing more of that in the future. A couple of comments about inflation. In the last quarter, in the first quarter, we estimated that year-over-year inflation was approximately zero to 1%. We'll now say that in Q2, it was essentially flat. And notwithstanding essentially flat, we're taking price reductions where we can. Anecdotally, everything from simple items like reading glasses from $18.99 to $16.99, the 48 count of Kirkland Signature batteries from $17.99 to $15.99, a 24 count of Pellegrino from $16.99 to $14.99, and even a four pounds of frozen three berry fruit blend from $14.99 down to $10.99 with new crop pricing. So, we continue to do that. We always want to be the first out there trying to lower prices. Many new items in sporting goods and lawn and garden are being set with lower prices year-over-year, and overall, mostly due to reduced freight costs and lower commodity costs versus a year ago. And overall, our inventories and SKUs are in good shape across all channels. Overall, we've had good seasonal sell-through during the quarter. In terms of shipping and supply chain issues, we've been asked about that often of late. There are some delays, generally just a couple to three weeks, but mostly now planned for. First, there was an issue a while back with the Panama Canal challenges. Then, of course, the Red Sea challenges. A lot of that has to do with changing the way ships are being routed. No meaningful pricing issues because a lot have been placed contracts. Finally, turning to our February sales results, the four weeks ended this past Sunday, March 3rd, compared to the same retail calendar weeks last year. As reported in our release, that sales for the month came in at $18.21 billion, an increase of 6.9%, versus $17.04 billion for the same four retail weeks last year. Again, just to announce what we did in the announcement earlier today, the US reported comp of 3.4% for February, ex-gas and FX, 4.1%. Canada, 8.4% and 8.3%. Other international, 10.8% and 11.3%. For our total Company, a 5.0% reported and a 5.6% ex-gas and FX, with e-com coming in at a 16.2% reported and a 16.0% ex-FX. Our comp traffic or frequency for February was up 6.2% worldwide and up 5.0% in the US. Foreign currencies year-over-year relative to the dollar negatively impacted total and comparable sales as follows: Canada by about one tenth of a percent negative; other international by approximately 0.5%; and total Company by approximately one tenth of a percent. Gasoline price deflation negatively impacted total reported comp sales by approximately 0.5%, and the average worldwide selling price per gallon of gas was down approximately 3.5% versus last year. Worldwide, the average transaction for February was down about 1.1%, which includes the negative impacts from FX and gas deflation. In terms of regional and merchandising categories, the general highlights are as follows: US regions with the strongest comps were Midwest, Southeast, and Northeast. In terms of other international in local currencies, we saw strength in Mexico, Australia, and Korea. Moving to merchandise highlights, food and sundries were positive in the mid-single-digits. Fresh foods were up high-single-digits, and non-foods were positive mid-single-digits. And ancillary businesses were up in the low-single-digits. Food court, pharmacy, and optical were top performers, with gas down low-single-digits on a lower price per gallon. In terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our March sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, April 7th on the following Wednesday, April 10th after market close. And lastly, before I turn it back to Demi for Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to say thank you to many of you who have turned in to each quarter, some for many years, to allow me to share with you Costco's results, both our ups and our downs, and thankfully many more ups than downs, and provide some fun and informative color on how we're doing along the way. Since going public in December of 1985, I have hosted all but one call and it's been an absolute privilege and honor to do so. So, thank you all. As you know, in early February, it was announced that I will be ceding the role of CFO to Gary Millerchip effective March 15th after our second quarter 10-Q is filed, and retire, including from our Board, next January. It's a bit surreal of late, but what a wonderful journey it has been with such a great Company and great people, including many of you on the call today. I have certainly been very fortunate. The good news, Gary joined Costco last week, and along with David and Josh, will continue to provide to you all with the transparency and straightforwardness that we are known for. It will be a positive and seamless transition. With that, I will be happy to turn it back to Demi to open it up for Q&A. Sure. And by the way, it's when, not if, still. And but really, joking aside, we're not that smart in terms of figuring out exactly why. I mean we know that all the factors that we believe, if we wanted to do it, would we feel comfortable in terms of renewal rates, new member signups, loyalty, all those things are continuing in the right direction. It really is a function. And I don't think it would be done simply because, hey, things have slowed down a little bit, let's do it now. We like the fact that we're performing well. We like the fact that almost all metrics are going in the right direction in our business right now. We've got plenty of runway left. And given the economy and given everything else, it's us, it's Costco, so I think it is simply still not trying to be accede about it, it's not some big analytical formula, it's simply a measure of we will at some point, I'm sure, do it. And I've been joking with Gary, it'll be on his watch, not mine. Right. Well, I would say it's probably more likely to go up a little bit down just because of whatever goes on in life with inflation that happened. But I got to look back at the last few years. We were -- we and others were helped through the crisis of COVID. And we haven't given a lot of that back. If I look at our SG&A, I remember when in fiscal 2019, it came in at a $10.04 billion. I'm looking at these numbers here. And even in 2020, it was at a $10.30 billion in the first quarter before COVID. And then in fiscal 2021, it was at $9.65 billion and then down to an $8.88 billion. And now it's up to fiscal 2023, it was a $9.08 billion. So, notwithstanding that, I remember when it was slightly above $10 billion, we said, well, it's never going to get below $10 billion again. And a lot of factors continue to change. But just the sheer high productivity that we have is frankly higher than we thought. Some of that was gained through COVID because of everything else going on. But we haven't given it back. The good news is, we haven't given it back. And the good news continues to be that we seem to continue to be able to take market share. I think the fact that on big-ticket items, there's less SG&A. We continue to change the pack sizes of things for less freight, whatever it is. Although freight would be, that would be SG&A. But it is still a lot about sales at the end. And if you ask the rhetorical question, if comps went to zero, what would that mean? That would be tough on SG&A, but we'd figure other things out. Well, first of all, nothing has changed. It's not unlike the same question I think that was asked of Jim Senegal after 28 years before he retired, and before we knew who his successor was going to exactly be. And I remember the Board asking, if you're 100 in terms of extreme value and extreme taking care of the customer and the employee and everybody else, whoever takes your place, what will they be? And he paused for a minute and said, I have no doubt they'll be at least in the mid-90s if not higher. And frankly, after Craig was made that, in my view, whatever that number was, it increased towards a 100 just because that's what we do. That culture is so ingrained here. And we talk about changing management. I always joke when people ask me as CFO how I'm important -- am I important to the strategic whatever of the Company? The fact is, is we're run by merchants and operators, and we're there to serve and help them and certainly add our voice. But the fact of the matter is, and Craig for 12 years and now in Ron, you have people that have been here for 35, 40 years and were born and raised and have grown up in this culture. And it is so intact. Just last week when Gary joined us, he had to go through the required two-hour Costco orientation, which includes the obey the law, to take care of your customer, to take care of your employee, to respect your supplier. And then if you do that, you can reward the shareholder. It is -- that's the one thing I can sleep very well at night. Thanks. No. First of all, when I said most, I was just trying to be human, that nobody is perfect. Everything is working in the right direction right now. And actually, I wasn't talking just about membership metrics, but in general, knock on wood, things are working pretty well. When I -- when we sit in at our monthly budget meeting, more times than not, we get pretty excited about what's going on from a new merchandising standpoint, newness, buying with conviction, and being aggressive and assertive out there. I mean, what we saw with just even that simple example I gave you with changes to big ticket items and why buy them at Costco, we saw great changes in numbers. So, we know that we've got a lot of levers to be able to pull to make this thing work. And so no, I just said, honestly, I said most because nobody is perfect. I didn't have any particular examples. Yes. And no, and absolutely. When -- what is it? It's called -- it used to be NPD, it's Circana, which is that industry that shows you how you are on different product -- non-food product categories versus the industry. When we look at something like appliances in the last several weeks or a couple of months, the industry is flat and we're up north of 20%. Same thing with tires, more than that percent. And so, now that you can't say, let's do everything and everything will be up 20% or 30% because that's not going to happen. But at the end of the day, the focus of the buyers, as an example, is coming up with new ways to do things, to have great pricing, and to constantly improve that pricing and figure out how to do that with our global buying power with -- every time there's a commodity price increase. Given an item business, we have buyers that are in charge of 20 and 30 items, if not less, not 200 and 300 items in a category. They know a lot more, in our view, about every cost component of that. And I think -- I feel very good that we do a very good job, and I'm not suggesting others don't, but I know we do a very good job of getting on the phone immediately and working those issues. And as soon as we can get a savings, we're out there first passing it on. And that's just our religion. Now, we're able to do that partly because our sales have been relatively strong, and we've lapped some things from last year that have helped. There's not a lot of trade down, although when we -- we sometimes have more control over certain private labeled CPG items that we're able to drive more business, and so we're seeing an increased penetration of that versus some of the brands sometimes. But then that gets the brands to the table to work to provide more value on the branded as well. We want to be both. But we haven't really seen -- that was a question that happened as \"the economy was\" -- the question is, are we going into a recession, a couple of years ago, and inflation was peaking at 7%, 8%, and 9%, and are we seeing a difference? So, we did see a -- if you look back over the last 20 years, and without looking at the exact numbers, it seems like every year we'd grow a 0.25% to a 0.5% of increased Kirkland Signature penetration. And then there was one year when we were asked a couple of years ago, it seemed like there was 1% to -- 1.5% to 2% -- even 2% change in penetration. So, people were, in my view, switching a little bit out, but that's changed. We don't see that as much anymore. What is done strategically, I hate to overuse that word, it's allowed us to be much better in value and delivery times and quality, and brought the delivery costs down on big ticket items, particularly appliances and big screen televisions, mattresses, and furniture, indoor and outdoor patio and mattress and patio furniture and indoor furniture, some sporting goods. And before we bought Innovel, we're now called Costco Logistics in the spring of 2020. And the year before that, in the US, we did about 2.2 million drops. And a drop is anything from dropping off a sofa to delivering and installing a new refrigerator, freezer, or washer, dryer, and taking the old one away for disposal. Both of those are a drop, recognizing their extreme difference there. But we did about 2.2 million drops in the US, none of which we did ourselves. With the acquisition of Innovel, I think for the - probably over the last -- with this million this quarter, a rough number of 4 million drops, which I believe about 70% of them -- over 4 million drops, and about 70% of them is us. We've reduced the delivery times. We've just introduced in some categories like two-hour windows where you can -- or three-hour windows where you can choose, two-hour windows where you can choose. So, we're constantly getting better, and we've greatly improved the value. And when you look at something, a category like appliances, we're still a very low percentage of the industry. And, the fact that it was up, 20%-plus last month or last quarter, is a function of some of the things we're doing in terms of shouting out how good of a deal it is and doing a better job of that. But we think we have an opportunity to continue to grow those categories, recognizing they're all meaningful categories, but they're all small percentages of our total. That's one of the nice things about us that we have lots of different categories. Thank you. Well, on the non-food side, the biggest thing is -- well, not the big -- a piece of it is comparing to last year when we had extra markdowns. I think we probably talked about it last time that non-food was -- a year ago had been down year-over-year because of some of the supply chain challenges we had when such things were coming in late after the season in case some of the big ticket items from overseas containers. So, that was probably a chunk of it. On the Fresh food side, I said it was down year-over-year a little. Fresh is competitive, and we're being ever competitive on it as well. And -- but again, I don't view any of that as being terribly meaningful in terms of, is that a big change that is coming. There's always something that's up a little bit, and there's another thing that's down a little bit. I can't think off the top of my head other than I -- actually, someone across the table has just said the word focus. At our budget meetings, which happen every four weeks with 150-plus people in town from all over the world, those are the kind of things we look at. And I think the operators are doing a better job of budgeting. And one of the things I think that came out at the last budget meeting in terms of budgeting, if you budget sales a little higher and they came in a percentage -- a percent lower, you've got to your labor costs. And so a lot of it has to do with focus and being meaningful about it. We certainly don't try to control expenses by not doing a wage increase when we think we need to, and we certainly have done that. Thanks. Thank you. Well, in a way, we're doing the same thing here with a few people, most notably Instacart. And a little bit was shipped down in the Southeast. And I think we've got a test in Texas with Uber. But at the end of the day, we had that same-day delivery already as function. Over there, it is a third-party that's doing it, like Instacart or these other ventures here. So, it's just -- it's new. It's not something that's new to the warehouse club industry in China. You could look elsewhere and find it too. But it's certainly something that makes sense. And again, in part because of social media, there's been a lot of publicity and just, I mean, from the day it launched three days ago, it's gone nuts in terms of how many page hits it's getting and all that stuff. But it's just part of the business. I think, who knows, but I think generally it probably trends up a little. There was a few years there, excluding the year when COVID hit, that we only did like 13 because there were shutdowns in certain countries of construction and as well as the US. But if you look back, excluding that year over a three or five-year period, plus or minus a couple of years there, it was about 23 a unit. Without looking at numbers, about 23 units a year. At the time, you said, what do you see over the next 10 years? What we saw collectively was is somewhere in the, hopefully, targeting, let's say, 25 for the next five years per year, and then going up to 25 to somewhere in the high-20s, if not 30. I think that's generally the sense that we feel. Could we do more? Yes. Are we comfortable doing it this way? Yes. I think part of that is it's such a hands-on business. I get to say that from sitting here in headquarters most of the time, not traveling like my colleagues do in operations. But, Ron is a great example. I mean, he and several regional executives in operations, if there's an opening somewhere, or not an opening, they're out visiting, usually at least two, if not three weeks a month, or out for three or four days, jumping around, visiting locations, not only existing locations, but new sites. And so, I think from a standpoint -- and the other thing is, particularly in newer countries, you want to get the first one open so you can train 50 or 80 people that want to move to the next location in that city that'll help that one go. And we were very fortunate a few years back in the first Shanghai, in Minhang in China, where we had a number of employees from Taiwan that wanted to move and be promoted into new locations, new jobs over there. So, that helps us when we have one, then two, then four, then whatever. So we take it slow. All I know is, we're all very busy, and, particularly the operators and merchants as well. And so that's kind of the paradigm that I think that we're going to continue to work at. Something in the 25 range, and then heading up. Just a month -- just a quarter ago, I think our budget for this year was 32, and now -- or 31, now it's 28. And that's simply timing. There is two or three that are pushed, that for whatever, construction delays, or you found something in the soil delays, or whatever it might be, they might have moved from mid to late summer to early fall, which is the new fiscal year. So, I'm feeling pretty good that we're going to open 25-plus for the next couple of years, and then probably 28-plus, and go on from there. Well, I think that, again, the inflation number is a calculation based on costs and mix. I think it's probably -- I wouldn't look too closely if the average ticket was up a couple of -- a few tenths in the quarter, and then it was down a percent, down in February by a tenth. That's still relatively close. Some of it's a mix change, I'm sure, and some of it is -- some of the examples I gave you about lower pricing. Even if the underlying cost hasn't changed, some of it may be in terms of how we package, and we take advantage of that. So -- and that's on the sales side and not on -- not the exact cost from yesterday. Yes. I think when I go to the last budget meeting two weeks ago, I think there's -- in the presentations, there's a lot of -- I used the phrase a few minutes ago, upscaling. I didn't use that phrase, but then buying with conviction. I mean, I think the buyers are looking ahead right now in an offensive way and a positive way. Hopefully, we'll be right, but we feel so far we're being right. Yes. Instacart is 1.5% to 2% percent, something below 2%, but more to 1.5%, which is still on a $200 billion retailer, it's a lot. And we don't include that because that -- the Instacart person comes in, buys it, and checks out at the front end, so we don't include that. So, you'd add -- depending on rounding, you'd add 1% to 2% to the top-line number. I hope to see you all. Well, without giving numbers out, we know there's an opportunity there more than we've done in the past. In the last six or eight months, we've brought on people that are seasoned in this business to help us, and it's a point of focus. We know that there's money out there. We've always been very successful in other forms of vendor buckets, whether it's end caps or advertising in our own Costco connection. And, of course, over the last several years, some advertising online or banners or placement, but there's a lot more that can be done there. Rest assured, whatever it is, we're going to use it to -- just like when we always said if we can save a dollar on buying something, we're going to give $0.80 or $0.90 to the customer. I think that mantra will continue on this side as well. So -- but there's certainly ability for more dollars out there. Some of our big retail competitors have talked about doubling in five or six years what they have. I think, again, it's a lower market share for us, so there's a little more opportunity for us to continue to grow that. Yes, on e-commerce, there's not as many stored cards for our members. And as we're doing more with a digital wallet, that'll help as well. So, it's something that should help. Well, we definitely have seen an impact from it. I think historically, the view was it has to be at least as good, if not better quality than the leading national brand, and at least a 20% savings as compared to what we sell the national brand for. And those metrics continue in that regard. I think what we've seen when we look at some of the items that have risen greatly in price, like paper products, on a percentage basis over the last several years because of freight costs, because of pulp prices, because of energy, all those things have dramatically increased. And what used to be -- I don't know the exact numbers, but for an 18-pack of -- a 24-pack of toilet tissue or a 15-pack or 18-pack of paper towels, you've got price points in the high $20s, if not low-to-mid $30s. And where we can show a dramatic savings on that, we've seen dramatic changes in unit market share towards Costco -- towards Kirkland Signature. But that's something that's been an iterative process over many years, probably goes up and down a little bit. I'd say it's gone up a little bit in terms of a little more of a penetration in the last couple of years. I don't think there's a big difference. In new markets, it's always a little slower. So, like when we opened originally in Iceland or Sweden or Auckland or some of those or France several years ago, you're always going to start -- or frankly, Japan 20 years ago, you tend to start out lower. In some cases, it's also a question is, some local vendors may not want to -- local country vendors may not want to sell you because they want to upset all the big traditional that have all the market share before we enter. And once we get two or three open, they talk to you a little more. And so I think all those things help us as we grow. Certainly, it's changed a little bit in the last few years. China being the most recent example, when we opened the first one in Minhang in Shanghai, what, about four years ago? It made international news based on just the sheer number of members we signed up and everything. So we have a lot faster start, I think. Each year, we have a lot faster start than the year before. And so I don't see a big difference there. We certainly -- if you look in the US, I mean, I think one thing that's interesting is this fiscal year, we're going to open, whatever, 28 units. Let me get my page here. And, I think of the 28, 20-plus are in the US, which is -- some people have asked, has it slowed down internationally? No, international takes a little longer to do. But what's interesting is, is we have a lot more runway than we ever thought possible. If you had asked us five years ago, by now, how many would we be putting in this year in the US? We would not have said 20-plus. It's got to slow down at some point. But the volumes that we're now doing in these locations, we've got to bleed some of that off. And so that's one good point. And then we've still got plenty going on overseas. And you'll see that continue to ramp up as well. Thanks. No, I think part of it is -- first of all, I think the storyline sometimes is a little greater than the reality. During COVID, we did a little bit more. There was a little bit more membership sharing. You had individuals where one family member, maybe not the one that had one of the two memberships, was coming into shop with mom or dad's credit card. And we allowed it. And then with the advent of self-checkout over the last several years, when you walk in the front door and you just flash your card and do they look at it or not, who knows, you would -- people would get in. And if you're going through self-checkout, you're not having to show your membership card to the cashier. And so there's probably an increasing but still small level of abuse of that privilege. And -- but we also had complaints from members saying, I pay, why shouldn't they? So, the view was -- is we needed to just shore that up a little bit. And we did. We did it over a period of six months, I think about six months, where we -- first there was warnings, and then ultimately changed. Are we getting some new signups from it? Absolutely. But it's relative to the 60 million or 70 million members, it's not terribly meaningful. But it's more fair and the right thing to do. Right. Well, it seems like Netflix had a much bigger issue or the ability to share was much easier because, first of all, it's electronic. In this sense, you still have to show a card when you walked in. And we're actually doing testing on that too, in terms of having your card be scanned and reviewed when you walk in. And we've done that in the UK, I believe, for a few years. And so it's all about -- just I would say it's as much hygiene as anything else. And it'll be slightly profitable to the extent that we make sure everybody -- I think we signed up more members than there were non-members then lost the small sales that that non-member did. Thank you. I think the biggest challenge with pain points, first of all, is full of merchandise and pallets through the system, which we continue to work on and improve. Never -- if you'd asked us 10 years ago, will you ever have 150 of your 600 US locations doing over $300 million and 40 of them doing over $400 million? The answer would be no, no way, even with inflation. The fact is, is we're doing a lot more volume than we've ever thought we would do. And so the biggest answer of not only making it a little more efficient, but driving more sales is cannibalizing. We find existing members that sometimes will say, I don't want to go there. It's too busy today. And by opening up that third or fourth unit in that city, we're seeing not an increase of by a third or fourth of the membership base, but a significant increase in sales. And I can't think of anything specifically. We're always doing things with -- Oh, David mentioned something here. One of the things we're in -- we should be doing shortly is having warehouse inventory online. So when you go online to -- now, I say that a couple of people in the room are smiling and says it may be a few months or a few more than a few months, but it'll be soon. But at the end of the day, if you look at something to buy online and we have it in the location or two in the zip code where you typically shop -- in the location you would shop physically, we'll let you know you can buy it there. And in many cases, it'll be cheaper if you go pick it up yourself because the online cost might be higher. It's typically higher, particularly on the non-food items. So, I think that's something that'll help that as well. Absolutely. And yes, there is a way to tell. We're looking at it. Again, without going into a lot of detail, a couple of years ago, we brought in a new person in charge from IT in terms of all digital. He's built a team. They're working closely with merchants and operators, but mostly with merchants in terms of doing these types of things. And we've seen, again, lots of improvements with our app, with our desktop. It's getting less clunky by the day and more ability to do some items to drive sales and some promotions like that. I got to tell you, we in the last 12 months, we opened like 3% new locations. We had a 7%-plus increase in new members. So we're not finding -- we do a few promotional things, but I would say we have not increased the types of things we do at all. And you're right. At other places, there's not a day that goes by you can't get a deep discount, much deeper than we've even ever done on an ongoing basis. And so, no, we're not doing anything different. We're -- I mean, are we pleasantly surprised by the rate of new signups? Yes. It's nice to hear and have. And I think the fact that things like social media has helped us with the value proposition. And so, no, we're not doing a lot of things in that regard. Yes. It does. And we've been doing the same way forever. Thank you. Well, that's the new recent headline of that's happening and we'll have to wait and see. Look, at the end of the day, it may change the economics. There are other levers that we've talked to them in the past, our issuing bank about what we could do, but nothing is done at this point. Thank you. Well, that's exactly what it is. When -- first of all, if you think -- if you just take the total number of members divided by total number warehouses, I think we're about close to 70,000 households per location. When we open a unit in, not only China, but other countries in Asia, we'll have anywhere from 80,000 to 150,000 members that sign up, many of whom we are looking to lose and a year later don't renew. We will start in some new countries with -- once the first batch renew for the first time, you might have a renewal rate in the 50%s or at best low-60%s. And then it just -- over the next four or five years, it continues to grow to something that's higher than that that's higher than that. That's more extreme than we saw 30 years ago in the US and Canada. But nonetheless, that's exactly what you see. So, when you're just opening the one unit in Shenzhen or whenever we open [Technical Difficulty] a year and a half ago in China, that's going to affect the international renewal rate. When we look at all other countries, when we look at the 13, the 11 other operations outside of US and Canada, their renewal rate generally ticks up a little bit every year, like the US and Canada. And US and Canada, by the way, has been helped also with increased penetration of executive members. We have that in several countries, but not all countries. The smallest countries, we don't have it in a number of units. And also with auto renewal, which has helped us in the last several years. And that's I don't believe everywhere. Well, the answer is it is and it does. So, the answer is yes. Yes, I was at an open -- I was at -- two months after it opened in Osaka, Japan, back in October, and on a Sunday, a random Sunday was not there on business, but a random Sunday went over there. You couldn't move in the place. And it was -- and it was great. It was a wonderful picture to see. So, yes, I think that despite the fact that not everybody has cars and despite the fact that people have smaller housing arrangements, value plays well. Sure. Well, in terms of big ticket discretionary, I think we completely believe that it's some of the things we're doing on our side to better explain the value. I mean, we -- it was almost like you did that and sales skyrocketed, 20% and 30% increases in some of those big ticket categories just over the last couple of months. Even if a piece of it is a year-over-year comparison, which I don't even know if it is or it isn't, at the end of the day, it was very evident to us. And the other comment I mentioned, particularly like on appliances, we're still a very, very small percentage of the total industry. And so it's easier to take market share when you're such a small percent of something. So, I think that'll continue. As regards to AI, we're just in the early innings of that. We've had third-party AI companies, large companies, including ones that are headquartered in Seattle, come out and talk to us. We -- where there's a whole list of things that we're doing with working with IT and our CEO and our heads of operations and merchandising to see where and how it might fit. So, that'll be a question for Gary in the future. Well, thank you, everyone. Again, it's been fun. The thing I miss most about the job is talking to everybody because I like talking. It's been a great story to tell, but it's been an absolute privilege and I appreciate it. So, have a good day and I'm sure we'll be speaking to some of you shortly over the next few days with additional questions. Have a good day."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Costco Wholesale Corporation Fiscal First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. Comparable sales and comparable sales excluding impacts from changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange are intended as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP. In today's release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal '24, the 12 weeks ended November 26. Reported net income for the 12-week first quarter came in at $1.589 billion or $3.58 per share, up from $1.364 billion or $3.07 per share in the 12-week first quarter last year. This year's results included a tax benefit of $44 million or $0.10 a share related to stock-based compensation. Last year's results included a tax benefit of $53 million or $0.12 per share related to stock-based compensation and also included a charge of $93 million pre-tax or $0.15 per share primarily related to downsizing our charter shipping activities. Net sales for the first quarter were $56.72 billion, a 6.1% increase over last year's first quarter, $53.44 billion. Net sales were benefited by approximately 0.5% (ph) to 1% in the U.S. and worldwide from the shift of the fiscal calendar as a result of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023. The following comparable sales reflect comparable locations year-over-year and comparable retail weeks. In the U.S. reported 2% comp sales ex-gas deflation and FX 2.6%. Canada reported 6.4%, ex-gas and FX 8.2%. Other International reported 11.2%, ex-gas and FX 7.1%. For total company reported 3.8% and at 3.9%, excluding those two items. E-commerce, which was reported as a 6.3% came in at 6.1% excluding FX. Overall, for the first fiscal quarter, fresh foods were relatively strong once again, with food and sundries right behind. Non-food showed improvement over the September October, November time frame as did e-com sales. In terms of Q1 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 4.7% worldwide and 3.6% in the United States. Our average transaction was down 0.9% worldwide and down 1.6% in the U.S. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted sales by approximately 0.4%, while gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 0.6%. I've gotten more than a few calls in the past few weeks as to how many pies we sold in the U.S. leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday. In the U.S., in the three days leading up to Thanksgiving, we sold 2.9 million of our famous Pumpkin Pies along with 1.3 million apple and pecan pies, so over 4 million pies in total during the three days. Back to the income statement here and next on the income statement's membership fee income. In the quarter, we reported $1.082 billion or 1.91%, that's an $82 million or 8.2% increase and a 4 basis point increase over the first quarter last year. In terms of renewal rates, at first quarter end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate stood at 92.8%, while the worldwide rate came in at 90.5%. Both of these rates were up 0.1% from those numbers 12 weeks earlier at the end of the fourth quarter. Membership growth continues. We ended Q1 with 72.0 million paid household members, up 7.6% versus last year and 129.5 million cardholders, up 7.1%, with consistent growth throughout the quarters. At Q1 end, we had 33.2 million paid Executive members, an increase of 939,000 during the 12 weeks since Q4 end. Executive members now represent a little over 46% of our paid members and a little over 73% of worldwide sales. Moving down the income statement next is, our gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was higher year-over-year by 43 basis points, coming in at 11.04%, up from Q1 of last year at 10.61%. That 43 basis point reported number ex-gas deflation would be plus 36 basis points. As I normally do here, we write down two columns and six line items. The first column is reported in the first quarter. The second column is margins, excluding gas deflation. It's the year-over-year change in the first quarter. On a core merchandise, plus 3 basis points reported, minus 3 basis points ex-deflation. Ancillary and other businesses, plus 24% reported and plus 22% ex-gas deflation; 2% reward lower year-over-year, minus 4 basis points reported and minus 3 ex-gas deflation; LIFO, plus 3 and plus 3 and other plus 17 and plus 17 for a total, again, reported year-over-year up 43 basis points and ex-gas deflation up 36 basis points. Starting with the core. Again, it was total company, it was plus 3 and minus 3 reported and ex-gas deflation. In terms of core margin on their own sales, our core-on-core margins were up by 5 basis points year-over-year. Ancillary and other business gross margin, again, higher by 24 and higher by 22 ex-gas deflation. This increase was driven largely by gas and e-comm. Our 2% reward higher by 4 and higher by 3 ex-deflation, reflecting higher sales penetration coming from our Executive members. LIFO plus 3 basis points. We had a $15 million LIFO credit in the first quarter of this year. This compared to a very small $0.5 million LIFO charge in Q1 a year ago. And then, the other line item, the 17 basis points to the positive. As was mentioned earlier, last year in Q1, there was a 17 basis point impact from a $93 million pre-tax charge, primarily related -- primarily for the downsizing of our charter shipping activities. Moving on to SG&A. We reported SG&A of 9.45%, higher by 25 basis points than last year's 9.20%. Again, in Q1, we're right down the two columns. Reported and without gas deflation, operations, minus 18 and minus 14 basis points, minus being -- meaning it's higher year-over-year. Central minus 2 and minus 1. Stock compensation minus 3 and minus 2. Pre-opening expense, minus 2 and minus 2, again, for a total reported margin higher minus 25% year-over-year. I'm sorry, SG&A, not margin, 25 and without gas deflation, higher by 19 basis points. The quarter again was higher by 18 and higher by 14, excluding the impact from gas. This included 12 weeks of this past March's extra top of scale increase in our wages, which represents an estimated 2 basis point hit. And as of September 18, we raised the starting wage in the U.S. and Canada, that estimated impact from those new wages to be roughly 2 basis points as well. Again, central, nothing much to say other than its 1 basis point higher, excluding gas deflation. Again, it was stock comp's, the minus 2x gas deflation and pre-opening. We did have a couple of more openings this year in the quarter than we did last year and that was higher by 2 basis points. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $38 million this year, $4 million higher than last year's $34 million figure. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $107 million, coming in at $160 million this year versus $53 million last year. This was driven largely by the increase in interest income, about $100 million of that $107 million due to higher interest rates as well as high cash balances. The small additional impact was a favorable FX year-over-year. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the first quarter was 24.5%. This compares to 23.0% a year ago or 1.5 percentage points higher this year than last year. The increase in our rate as of Q1 -- in Q1 is primarily attributable to lower benefit from the stock-based compensation from a year ago. Overall, reported net income was up 16.5% year-over-year in the quarter. A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion in the first quarter, we opened 10 locations, including one relo (ph), so a net of nine increases. That -- those nine included eight in the U.S. and one in Canada. For the full year fiscal '24, we estimate opening -- we're planning to open 33 locations, including two relos, so for a net increase of 31 new warehouses that would be up from 23 that we opened in fiscal '23. For Q2 fiscal '24, we plan four new locations, including our sixth building in China, are early in the calendar year. Regarding capital expenditures, first quarter capital expenditure spend was approximately $1.04 billion. We estimate that fiscal '24 CapEx will be in the $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion range, that's up from $4.3 billion we had in fiscal '23, reflecting a continued increase in the number of the expansion that we're doing. In terms of e-commerce business, e-com sales in Q1 ex-FX increased 6.1%, the first quarterly year-over-year increase in five fiscal quarters and trended well during the three reporting periods of September, October, November. E-comm showed strength in several areas. In food, things like e-gift cards, pet items, snack items were up in the mid-teens. Appliances were up year-over-year in the mid-20s. TVs was actually in the high-singles despite the challenges with other aspects of consumer electronics like computers, and tires were up in the low-teens. So overall, a pretty good showing there. As well, Costco Logistics enjoyed record-breaking deliveries. In the first quarter of fiscal '24, we completed over 800,000 deliveries, which were up 17% versus the comparable quarter last year. And some fun wow items in the quarter in e-commerce. You've probably read about the fact that we're selling gold 1 ounce gold bars. We sold over $100 million of gold during the quarter. We sold a Babe Ruth autographed index card for $20,000. And in addition to e-gift cards on everything from restaurants to golf to airlines, and we just in the last couple of weeks, launched a Disney e-gift card valued at $250 for $224.99. And for you last-minute shoppers out there, there is a Mickey Mantle autographed 1951 Rookie Card in nearly perfect condition and it's on sale online for $250,000. Next, good progress continues to be made with our e-com mobile and digital efforts. No big enhancements and changes to the site leading up to the holiday, mostly holiday prep. We did have 100% site availability during Cyber week, and sales for the five Cyber Days, Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Cyber Monday were up year-over-year in the mid-teens. Our app downloads during the quarter were 2.75 million, so total app downloads are now stand at 30.5 million or a 10% increase during the quarter, and that's after up being over 40% increase in all of fiscal '23 versus the prior year. Our site traffic approaching 0.5 billion and just under 10% increase and the average order value being up about 2.5%. So we continue to make progress there. Next couple of comments regarding inflation, most recently in the last fourth quarter discussion. We had estimated that year-over-year inflation was in the 1% to 2% range. Our estimate for the quarter just ended, that inflation was in the 0% to 1% range. Bigger deflation in some big and bulky items like furniture sets due to lower freight costs year-over-year as well as on things like domestics, bulky, lower priced items again, where the freight cost is significant. Some deflationary items were as much as 20% to 30% and again, mostly freight-related. TVs, the average sale prices have been lower while unit's been higher. And talking to the buyers overall, our inventories and our SKU counts are in good shape across all channels. And so far, we've had a good seasonal sell-through during the quarter. Lastly, as you saw in this afternoon's press release, we declared a $15 per share special cash dividend. This is our fifth special dividend in 11 years. The total payout will be about just under $6.7 billion and will be funded using existing cash and not accompanied by any issuance of debt. The special cash dividend will be paid on January 12th to shareholders of record on December 28th. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our December sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, December 31, on Thursday, January 4th, after market close. With that, I will turn it back for Q&A to Lisa and be happy to answer any questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Good evening. Thank you so much for taking my question. You had indicated over the last 1.5 years or so that Costco had been raising prices faster than it had throughout its history. So now with prices coming down, what is going to be the posture on passing along those savings? You already noted that inflation is flat to up 1%. So do you expect deflation, especially on the food side as you get through the next couple of quarters?\nRichard Galanti: Well, talking to buyers, we've seen that even during the quarter, we saw a trend towards that 0% versus the 1%. But at the end of the day, we don't -- the buyers are looking out three to six months. They have -- on the fresh food side, commodities-wise, they haven't seen a lot. There are a few things that are up and a few things are down, but no giant trend either way. Look, as you know us for a long time, we want to be the first to lower prices. We're out there pressing our vendors as we seek different commodity components come down and certainly on the non-food side, as we saw shipping costs come down, things like that. And so probably a little more than less, but we'll have to wait and see. We don't know.\nMichael Lasser: And my follow-up is another point that you've made for a long time is that Costco's going to draft off the profitability of the broader retail sector. If you compare Costco's operating margin over the last 12 months versus where it was prior to the pandemic, it's 300 to 400 basis points higher. And yet, across retail, there are signs that profitability is coming down. So now, what we've seen in the ways of Costco either maintaining this existing rate of operating profit margin or even further growing it from here, so it just simply going to be a function of your ability to drive further sales growth in the -- consistently mid-single digit range or better.\nRichard Galanti: Sure. Well, happily, I'm able to say that, that's -- you get to figure that one out. At the end of the day, we're -- as you've known for a long time, we're a top line company, we want to drive sales. Certainly, as there's been deflation in certain products, we've seen units go up. I'm looking at one example here just in the last month, $100 million plus of KS net items where sales were flat to down a couple percent, while units were up in the mid-teens, that takes a little more labor to do. But at the end of the day, that's what we want to do. We want to drive people and frequency. I think as long as we see renewal rates continue to do what they do, as long as we see new sign-ups continue to what they do and hopefully continue to get people to convert to Executive as well and constantly driving the best value out there, we'll be in good stead. And so far, we've been able to do that and I think we'll continue to be able to do that.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you very much and have a good holiday.\nRichard Galanti: You too.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nJacquelyn Sussman: Hi, there. This is Jackie Sussman on for Simeon. Thank you so much for taking our question. The core and core margin was up modestly this quarter and it seems like it moderated sequentially. Looking forward to the balance of the year, it seems like the comparison gets a bit tougher. I guess how should we think about your core and core margin? Could it stay expanding and positive for the rest of the year or any color on that would be helpful. Thank you so much.\nRichard Galanti: There are so many different moving parts to it. As you've heard me say and I say in the last several years, we want to drive top line first. We're also pragmatic. We want -- we recognize we're a for-profit company and we'll continue to work hard to do both. I wouldn't read much into any number going up a little or down a little, frankly. It fluctuates and there's lots of different components to it.\nJacquelyn Sussman: Got you. Thanks so much. And just a quick follow-up. Was the Black Friday and Cyber Monday gains that you had better than what you were expecting internally? Thanks so much.\nRichard Galanti: They\u2019re a little better than we were expecting but we were ready for it.\nJacquelyn Sussman: Thanks so much.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.\nCharles Grom: Hey. How is it going Richard? Good afternoon. I wanted to just dive into the core margins a little bit more and see if you could flesh out some of the category color. If you said it, I missed it, but food, sundries, fresh and on the hardlines parts of the business.\nRichard Galanti: Well, without giving you specific basis points, food and sundries was slightly down, very slightly down. Non-food was actually up. Some of that relates to the fact that we are comparing against last year when we had higher freight costs and trying to drive business and fresh was down a little bit. So nothing Earth-shattering in either of those directions.\nCharles Grom: Okay. And then on the ancillary up 22 basis points, I think we all get the gas component. But can you just talk about why the e-commerce margins were so much better in the quarter?\nRichard Galanti: I think, well, first of all, part of just ancillary in general is a sales penetration issue. Without going into it that the fact that it showed more -- sometimes when you look back over the quarters, they go in opposite directions, the core on core and then the other businesses. And so given that you had higher sales penetration in both and e-com, that helped you, and e-com, we had a lot of strength. We're doing a lot of big and bulky and we're driving that business.\nCharles Grom: Okay. Great. And then just bigger picture, I just have a question on the change at the CEO seat with Ron starting in a few weeks and replacing Craig, who replaced Jim. You've had the fortunate opportunity to work with all three. And I guess I'm curious what change, if any, you think we could see from an operating standpoint moving forward?\nRichard Galanti: Yeah. Well, I always joke I'm up for review so I'm going to say nice things. But at the end of the day, the reality is, we're staying the course. I remember questions were asked 12-plus years ago when Craig became President, and two years later, Jim retired and Craig became CEO and President. And what's -- who can replace Jim? And I think the same questions asked today, who could replace Greg? And it really is a seamless transition. You have somebody retiring that's been here 40-ish years and it's been in the business both on operations and merchandising for a successful number of years in both. And you've got Ron who's coming in, who started when he was 17 at a Price Club in Arizona. And he already has his 40-year gold patch. And again, 30-ish years in operations, a year in real estate traveling in the world and then six or seven years in merchandising. So I think it is pretty seamless. And to see them, the two of them work together over the last two years, almost two years since Ron became President, it's very similar to what I saw during those two years when Craig became President, and then two years later, Jim retired and Craig took on the CEO role as well. And so that's pretty much steady as she goes.\nCharles Grom: Got you. Great. Happy holidays. Thanks.\nRichard Galanti: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital.\nScott Mushkin: Hey, Richard. I guess, I just wanted to think about the potential clubs in the U.S. I know it comes up sometimes, but obviously, you added eight. It just seems like there's maybe more runway you can hear in the U.S. And I wonder if you have any thoughts on that. And then I had a quick follow-up.\nRichard Galanti: Sure. Well, if we were to open the 31 this year, that would be somewhere in the low 20s, the 23, 24 in the U.S. And I recognize a few of those are business centers, which is we continue to add as well as regular -- most of the regular warehouses. And I would say that, yes, I guess the story I'd share with you is six or eight years ago when it was roughly 60-40 or 70-30 U.S.-Canada versus the international -- other international. We were asked, what would it be by today? I'd say, well, by today, it will be 50-50. Well, today, you're asking the same question, it's 60-40 or 70-30 today, what will it be? And I think it will trend that way over time, but we are finding more opportunities in the U.S. Clearly, our average sales volume per location is higher today than we would have expected ourselves thankfully, six, seven years ago, what would it be by now. And we are finding those opportunities. So I view that as good news. We still -- we've got a lot of things going on to drive International, but International will be 6 or 7 units this year. And then opportunity to grow last year, international was -- is 9 or 10 and that's more of a timing issue.\nScott Mushkin: So then my follow-up is around traffic and also like the growth you had in appliances and TVs. You're just kind of going in a different direction than a lot of people. So what's driving the share gains in those categories? But also, are you guys doing anything specifically different to drive the traffic numbers you're seeing? Because I mean, they're pretty amazing, given the environment.\nRichard Galanti: Yeah. Well, look, I've always said I think the biggest attribute of value is the lowest price, given quantity and quality of good or service and then certainly add to that the trust that our members have. I think as it relates to specific things like I pointed out, like appliances and even tires, its value. We -- and the -- and having acquired Interval three or four years ago now called Costco Logistics, we're doing a lot of business there. And I think we've gotten a better job of communicating what the value is, not just showing what the price of the exact item is at some of the other big retail competitors on some of these big items. But then you add in delivery, take away the old product used, the installation, delivery, take away the old product for disposition, it\u2019s significant savings. Go do a price check of some of those things compared to our competition, that\u2019s where you\u2019ll see the strength.\nScott Mushkin: Perfect. Thanks.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.\nJohn Heinbockel: So Richard, I'm wondering if one of the things you may do differently here, we've talked about this before is leaning into personalization more and where you are on that journey, particularly with Ron coming in.\nRichard Galanti: Right. Well, we're -- first to our business was fixing the foundation. We're in the middle of re-platforming our e-commerce. It's not a big bank where we're going to put the switch one day, we're bringing things over and that's in progress. It was, I think I mentioned last -- probably last quarter, it's a two-year road map on that, and we're halfway through that. And so I'd say very little so far. If we're in the second inning, maybe we're in the third inning now. But we -- a lot of the focus has been on, first of all, making sure doing small improvements. We certainly got the -- on the 5 star rating, it got up north of 4.5 on that, and we're getting better at the site every time. But I think you would see personalization and, first of all, targeting and then personalization more over the next couple of years, honestly. And we're fine with that. We're the first to our business getting the foundation right. And we've made a lot of progress. I didn't spend a lot of time on this call talking about the new things, the enhancements we've made to the mobile site and the e-com site, but we've done a lot.\nJohn Heinbockel: And maybe as a follow-up, you talked about the international opportunity and it's still very well underdeveloped. So what's the hindrance to getting to -- because you're in a lot of countries now, 15 to 20 annual openings, maybe that's a big ask. But is it just quality of real estate because I would imagine operationally, it's not a human resource issue. Is it purely a real estate issue?\nRichard Galanti: I would say it's a combination of issues. In some countries, I mean, if you look at Korea, Taiwan, where we have whatever, 15 or 16 locations in each country, very successful. It's a little harder to find the next location just from a real estate standpoint. We -- if you look in Japan where we have plenty of future opportunity, we've got 30-plus now. And -- but again, it's a little bit of real estate. If you look at places like China or Spain, one of the challenges is you want -- you like to be able to ideally bring over more than a handful of people from the existing locations in the new one. It's a very hands-on operation. I think one of the things that we felt we mentioned that we had success when we first opened our first unit in Shanghai is we had at least 60, 70 people move there from Taiwan for promotions and for interactions, not just in the office and the buying offices, but even in the key supervisor and manager positions within the warehouse. And so it takes a little longer. And -- but we're working hard at it but it's a very hands-on experience.\nJohn Heinbockel: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.\nKelly Bania: Hello, Richard. Thanks for taking our questions. Just wanted to kind of follow up on Scot's question. I think your average sales per club in the U.S. and Canada is around $300 million at this point. And just curious on the status of how many clubs are doing kind of well over that and are maybe in some need of relief in the form of self-cannibalization and more clubs nearby. And a follow-up as well on International. Just as we think about the next maybe three to five years, are there any countries that might be disproportionately getting more of the growth here?\nRichard Galanti: Okay. What was the first part of the question, again?\nUnidentified Company Representative: The average sales.\nRichard Galanti: Average sales. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I know in fiscal '23, we had something like 25 or so locations that did over $400 million and another 160 or so that did $300 million to $400 million. Those are huge numbers. And certainly, as we get 350-plus and one of them, by the way, they did over 400 did a few million over $600 million. And so generally, when it starts getting -- when it starts having a three in front of it, certainly at $350 million, we want to start looking to see what we can do to cannibalize it, frankly, and to have more growth in that market. And so hopefully, that's our -- one of our bigger problems and challenges that we have more of those each year. So I think that will continue. Again, if I look back five, eight years ago, even assuming whatever inflation number you want to assume, I think we've done a little better than that in terms of the sales volumes. And so that's good news for us that we'll continue to do that. Internationally, again, I'm just looking at the map of where we are. Certainly, we only have four locations in Spain. We've actually added a few on a base of 30-plus in the U.K. We think we have more opportunity in Mexico. In Japan, where we have something in the low 30s, certainly, it's done well there, and there's many more markets and population there that we can go to. Australia is, whatever two-thirds -- a little under two-thirds of the size of Canada where we have 105 or so locations. And in Australia, we have 15. I'm not suggesting we're going to have two-thirds of 105 there anytime soon. It takes us 35-plus years to get there in Canada. But we think that those are the opportunities. It's not like we're looking for a lot of other new countries at this juncture. We've done a few new countries, those single locations like in Sweden and Iceland and Auckland all being somewhat managed buying wise somewhat operationally by host country in the case of Scandinavia by the U.K., in the case of Auckland by Australia.\nKelly Bania: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good afternoon, guys. So Richard, last quarter, you talked a bit about Costco Next. And I guess my question is, how big of an impact is that program having on your e-com sales at this point, number one? Number two, kind of related to that, any change in your betting of what vendors operate on that program, just thinking about the quality control aspect? Thank you.\nRichard Galanti: Well, first of all, it's still very small relative to our company. And the fact is, is that the Costco net sales currently are not in our sales. It's -- we got to commission, so it's kind of like 3P, if you will, 3P sales. And at some juncture, some of their rules -- accounting rules where you can include it in sales based on what risk and what ownership level you have in the items. But at this juncture, those sales, it's more of the market value and just the commission in our number. In terms of how we vet, we do it the same way we vet items. We want items that make sense to provide value, and we have a team that is here that are vetting every -- each and every one of those. I think we're up to about 70 -- about 65 current suppliers on there and we'll certainly have many more as we go forward.\nScot Ciccarelli: So presumably, if that program keeps growing, should that be a natural gross margin driver for you over time? I know it's small now, but if you're just collecting the commission, presumably that's kind of 100% margin, right?\nRichard Galanti: Essentially, yes. Much like the travel business.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. Thank you.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Mostly.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.\nGregory Melich: Hi, thanks. Richard, I want to follow up on the membership fee hike as I think now we're in extra time. And I wonder how much does the growth in mix and Executive membership driving that high single-digit growth. Is that what it means that you don't have to increase it and you could keep waiting or is there something else?\nRichard Galanti: I think it's just us. Again, if I look at the -- if you ask the question, what are the variables we would look at, we would want to look at strong renewal rates, strong new sign-ups, strong loyalty, and we have all that. So I think it's a question is, we haven't needed to do it. We like providing extreme value. Certainly, while we've gone a little longer than the average increase, we feel we certainly have driven more value to the membership. So I'll use my standby answer, my answer, it's a question of when, not if. But at this juncture, we feel pretty good about what we're doing.\nGregory Melich: And a follow-up on inflation. I just want to make sure I got that right. You said 0% to 1% for the quarter. Did it trend towards 0%? Did we exit near the bottom? And you mentioned some categories that were deflationary, which ones are stubborn in terms of inflation where it's hardest to get it out?\nRichard Galanti: Which inflation -- which categories are stubborn in inflation?\nGregory Melich: Yeah. Where you can\u2019t get that?\nRichard Galanti: CPG, obviously.\nGregory Melich: All the branded packaged stuff?\nRichard Galanti: There wasn't a big trend. I think at the end, it was a little lower than the beginning, but not a big trend.\nGregory Melich: Okay. So it's not like we exited 0%. We're still slightly positive.\nRichard Galanti: Right. But recognize, the LIFO charge is an inventory cost of sales charge. [Multiple Speakers]\nUnidentified Company Representative: Year-over-year number. LIFO [Multiple Speakers]\nRichard Galanti: Right. The 0% to 1% is from the beginning of the fiscal year. Now it's from -- I'm sorry, the beginning of -- the 0% to 1% is versus a year ago.\nGregory Melich: Year-over-year, got it.\nRichard Galanti: Yeah.\nGregory Melich: Great. And then just last, what is the auto renewal rate now?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Around 60%.\nRichard Galanti: In the U.S., it's around 60%.\nGregory Melich: Perfect. Thanks. Have a great holiday guys.\nRichard Galanti: You too.\nOperator: We'll take a next question from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.\nRupesh Parikh: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So I just want to go to operating expense growth. So operating expense growth is still high. Would you expect the growth rate to moderate once you lap that March wage increase? And then anything unusual within that line item that's still driving pretty high growth?\nRichard Galanti: There's not a lot unusual. I think it gets back to the question of low inflation, which creates a little bit more of a challenge, right? My extreme -- and again, that was a very extreme example I gave you on nuts. But when you had a slight 0% to 2% decline in sales and a 14% increase in units, you got more labor involved, more hours stock of the shelf. I mean that's at the 40,000-foot level. And that's an extreme example. But I think overall, it is sales base. You should also remember, if you remember going back to fiscal '19 and the first part of fiscal '20, before COVID, our SG&A percent was -- for all of \u201819, it was at 10 04. In the first quarter of 2020, it was a 10 34, And for the whole year, it was a 10 04 for both of those two years. And we used to think to ourselves will we ever be able to get it back below 10%. And in 2022, which was the kind of month seven through 18, if you will, that 12-month period after that full fiscal year for us of COVID, we reported an 8 88 for that year. So even at the 9 45 that we just reported, we're still quite a bit lower than we had been historically, a function of a lot of things, including higher sales productivity and all that. So I think we're doing pretty well. I think certainly, that's the challenge. How do we reduce that and how do we manage that? And certainly, the biggest way to manage is driving more sales.\nRupesh Parikh: Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. So just curious how you're feeling about the healthier consumer. So it was interesting to hear that TVs did well this past quarter.\nRichard Galanti: Look, I think when we're asked that question, we're fortunate to answer it that we're, first of all, looking at the consumer through somewhat rose-colored glasses here. The we have enjoyed great value. And again, we're convinced it's value. We've got -- I think on the margin, there's a few extra things that we've done. We've improved the site of the website. We've gotten a little better communicating stuff, not completely. But I think overall, it's -- and we've been good merchants. I think the merchants have done a great job of bringing in new stuff. And not being shy when we see an industry category down a lot, that we can still -- if we're driving people in, we've got a better chance of getting them to buy something.\nRupesh Parikh: Thank you. Happy holidays.\nRichard Galanti: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Oliver Chen with TD Cowen.\nThomas Nass: Hi. This is Tom Nass on for Oliver. Just a quick question on the trend of Kirkland relative to last year. If you could just remind us how that's trending maybe across categories. And then if you have any notable callouts, any recent innovations? Just curious if this is essentially driving any efficiencies and supplier negotiations that can position Costco for stronger gross margin ahead.\nRichard Galanti: Well, I would say, allowing us to get better deals, which means lower prices. But look, I think we -- Kirkland signature (ph) relative to non-gas sales is in the high-20s. And I think it was probably a good year ago when inflation was in the 8 and 9 range, if you will, if you remember. And we talked about that year-over-year, we saw probably the biggest increased penetration of KS at Costco. It was 1, 1.5 percentage points, when historically, it has been 25 basis points to 50 basis points a year. I think we're back to that, but we've maintained that higher level and we're back to seeing smaller increases in penetration every year, but nonetheless still driving that business. But we've got -- yeah. I think that helps with some of the deflationary certainly with KS stuff, we're closer to the supplier. We're not the only -- we're the only customer buying that item and we can drive a little bit more business. So I think it just continues to work that way for us.\nThomas Nass: Great. And then just a quick follow-up on any notable behavioral trends you've seen in consumer shopping this holiday season?\nRichard Galanti: Some colleague in my room said they're buying gold. But no, that's actually online mostly. But no, I think -- again, I think the traffic thing is the thing that we're happily surprised about that we're continuing to drive people in on an increasing basis. We know we benefited during those, call it those two years, kind of March, April of '20 to March, April of '22, the kind of the two years of COVID, we benefited in many ways from more members and more volumes. And we\u2019ve not only kept it, we\u2019re continuing now to add to those levels, so we feel very fortunate in that regard.\nThomas Nass: Thanks.\nRichard Galanti: One of my colleagues here just mentioned that discretionary merchandise trends are getting a little better. And that\u2019s not only on big ticket but in general, nonfood stuff. I think that corresponds with my comment earlier that we feel good about the seasonal -- how we\u2019ve done seasonally.\nThomas Nass: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: Yes. Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. I guess I wanted to ask on the Kirkland products, specifically maybe on the CPG that you mentioned. How has pricing or how has prices trended on those versus the branded products? Have you seen any deviation there, given you're closer? Are you able to lower prices? I suppose to the extent that, that has happened, do you notice any more market share changes within those CPG categories?\nRichard Galanti: I think it's slightly -- it's deflationary. It's a little more deflationary in the KS than in the CPG, which drives more value to KS, frankly. But we're seeing some -- our ability to work with our CPG suppliers as well, but just a little stronger ability to do that with KS.\nMark Astrachan: Got it.\nRichard Galanti: And it is, again, a comment in the room here. We've had -- it's allowed us to do some new item introductions on the KS side as well.\nMark Astrachan: Great. And then just following up on the last question. Anything you can call out amongst the newer memberships cohorts in terms of renewal rates versus the average?\nRichard Galanti: Generally speaking, if you compare, everybody was always concerned. I remember 10-plus years ago, people would ask you, how are you going after millennials? And then it's how you go after the next gen or whatever, the Gen Zs or whatever? At the end of the day, when we look at the different cohorts, if you just change the names, the curve seems to be about the same in terms of getting new younger members. They buy less, they buy more as they get older into that 40- to 55-year-old sweet spot. I don\u2019t know in terms of renewal rates. I think the rates are \u2013 our overall rates are improving so I think we\u2019re probably doing a better job there. Certainly, things like, frankly, auto renewal helped that as well.\nMark Astrachan: Got it. Thank you. Happy holidays.\nRichard Galanti: Same to you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies.\nCorey Tarlowe: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. Richard, you mentioned about the wage increases that you've taken recently. I'm curious to get your thoughts about the wage increases that you've taken within the context of now the lower inflation that you're seeing as well as what could be potential deflation further ahead. So curious about the ability for Costco to maybe maintain a more nimble margin structure amid what could be some volatility on the pricing side.\nRichard Galanti: Frankly, we look at the wages in a vacuum, and we want to do as much as we can for our employees. And certainly, there were several increases starting with the frontline worker premium during the initial year of COVID. We kept half of that in there, which we kept $1 of those $2 now in there, which was like $400 million a year. Again, we've also benefited from stronger sales and productivity so we're able to afford that. But we look at them independently and we'll continue to do that to look at it. To the extent inflationary pressures are down, that means there's probably a little less inflationary pressure on wages. But we give -- over half of our employees are top of scale and they're getting increases irrespective of some of the extra things we talked about every March. And then as you go from a new employee over the first 9,000 or 10,000 hours, you're getting constant increases that are more -- significantly more.\nCorey Tarlowe: Understood. And then just piggybacking off of that, and I understand it may be difficult to attribute a cause and effect relationship to this. But do you think that perhaps the moderating inflation that we've seen in the need-based categories like fresh and food and sundries may have unlocked a little bit of extra wallet to spend in the non-food category? And they have driven some of the momentum that you've seen in categories like TVs and others?\nRichard Galanti: I think it can't hurt even with gas prices have come down a little bit. That's top of mind every week when somebody fills up their tank. So those things help. I think I'm sure on a macro basis, that's the case but it's a guess on our part.\nCorey Tarlowe: Understood. Great. Thank you very much and best of luck.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Dean Rosenblum with Bernstein.\nDean Rosenblum: Hey, Richard, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. There's really two big debates that clients are asking us about. First one is on gross margins, and in particular, the potential for a gross margin impact from mix shift back toward things like appliances and TVs, which are notoriously lower gross margin, at least in the marketplace versus fresh and food and sundries. As you see the sort of big ticket discretionary starting to come back a little bit, do you expect any overall impact on gross margins from that mix shift away from food and sundries to big ticket discretionary?\nRichard Galanti: First of all, our margin range is so much more compacted than traditional retail, different categories of traditional retail. I mean, if you think about it, we have, what, 12%, 13% gross margin, 11%. I'm thinking markup, and in theory, it ranges from 0% to 15%. In reality, it's -- there's very few things that are below 5% and a lot of things hover around the 8% to 12% range. And so I don't think it's as big of an impact to us in terms of those mix changes. And I got to say it's always all saying it's always something. There's always something that hurts you and there's another thing that helps you. And it's a really -- it's a mixture.\nDean Rosenblum: True. And then the other big debate that's contrasting about is the relative profitability of new stores versus existing stores. There's sort of two themes there. One is new U.S. versus existing U.S. and then the relative profitability of new stores internationally. I was wondering if you could speak to that a bit.\nRichard Galanti: Well, first of all, when you look at like at an ROI, the eye on the denominator on an older building is a lower eye (ph). If 10 years ago, the typical building in the United States property equipment and building fixtures, I'm shooting from the hip here, was $30 million to $35 million and now it's $45 million to $50 million. So you've got a different eye. But generally speaking, when we look at the ROI of each of our eight U.S. regions, our two Canadian regions, new units come in, start a little lower and get up there over time. You'll have some outliers because of some units that are 30- and 40-years-old even with eye (ph) increase because we expanded the unit and upgraded it and remodeled it. The fact of the matter is the higher volume is really shine through there. On an international standpoint, we've always, I think, talked about the fact that there's a few different things that the ROIs in some of these other countries tend to be a little higher. The return on sales tends to be even more -- even higher than that in some of these countries because a combination very little related to gross margin, some related to membership fees, some related to wages and some related to benefits, health benefits. U.S. health care costs dwarf every other country that we're in.\nDean Rosenblum: Got it. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Good holidays and thanks for the pie.\nRichard Galanti: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.\nJoseph Feldman: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to first ask on Executive member penetration seems like it continues to inch higher. And I was just wondering how you guys think about that. And like how high should that be? I mean presumably, you want everybody to be an Executive member. But is there like kind of a natural level where you think it can still go from here beyond the 46%?\nRichard Galanti: I think -- well, there's always going to be another country or two we add. You need a certain number. In our view, we've always done it after there's 15 or so warehouses in the country. So that will add to it a little bit. But no, I think some of the increase -- it's kind of like getting up to that asymptotic line when you -- one of the things that drove it in the last few years, one, we've done a better job in the last several years of selling it to you as well as auto renewal. When people come in now or sign up online, they're signing up to they want to put their credit or debit card in there and they can opt in to doing it online -- doing other renewal. So I think those things have pushed it along with us being so wonderful. But I think you'll still see it come up a little bit but probably that rate of increase will slow over time.\nJoseph Feldman: Got it. Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. Anything to talk about on shrink because I know that there was an issue with shrink even for you guys at one point. And I know you guys have cracked down on making sure members are showing their cards when they walk in the store. And obviously, when you leave with your goods, you're checking your receipts. But anything we should think about with regard to shrink going forward and recent trends?\nRichard Galanti: Thankfully, nothing at all. It's really -- I think what we already talked about was a combination of, as we went into some self-check out over the last several years and then perhaps more recent things that you read about in the paper, we get less impacted by the latter as well. Maybe we saw a couple of basis point delta upward on a very low number of basis points to start with. So we're fortunate in that regard.\nJoseph Feldman: Got it. Thank you and happy holidays, guys.\nRichard Galanti: Same to you. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Laura Champine with Loop Capital.\nLaura Champine: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig in a little bit more into some of those numbers on the column. The ancillary profit improvement, I think that's where you're -- I'm just wondering what drove that. And on the operations line, it sounds like that pressure in SG&A didn't come mostly from wages and I'm wondering where it did come from.\nRichard Galanti: Yes. On the ancillary line, it's gas and e-com and it's a combination of increased sales penetration and increased margins within those businesses. The thing about gas is I think everybody out there that has gas stations, what we have found is we've been able to see improved profitability not just in the last quarter or two, but over the last few years -- last three to five years, improved profitability in gas because others are making more, and we're allowed to make a little more. When we do our competitive price shops on gas, which we do weekly at every gas stations, we operate with our neighboring competitive gas stations. On the e-comm side, I think driving more sales has helped us in the margins there as well.\nLaura Champine: Thanks. And then just on the operations...\nRichard Galanti: Yeah. On the wages, while we pointed out \u2013 I pointed out on the call, I think there was like four or so basis points in total from those two distinct increases, we do other increases like over half of our employees are top of scale. They get an increase every March that\u2019s significant as well, significant relative to basis points. When you have lower sales figures. I mean, and \u2013 the rest of it is all the other lines like energy costs and the like.\nLaura Champine: Got it. So most of the pressure is probably coming from wages, not just those two discrete callouts you had?\nRichard Galanti: It\u2019s more than half. I don\u2019t have the exact figures with me.\nQ \u2013 Laura Champine: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Richard Galanti for any additional or closing remarks.\nRichard Galanti: Well, thank you, Lisa, and thank you, everyone on the call. We\u2019re around to answer questions and have a happy holiday. And I think this is a record time of finishing this call. So enjoy the holidays. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude the presentation. Thank you for your participation today, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Richard Galanti",
            "content": "Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. Comparable sales and comparable sales excluding impacts from changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange are intended as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP. In today's release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal '24, the 12 weeks ended November 26. Reported net income for the 12-week first quarter came in at $1.589 billion or $3.58 per share, up from $1.364 billion or $3.07 per share in the 12-week first quarter last year. This year's results included a tax benefit of $44 million or $0.10 a share related to stock-based compensation. Last year's results included a tax benefit of $53 million or $0.12 per share related to stock-based compensation and also included a charge of $93 million pre-tax or $0.15 per share primarily related to downsizing our charter shipping activities. Net sales for the first quarter were $56.72 billion, a 6.1% increase over last year's first quarter, $53.44 billion. Net sales were benefited by approximately 0.5% (ph) to 1% in the U.S. and worldwide from the shift of the fiscal calendar as a result of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023. The following comparable sales reflect comparable locations year-over-year and comparable retail weeks. In the U.S. reported 2% comp sales ex-gas deflation and FX 2.6%. Canada reported 6.4%, ex-gas and FX 8.2%. Other International reported 11.2%, ex-gas and FX 7.1%. For total company reported 3.8% and at 3.9%, excluding those two items. E-commerce, which was reported as a 6.3% came in at 6.1% excluding FX. Overall, for the first fiscal quarter, fresh foods were relatively strong once again, with food and sundries right behind. Non-food showed improvement over the September October, November time frame as did e-com sales. In terms of Q1 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 4.7% worldwide and 3.6% in the United States. Our average transaction was down 0.9% worldwide and down 1.6% in the U.S. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted sales by approximately 0.4%, while gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 0.6%. I've gotten more than a few calls in the past few weeks as to how many pies we sold in the U.S. leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday. In the U.S., in the three days leading up to Thanksgiving, we sold 2.9 million of our famous Pumpkin Pies along with 1.3 million apple and pecan pies, so over 4 million pies in total during the three days. Back to the income statement here and next on the income statement's membership fee income. In the quarter, we reported $1.082 billion or 1.91%, that's an $82 million or 8.2% increase and a 4 basis point increase over the first quarter last year. In terms of renewal rates, at first quarter end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate stood at 92.8%, while the worldwide rate came in at 90.5%. Both of these rates were up 0.1% from those numbers 12 weeks earlier at the end of the fourth quarter. Membership growth continues. We ended Q1 with 72.0 million paid household members, up 7.6% versus last year and 129.5 million cardholders, up 7.1%, with consistent growth throughout the quarters. At Q1 end, we had 33.2 million paid Executive members, an increase of 939,000 during the 12 weeks since Q4 end. Executive members now represent a little over 46% of our paid members and a little over 73% of worldwide sales. Moving down the income statement next is, our gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was higher year-over-year by 43 basis points, coming in at 11.04%, up from Q1 of last year at 10.61%. That 43 basis point reported number ex-gas deflation would be plus 36 basis points. As I normally do here, we write down two columns and six line items. The first column is reported in the first quarter. The second column is margins, excluding gas deflation. It's the year-over-year change in the first quarter. On a core merchandise, plus 3 basis points reported, minus 3 basis points ex-deflation. Ancillary and other businesses, plus 24% reported and plus 22% ex-gas deflation; 2% reward lower year-over-year, minus 4 basis points reported and minus 3 ex-gas deflation; LIFO, plus 3 and plus 3 and other plus 17 and plus 17 for a total, again, reported year-over-year up 43 basis points and ex-gas deflation up 36 basis points. Starting with the core. Again, it was total company, it was plus 3 and minus 3 reported and ex-gas deflation. In terms of core margin on their own sales, our core-on-core margins were up by 5 basis points year-over-year. Ancillary and other business gross margin, again, higher by 24 and higher by 22 ex-gas deflation. This increase was driven largely by gas and e-comm. Our 2% reward higher by 4 and higher by 3 ex-deflation, reflecting higher sales penetration coming from our Executive members. LIFO plus 3 basis points. We had a $15 million LIFO credit in the first quarter of this year. This compared to a very small $0.5 million LIFO charge in Q1 a year ago. And then, the other line item, the 17 basis points to the positive. As was mentioned earlier, last year in Q1, there was a 17 basis point impact from a $93 million pre-tax charge, primarily related -- primarily for the downsizing of our charter shipping activities. Moving on to SG&A. We reported SG&A of 9.45%, higher by 25 basis points than last year's 9.20%. Again, in Q1, we're right down the two columns. Reported and without gas deflation, operations, minus 18 and minus 14 basis points, minus being -- meaning it's higher year-over-year. Central minus 2 and minus 1. Stock compensation minus 3 and minus 2. Pre-opening expense, minus 2 and minus 2, again, for a total reported margin higher minus 25% year-over-year. I'm sorry, SG&A, not margin, 25 and without gas deflation, higher by 19 basis points. The quarter again was higher by 18 and higher by 14, excluding the impact from gas. This included 12 weeks of this past March's extra top of scale increase in our wages, which represents an estimated 2 basis point hit. And as of September 18, we raised the starting wage in the U.S. and Canada, that estimated impact from those new wages to be roughly 2 basis points as well. Again, central, nothing much to say other than its 1 basis point higher, excluding gas deflation. Again, it was stock comp's, the minus 2x gas deflation and pre-opening. We did have a couple of more openings this year in the quarter than we did last year and that was higher by 2 basis points. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $38 million this year, $4 million higher than last year's $34 million figure. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $107 million, coming in at $160 million this year versus $53 million last year. This was driven largely by the increase in interest income, about $100 million of that $107 million due to higher interest rates as well as high cash balances. The small additional impact was a favorable FX year-over-year. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the first quarter was 24.5%. This compares to 23.0% a year ago or 1.5 percentage points higher this year than last year. The increase in our rate as of Q1 -- in Q1 is primarily attributable to lower benefit from the stock-based compensation from a year ago. Overall, reported net income was up 16.5% year-over-year in the quarter. A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion in the first quarter, we opened 10 locations, including one relo (ph), so a net of nine increases. That -- those nine included eight in the U.S. and one in Canada. For the full year fiscal '24, we estimate opening -- we're planning to open 33 locations, including two relos, so for a net increase of 31 new warehouses that would be up from 23 that we opened in fiscal '23. For Q2 fiscal '24, we plan four new locations, including our sixth building in China, are early in the calendar year. Regarding capital expenditures, first quarter capital expenditure spend was approximately $1.04 billion. We estimate that fiscal '24 CapEx will be in the $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion range, that's up from $4.3 billion we had in fiscal '23, reflecting a continued increase in the number of the expansion that we're doing. In terms of e-commerce business, e-com sales in Q1 ex-FX increased 6.1%, the first quarterly year-over-year increase in five fiscal quarters and trended well during the three reporting periods of September, October, November. E-comm showed strength in several areas. In food, things like e-gift cards, pet items, snack items were up in the mid-teens. Appliances were up year-over-year in the mid-20s. TVs was actually in the high-singles despite the challenges with other aspects of consumer electronics like computers, and tires were up in the low-teens. So overall, a pretty good showing there. As well, Costco Logistics enjoyed record-breaking deliveries. In the first quarter of fiscal '24, we completed over 800,000 deliveries, which were up 17% versus the comparable quarter last year. And some fun wow items in the quarter in e-commerce. You've probably read about the fact that we're selling gold 1 ounce gold bars. We sold over $100 million of gold during the quarter. We sold a Babe Ruth autographed index card for $20,000. And in addition to e-gift cards on everything from restaurants to golf to airlines, and we just in the last couple of weeks, launched a Disney e-gift card valued at $250 for $224.99. And for you last-minute shoppers out there, there is a Mickey Mantle autographed 1951 Rookie Card in nearly perfect condition and it's on sale online for $250,000. Next, good progress continues to be made with our e-com mobile and digital efforts. No big enhancements and changes to the site leading up to the holiday, mostly holiday prep. We did have 100% site availability during Cyber week, and sales for the five Cyber Days, Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Cyber Monday were up year-over-year in the mid-teens. Our app downloads during the quarter were 2.75 million, so total app downloads are now stand at 30.5 million or a 10% increase during the quarter, and that's after up being over 40% increase in all of fiscal '23 versus the prior year. Our site traffic approaching 0.5 billion and just under 10% increase and the average order value being up about 2.5%. So we continue to make progress there. Next couple of comments regarding inflation, most recently in the last fourth quarter discussion. We had estimated that year-over-year inflation was in the 1% to 2% range. Our estimate for the quarter just ended, that inflation was in the 0% to 1% range. Bigger deflation in some big and bulky items like furniture sets due to lower freight costs year-over-year as well as on things like domestics, bulky, lower priced items again, where the freight cost is significant. Some deflationary items were as much as 20% to 30% and again, mostly freight-related. TVs, the average sale prices have been lower while unit's been higher. And talking to the buyers overall, our inventories and our SKU counts are in good shape across all channels. And so far, we've had a good seasonal sell-through during the quarter. Lastly, as you saw in this afternoon's press release, we declared a $15 per share special cash dividend. This is our fifth special dividend in 11 years. The total payout will be about just under $6.7 billion and will be funded using existing cash and not accompanied by any issuance of debt. The special cash dividend will be paid on January 12th to shareholders of record on December 28th. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our December sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, December 31, on Thursday, January 4th, after market close. With that, I will turn it back for Q&A to Lisa and be happy to answer any questions. Well, talking to buyers, we've seen that even during the quarter, we saw a trend towards that 0% versus the 1%. But at the end of the day, we don't -- the buyers are looking out three to six months. They have -- on the fresh food side, commodities-wise, they haven't seen a lot. There are a few things that are up and a few things are down, but no giant trend either way. Look, as you know us for a long time, we want to be the first to lower prices. We're out there pressing our vendors as we seek different commodity components come down and certainly on the non-food side, as we saw shipping costs come down, things like that. And so probably a little more than less, but we'll have to wait and see. We don't know. Sure. Well, happily, I'm able to say that, that's -- you get to figure that one out. At the end of the day, we're -- as you've known for a long time, we're a top line company, we want to drive sales. Certainly, as there's been deflation in certain products, we've seen units go up. I'm looking at one example here just in the last month, $100 million plus of KS net items where sales were flat to down a couple percent, while units were up in the mid-teens, that takes a little more labor to do. But at the end of the day, that's what we want to do. We want to drive people and frequency. I think as long as we see renewal rates continue to do what they do, as long as we see new sign-ups continue to what they do and hopefully continue to get people to convert to Executive as well and constantly driving the best value out there, we'll be in good stead. And so far, we've been able to do that and I think we'll continue to be able to do that. You too. There are so many different moving parts to it. As you've heard me say and I say in the last several years, we want to drive top line first. We're also pragmatic. We want -- we recognize we're a for-profit company and we'll continue to work hard to do both. I wouldn't read much into any number going up a little or down a little, frankly. It fluctuates and there's lots of different components to it. They're a little better than we were expecting but we were ready for it. Well, without giving you specific basis points, food and sundries was slightly down, very slightly down. Non-food was actually up. Some of that relates to the fact that we are comparing against last year when we had higher freight costs and trying to drive business and fresh was down a little bit. So nothing Earth-shattering in either of those directions. I think, well, first of all, part of just ancillary in general is a sales penetration issue. Without going into it that the fact that it showed more -- sometimes when you look back over the quarters, they go in opposite directions, the core on core and then the other businesses. And so given that you had higher sales penetration in both and e-com, that helped you, and e-com, we had a lot of strength. We're doing a lot of big and bulky and we're driving that business. Yeah. Well, I always joke I'm up for review so I'm going to say nice things. But at the end of the day, the reality is, we're staying the course. I remember questions were asked 12-plus years ago when Craig became President, and two years later, Jim retired and Craig became CEO and President. And what's -- who can replace Jim? And I think the same questions asked today, who could replace Greg? And it really is a seamless transition. You have somebody retiring that's been here 40-ish years and it's been in the business both on operations and merchandising for a successful number of years in both. And you've got Ron who's coming in, who started when he was 17 at a Price Club in Arizona. And he already has his 40-year gold patch. And again, 30-ish years in operations, a year in real estate traveling in the world and then six or seven years in merchandising. So I think it is pretty seamless. And to see them, the two of them work together over the last two years, almost two years since Ron became President, it's very similar to what I saw during those two years when Craig became President, and then two years later, Jim retired and Craig took on the CEO role as well. And so that's pretty much steady as she goes. Thanks. Sure. Well, if we were to open the 31 this year, that would be somewhere in the low 20s, the 23, 24 in the U.S. And I recognize a few of those are business centers, which is we continue to add as well as regular -- most of the regular warehouses. And I would say that, yes, I guess the story I'd share with you is six or eight years ago when it was roughly 60-40 or 70-30 U.S.-Canada versus the international -- other international. We were asked, what would it be by today? I'd say, well, by today, it will be 50-50. Well, today, you're asking the same question, it's 60-40 or 70-30 today, what will it be? And I think it will trend that way over time, but we are finding more opportunities in the U.S. Clearly, our average sales volume per location is higher today than we would have expected ourselves thankfully, six, seven years ago, what would it be by now. And we are finding those opportunities. So I view that as good news. We still -- we've got a lot of things going on to drive International, but International will be 6 or 7 units this year. And then opportunity to grow last year, international was -- is 9 or 10 and that's more of a timing issue. Yeah. Well, look, I've always said I think the biggest attribute of value is the lowest price, given quantity and quality of good or service and then certainly add to that the trust that our members have. I think as it relates to specific things like I pointed out, like appliances and even tires, its value. We -- and the -- and having acquired Interval three or four years ago now called Costco Logistics, we're doing a lot of business there. And I think we've gotten a better job of communicating what the value is, not just showing what the price of the exact item is at some of the other big retail competitors on some of these big items. But then you add in delivery, take away the old product used, the installation, delivery, take away the old product for disposition, it's significant savings. Go do a price check of some of those things compared to our competition, that's where you'll see the strength. Right. Well, we're -- first to our business was fixing the foundation. We're in the middle of re-platforming our e-commerce. It's not a big bank where we're going to put the switch one day, we're bringing things over and that's in progress. It was, I think I mentioned last -- probably last quarter, it's a two-year road map on that, and we're halfway through that. And so I'd say very little so far. If we're in the second inning, maybe we're in the third inning now. But we -- a lot of the focus has been on, first of all, making sure doing small improvements. We certainly got the -- on the 5 star rating, it got up north of 4.5 on that, and we're getting better at the site every time. But I think you would see personalization and, first of all, targeting and then personalization more over the next couple of years, honestly. And we're fine with that. We're the first to our business getting the foundation right. And we've made a lot of progress. I didn't spend a lot of time on this call talking about the new things, the enhancements we've made to the mobile site and the e-com site, but we've done a lot. I would say it's a combination of issues. In some countries, I mean, if you look at Korea, Taiwan, where we have whatever, 15 or 16 locations in each country, very successful. It's a little harder to find the next location just from a real estate standpoint. We -- if you look in Japan where we have plenty of future opportunity, we've got 30-plus now. And -- but again, it's a little bit of real estate. If you look at places like China or Spain, one of the challenges is you want -- you like to be able to ideally bring over more than a handful of people from the existing locations in the new one. It's a very hands-on operation. I think one of the things that we felt we mentioned that we had success when we first opened our first unit in Shanghai is we had at least 60, 70 people move there from Taiwan for promotions and for interactions, not just in the office and the buying offices, but even in the key supervisor and manager positions within the warehouse. And so it takes a little longer. And -- but we're working hard at it but it's a very hands-on experience. Okay. What was the first part of the question, again? Average sales. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I know in fiscal '23, we had something like 25 or so locations that did over $400 million and another 160 or so that did $300 million to $400 million. Those are huge numbers. And certainly, as we get 350-plus and one of them, by the way, they did over 400 did a few million over $600 million. And so generally, when it starts getting -- when it starts having a three in front of it, certainly at $350 million, we want to start looking to see what we can do to cannibalize it, frankly, and to have more growth in that market. And so hopefully, that's our -- one of our bigger problems and challenges that we have more of those each year. So I think that will continue. Again, if I look back five, eight years ago, even assuming whatever inflation number you want to assume, I think we've done a little better than that in terms of the sales volumes. And so that's good news for us that we'll continue to do that. Internationally, again, I'm just looking at the map of where we are. Certainly, we only have four locations in Spain. We've actually added a few on a base of 30-plus in the U.K. We think we have more opportunity in Mexico. In Japan, where we have something in the low 30s, certainly, it's done well there, and there's many more markets and population there that we can go to. Australia is, whatever two-thirds -- a little under two-thirds of the size of Canada where we have 105 or so locations. And in Australia, we have 15. I'm not suggesting we're going to have two-thirds of 105 there anytime soon. It takes us 35-plus years to get there in Canada. But we think that those are the opportunities. It's not like we're looking for a lot of other new countries at this juncture. We've done a few new countries, those single locations like in Sweden and Iceland and Auckland all being somewhat managed buying wise somewhat operationally by host country in the case of Scandinavia by the U.K., in the case of Auckland by Australia. Well, first of all, it's still very small relative to our company. And the fact is, is that the Costco net sales currently are not in our sales. It's -- we got to commission, so it's kind of like 3P, if you will, 3P sales. And at some juncture, some of their rules -- accounting rules where you can include it in sales based on what risk and what ownership level you have in the items. But at this juncture, those sales, it's more of the market value and just the commission in our number. In terms of how we vet, we do it the same way we vet items. We want items that make sense to provide value, and we have a team that is here that are vetting every -- each and every one of those. I think we're up to about 70 -- about 65 current suppliers on there and we'll certainly have many more as we go forward. Essentially, yes. Much like the travel business. I think it's just us. Again, if I look at the -- if you ask the question, what are the variables we would look at, we would want to look at strong renewal rates, strong new sign-ups, strong loyalty, and we have all that. So I think it's a question is, we haven't needed to do it. We like providing extreme value. Certainly, while we've gone a little longer than the average increase, we feel we certainly have driven more value to the membership. So I'll use my standby answer, my answer, it's a question of when, not if. But at this juncture, we feel pretty good about what we're doing. Which inflation -- which categories are stubborn in inflation? CPG, obviously. There wasn't a big trend. I think at the end, it was a little lower than the beginning, but not a big trend. Right. But recognize, the LIFO charge is an inventory cost of sales charge. [Multiple Speakers] Right. The 0% to 1% is from the beginning of the fiscal year. Now it's from -- I'm sorry, the beginning of -- the 0% to 1% is versus a year ago. Yeah. In the U.S., it's around 60%. You too. There's not a lot unusual. I think it gets back to the question of low inflation, which creates a little bit more of a challenge, right? My extreme -- and again, that was a very extreme example I gave you on nuts. But when you had a slight 0% to 2% decline in sales and a 14% increase in units, you got more labor involved, more hours stock of the shelf. I mean that's at the 40,000-foot level. And that's an extreme example. But I think overall, it is sales base. You should also remember, if you remember going back to fiscal '19 and the first part of fiscal '20, before COVID, our SG&A percent was -- for all of \u201819, it was at 10 04. In the first quarter of 2020, it was a 10 34, And for the whole year, it was a 10 04 for both of those two years. And we used to think to ourselves will we ever be able to get it back below 10%. And in 2022, which was the kind of month seven through 18, if you will, that 12-month period after that full fiscal year for us of COVID, we reported an 8 88 for that year. So even at the 9 45 that we just reported, we're still quite a bit lower than we had been historically, a function of a lot of things, including higher sales productivity and all that. So I think we're doing pretty well. I think certainly, that's the challenge. How do we reduce that and how do we manage that? And certainly, the biggest way to manage is driving more sales. Look, I think when we're asked that question, we're fortunate to answer it that we're, first of all, looking at the consumer through somewhat rose-colored glasses here. The we have enjoyed great value. And again, we're convinced it's value. We've got -- I think on the margin, there's a few extra things that we've done. We've improved the site of the website. We've gotten a little better communicating stuff, not completely. But I think overall, it's -- and we've been good merchants. I think the merchants have done a great job of bringing in new stuff. And not being shy when we see an industry category down a lot, that we can still -- if we're driving people in, we've got a better chance of getting them to buy something. Thanks. Well, I would say, allowing us to get better deals, which means lower prices. But look, I think we -- Kirkland signature (ph) relative to non-gas sales is in the high-20s. And I think it was probably a good year ago when inflation was in the 8 and 9 range, if you will, if you remember. And we talked about that year-over-year, we saw probably the biggest increased penetration of KS at Costco. It was 1, 1.5 percentage points, when historically, it has been 25 basis points to 50 basis points a year. I think we're back to that, but we've maintained that higher level and we're back to seeing smaller increases in penetration every year, but nonetheless still driving that business. But we've got -- yeah. I think that helps with some of the deflationary certainly with KS stuff, we're closer to the supplier. We're not the only -- we're the only customer buying that item and we can drive a little bit more business. So I think it just continues to work that way for us. Some colleague in my room said they're buying gold. But no, that's actually online mostly. But no, I think -- again, I think the traffic thing is the thing that we're happily surprised about that we're continuing to drive people in on an increasing basis. We know we benefited during those, call it those two years, kind of March, April of '20 to March, April of '22, the kind of the two years of COVID, we benefited in many ways from more members and more volumes. And we've not only kept it, we're continuing now to add to those levels, so we feel very fortunate in that regard. One of my colleagues here just mentioned that discretionary merchandise trends are getting a little better. And that's not only on big ticket but in general, nonfood stuff. I think that corresponds with my comment earlier that we feel good about the seasonal -- how we've done seasonally. I think it's slightly -- it's deflationary. It's a little more deflationary in the KS than in the CPG, which drives more value to KS, frankly. But we're seeing some -- our ability to work with our CPG suppliers as well, but just a little stronger ability to do that with KS. And it is, again, a comment in the room here. We've had -- it's allowed us to do some new item introductions on the KS side as well. Generally speaking, if you compare, everybody was always concerned. I remember 10-plus years ago, people would ask you, how are you going after millennials? And then it's how you go after the next gen or whatever, the Gen Zs or whatever? At the end of the day, when we look at the different cohorts, if you just change the names, the curve seems to be about the same in terms of getting new younger members. They buy less, they buy more as they get older into that 40- to 55-year-old sweet spot. I don't know in terms of renewal rates. I think the rates are \u2013 our overall rates are improving so I think we're probably doing a better job there. Certainly, things like, frankly, auto renewal helped that as well. Same to you. Frankly, we look at the wages in a vacuum, and we want to do as much as we can for our employees. And certainly, there were several increases starting with the frontline worker premium during the initial year of COVID. We kept half of that in there, which we kept $1 of those $2 now in there, which was like $400 million a year. Again, we've also benefited from stronger sales and productivity so we're able to afford that. But we look at them independently and we'll continue to do that to look at it. To the extent inflationary pressures are down, that means there's probably a little less inflationary pressure on wages. But we give -- over half of our employees are top of scale and they're getting increases irrespective of some of the extra things we talked about every March. And then as you go from a new employee over the first 9,000 or 10,000 hours, you're getting constant increases that are more -- significantly more. I think it can't hurt even with gas prices have come down a little bit. That's top of mind every week when somebody fills up their tank. So those things help. I think I'm sure on a macro basis, that's the case but it's a guess on our part. Thank you. First of all, our margin range is so much more compacted than traditional retail, different categories of traditional retail. I mean, if you think about it, we have, what, 12%, 13% gross margin, 11%. I'm thinking markup, and in theory, it ranges from 0% to 15%. In reality, it's -- there's very few things that are below 5% and a lot of things hover around the 8% to 12% range. And so I don't think it's as big of an impact to us in terms of those mix changes. And I got to say it's always all saying it's always something. There's always something that hurts you and there's another thing that helps you. And it's a really -- it's a mixture. Well, first of all, when you look at like at an ROI, the eye on the denominator on an older building is a lower eye (ph). If 10 years ago, the typical building in the United States property equipment and building fixtures, I'm shooting from the hip here, was $30 million to $35 million and now it's $45 million to $50 million. So you've got a different eye. But generally speaking, when we look at the ROI of each of our eight U.S. regions, our two Canadian regions, new units come in, start a little lower and get up there over time. You'll have some outliers because of some units that are 30- and 40-years-old even with eye (ph) increase because we expanded the unit and upgraded it and remodeled it. The fact of the matter is the higher volume is really shine through there. On an international standpoint, we've always, I think, talked about the fact that there's a few different things that the ROIs in some of these other countries tend to be a little higher. The return on sales tends to be even more -- even higher than that in some of these countries because a combination very little related to gross margin, some related to membership fees, some related to wages and some related to benefits, health benefits. U.S. health care costs dwarf every other country that we're in. Thank you. I think -- well, there's always going to be another country or two we add. You need a certain number. In our view, we've always done it after there's 15 or so warehouses in the country. So that will add to it a little bit. But no, I think some of the increase -- it's kind of like getting up to that asymptotic line when you -- one of the things that drove it in the last few years, one, we've done a better job in the last several years of selling it to you as well as auto renewal. When people come in now or sign up online, they're signing up to they want to put their credit or debit card in there and they can opt in to doing it online -- doing other renewal. So I think those things have pushed it along with us being so wonderful. But I think you'll still see it come up a little bit but probably that rate of increase will slow over time. Thankfully, nothing at all. It's really -- I think what we already talked about was a combination of, as we went into some self-check out over the last several years and then perhaps more recent things that you read about in the paper, we get less impacted by the latter as well. Maybe we saw a couple of basis point delta upward on a very low number of basis points to start with. So we're fortunate in that regard. Same to you. Thank you. Yes. On the ancillary line, it's gas and e-com and it's a combination of increased sales penetration and increased margins within those businesses. The thing about gas is I think everybody out there that has gas stations, what we have found is we've been able to see improved profitability not just in the last quarter or two, but over the last few years -- last three to five years, improved profitability in gas because others are making more, and we're allowed to make a little more. When we do our competitive price shops on gas, which we do weekly at every gas stations, we operate with our neighboring competitive gas stations. On the e-comm side, I think driving more sales has helped us in the margins there as well. Yeah. On the wages, while we pointed out \u2013 I pointed out on the call, I think there was like four or so basis points in total from those two distinct increases, we do other increases like over half of our employees are top of scale. They get an increase every March that's significant as well, significant relative to basis points. When you have lower sales figures. I mean, and \u2013 the rest of it is all the other lines like energy costs and the like. It's more than half. I don't have the exact figures with me.\nQ \u2013 Laura Champine: Got it. Thank you. Well, thank you, Lisa, and thank you, everyone on the call. We're around to answer questions and have a happy holiday. And I think this is a record time of finishing this call. So enjoy the holidays. Thank you very much."
