Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for one year on our Investor Relations page at monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today.\nBernie Blegen: Thanks Gen. For the full year 2020, MPS achieved record revenue $844.5 million, growing 34.5% from the prior year. This performance represented consistent execution against our strategies and being recognized by more first tier companies for superior technologies, product quality and excellent customer. As we see more high quality growth opportunities ahead of us, we continue to successfully invest in our infrastructure and capabilities that support that growth. Here are a few highlights, which we achieved in 2020. Brought online a new 12-inch fab one year ahead of schedule allowing for qualified parts to be shipped in Q4 of this year. We will continue to invest in the capacity and diversity of our supply chain with plans to bring up a new 8-inch fab in 2021; began volume shipments of 48 volt QSMOD technology for AI applications, proving the commercial viability of our leading edge system solutions in this critically important market; Designed an integrated power management solution for autonomous driving vehicles. Shipments began to ramp in Q3 of 2020. Launched our ESG website, aggregating all of our environmental, social and governance values, policies and practices into one easily access location. Customers, employees, shareholders are now able to fully appreciate MPS's commitment to sustainability, transparency of our business practices and our ongoing social responsibility.\nA - Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session.  Our first question is from Matt Ramsay from Cohen. Matt, your line is now open.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Good evening everybody. Hey, Michael and Bernie. Hope you're well. My first question is around the supply that you guys are bringing online. You talked about a couple of different efforts and you have done over the last few quarters to add supply. And I guess, Michael, I wonder if you might characterize it as -- anyway, one, how much supply can you bring online and say the immediate term versus over the next couple of years to support what revenue levels?\nMichael Hsing: Well, we said in a couple of quarters ago, we're building a capacity to bidding dollars capability. And so that's all our long-term strategy. We'll do that anyway. And just reason -- in a reason from a last year we pulling a little faster, like we can active -- anticipated these goes up and down. So, as we play for a long-term futures and -- but in the recent years, obviously, with the pulling and increased capacities, okay, as we started in the early last year and we are a little bit ahead of the game -- ahead of the market demands. And from -- looking at near futures we are continued to do so. We still facing delinquent.\nMatt Ramsay: Got it. No, that makes sense in the long-term. I guess for my follow-up question is a more near term oriented one. Bernie, if you might give some color as how you're expecting -- I mean, the guidance was well above consensus for the March quarter. Maybe you could talk about it by segment what you're expecting the trends to be as you move from December into March. Thanks guys.\nBernie Blegen: Sure. I think that we saw in 2020 that revenue in both automotive and industrial were probably most heavily impacted because of the COVID pandemic. So what we saw in the second half of the year is that both of those two markets showed marked improvement and have significant momentum as we go into 2021. But really we're broad based. So a lot of the trends that we saw that we benefited from in 2020 will continue on, possibly the only exception is communications, which had a strong three quarters that would be difficult to compare against.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you. Congratulations on the execution. So far I think you're the only company that I've seen actually increasing your inventory days. So, congratulations on that too. Last quarter you talked about the size of the delinquencies you had in 2019. Could you give us a ballpark for where they stand right now?\nMichael Hsing: I think last quarter -- we talk about last couple of quarters, we have continued facing a delinquent -- delinquencies and this quarter is in the last quarter we are relatively similar and two quarters ago we're facing a bit quite more.\nBernie Blegen: Yeah. And I think that that's a reflection of continued strong demand in the face of industry-wide capacity constraints. So, we've actually had to manage at this level now for about the last three to four quarters. And I'm not saying that we're getting good at it, but we're certainly believe we have it as well under control as possible, a good handle on it. So that we're escalating shipments only based on the needs of the end-user, as opposed to anyone building inventory in either the channel or on customer shelves. And the reason we can meet the most off our customer's demand is -- due to we end -- we add a capacity at the beginning of last year and now we can fulfill most of it.\nTore Svanberg: Very good. And as my follow-up on capacity, you talked about the second 12-inch, also new 8-inch. I know you typically don't name your foundries on these calls. But could you at least talk about sort of the geographical aspect to where your foundry partners are at this point?\nMichael Hsing: Now, we tried to diversify outside the China as we speaking and these fabs what could be -- we're still exploring and engaged -- at the beginning of the engagement with both -- with a fab within China and outside of China.\nTore Svanberg: Great. Thank you very much. Congrats again.\nBernie Blegen: Thanks Tore.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is for Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.\nRoss Seymore: Hi, guys. Can you hear me?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Loud, clear.\nBernie Blegen: Hi, Ross.\nRoss Seymore: Hi, there. So congratulations on the growth, especially impressive, not only relative to the analog group, but the diversity of it. As you looked at 2020 is a whole, other than the year-over-year in coms, which I know is difficult. You talked a little bit about you expected to be diverse. If you just said, what some of the idiosyncratic drivers, company specific things in 2020 would be just a kind of by end market, obviously not customer specific.\nBernie Blegen: Sure. I think that in the computing, we had seen in 2018 and 2019 a run up in notebooks and really in 2020 it was increased demand in the data center, both in terms of powering servers, as well as the storage. In the consumer market, we've benefited from the once every three year refresh of the gaming console. And also we saw a nice uptick, both in home appliances, as well as wearables or mobility. And then when we look at industrial and automotive, as I said earlier, both of those seem to be handicapped at the beginning of the year where we have design wins, but we can't guarantee what the market circumstances are going to be. So, the unit sales on some of the new products we were introduced were a little limited, but certainly showed a lot of strength in the second half of the year.\nRoss Seymore: And actually, Bernie, forgive me if I misspoke. I was actually talking more about 2021. What those drive -- similar sort of story, but 2021 more looking forward then back.\nMichael Hsing: I think it's a repeat of same -- it\u2019s a 2020 to 2021.\nBernie Blegen: I'd say the only thing in the first half that gives us a little pause aside from the communications comparable is that there's probably going to be some softness in the first half of the year related to computing on the -- at the data center. But outside of that, Michael's exactly right.\nRoss Seymore: Well, maybe that's a good \u2026\nMichael Hsing: But the softness -- it's not going down. So, still going as not as a strong, but the demand is still -- slightly more than we expected. Yeah.\nRoss Seymore: Got it. And then I guess as my real follow-up. A lot of companies are questioning the sustainability of this demand and I know crystal balls are always foggy. But you guys would grow if I just analyze your first quarter guidance, 15%. I know seasonality might not be the breast framework, but there seems to be an active debate amongst investors on is, are things just too hot and there's got to be a stumble because there's excess ordering, inventory is going to build et cetera, et cetera. How are you guys viewing that kind of supply versus demand balance and the trust in the quality of the orders?\nMichael Hsing: Well -- and if you look at it in the past three or four years, okay, I mean, we grow some things like in -- from 17% to 25% in the levels. In 2019, right, we grow only 8% and -- but our designing -- all these opportunities still there. Okay? I mean, we just shifted to -- from 2019 to 2020. And so again, in the automotive, industrial in the first half a year, wasn't there. So like a catch up in the second half a year. And in a computing, communications and -- what else I'm missing\nBernie Blegen: Consumers.\nMichael Hsing: Yeah, consumers, okay. In the beginning, is a stronger than -- a little bit stronger than normal. And I will say that it's probably even out from 2019s and this year we can see that -- we never forecast a macro economy condition, but we do see these product and we facing a shortages on Amazon's on these the Best Buy and we believe these all are real.\nRoss Seymore: Okay. Thank you and congrats.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.\nRick Schafer: Thanks. And let me add my congratulations on the execution guys. I'm sure it wasn't easy up there this quarter, especially. A couple of questions. I guess I'd like to ask about a couple of your bigger growth pillars, maybe start with auto. I think it grew about 15% last year, with SAR down about 15. So just optically, it looks like you guys could do something around 50% growth this year. I mean, maybe you could talk about what leads that growth. I mean, is it ADAS, body control? Does BMS kick-in at all and kind of add -- give a little more wind to the sales this year. And I guess the second part of that question, I'm just curious, are you worried at all about indirect supply constraints, potentially limiting -- limiting your upside here?\nMichael Hsing: Let me talk about your second part first. Growth overall for MPS is limiting by our capacities and utilization of a total capacity. As you know, we have a few thousand -- 4,000 parts and it's inconceivable. We can utilize it in the entire capacities. For the auto growth, yes, okay, we -- as Bernie said earlier, we have ADAS in the stock to rent in the last quarter or so. And we have more customers start to ramp that can -- these are the very high end product and we are very pleased with it Other products in orders, we talk about it in the past, okay, from a lighting to liftgates to -- all the other power modules in auto and now we see start to ramp. We just -- just at the beginning we see all these products start to ramp. But these are still at the beginning.\nBernie Blegen: And Rick, just one more point is that, I think we've read that the auto industry is suffering from its own capacity issues or being able to have a stable supply chain. As I look at our Q1 numbers that is not directly impacting our demand or our ability to ship.\nMichael Hsing: Yeah. We are so small in a market presence in auto industry, but all of these initial ramp and it changes the needles in a revenue stream.\nRick Schafer: Thanks. And that's kind of what I was asking about. Just worried if those secondary supply constraints could end up hurting -- somebody else can't ship. Maybe my second question, Michael, just on cloud server. If you could talk about how that data center ramp looks like for QSMOD this year? I mean, it's isolate still a needle mover, or is it really more Sapphire Rapids later this year where you were kind of maybe potentially see a step function in revenues as that starts to pick up?\nMichael Hsing: Yeah. I can't relate those acronym, these names with that. I know the VR 13.5 is mostly -- is a ramp -- is a ramping now, as we see the revenue growth. Now VR 14, I think is a -- that'll be a next year story.\nRick Schafer: Thanks.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Alex Vecchi from William Blair. Alex, your line is now open.\nAlex Vecchi: Hi, guys. Congratulations on the impressive quarter from me as well. Maybe Bernie, just on a more housekeeping question, your guidance for gross margin at the midpoint is looking flat quarter-over-quarter. Is that a -- is that due to end market mix or are you seeing any increasing manufacturing costs weighing on margins? And then, how should we think about sort of that resumption back to the 10 to 20 basis points going forward?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. We -- obviously now you see the consumers segment is growth too, and we have some -- and the slightly, or even with the lower gross margin. On the other hand, yes. The manufacturer costs is going up.\nAlex Vecchi: Okay. That's helpful. And then just on your inventory days, you guys have talked in the past about the 180, 200 day target. You've made some improvements quarter. How do we think about getting back to an ideal inventory level in terms of timing?\nMichael Hsing: Well, it's -- demand keep coming as is now. It wouldn't be difficult. We think about it end of the end of the year, we hope we will can go back to 180 to 200 days of inventory.\nBernie Blegen: Yeah. I think if you look at whether it's the inventory that we hold on our books or particularly in the channel, it's very lean right now, and then we've already discussed delinquencies. So, we have a lot of catch up to do before we really can get the model to the 180 to 200-day goal.\nAlex Vecchi: Understood. That's it for me. I'll pass it along to the next.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton from Needham. Quinn, Your line is now open.\nQuinn Bolton: Hey, guys. I will offer my congratulations as well. Just wanted to follow-up on Alex's question on the delinquencies and your ability to catch up with some of those delinquencies. I mean, how much of the ability to meet those delinquencies is going to come from the new 12-inch fab that you brought online in the fourth quarter of last year. Are you able to qualify more parts and other high volume runners on that fab? Or just kind of curious your ability to actually get to secure more wafer capacity from your five foundry partners in this very tight environment. I guess, a lot of companies are saying that they think supply constraints -- supply is going to remain constraint all year, which makes it sound like being able to get back to 180 to 200 days, delinquencies is a pretty tall order in calendar 2021.\nBernie Blegen: Yeah. It's a great question. And thanks for allowing us the opportunity to give a little more context here. With the new fab, I mean, we were very pleased to report is one of our highlights that we were able to qualify parts and be able to inventory and ship them. But that process of qualifying more parts so that it can be meaningful as far as both deliveries and the dressing our delinquencies is ongoing. And it's going to require an investment both in the 12-inch capability, as well as this new fab that we're bringing up in 2021. So just because we've qualified a few parts and we've got the process started, it still takes about nine to 12 months before you have the full capability of.\nMichael Hsing: In 2020, we increase our capacity by 25%. It's -- pointing of off from my head, my rough calculations is about 20% to 25% increase last year.\nQuinn Bolton: I guess, my follow-up question was just on the comms space. Obviously, you had three very strong quarters in 2020, and then one of your large customers was no longer able to ship. I believe you may now have a license to resume shipments to that customer. And I'm just wondering if that's the case, do you have now perhaps a better outlook than you might have 90 days ago for the comms business in 2021?\nMichael Hsing: Absolutely. We will have a more clear -- and the customer start to place -- placing orders now.\nBernie Blegen: Yeah. And I think there's two forms. There's a -- you identified one customer in particular. And I think we might see that begin to ramp in the second half of this year. But I think more broadly other opportunities are starting to come on not just with the top tier, but some of the second tier customers in the 5G and infrastructure area.\nQuinn Bolton: Great. Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from William Stein from Truist. William, your line is now open.\nWilliam Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Michael, I'm wondering if you can update us on the longer term transition to selling more modules. I know that's something that is from a long-term perspective, potentially very creative to growth and margins. I think we're still pretty early in that process, but any movement in the quarter that you'd like to highlight?\nMichael Hsing: I think it's -- the result is a very good in the middle of this high demand. Actually, Bernie can tell you what is the ramps, okay, what is the increase.\nBernie Blegen: Yeah. We had -- revenue doubled in 2020, and we exited the year where it continued to increase sequentially quarter. And it's interesting because we thought that it would have more narrow applications, particularly in industrial. But in fact, it's proven to be very broad based and also is sustainable. What I mean by that last point is that we thought that if people want to unit volumes, they might be more likely to go to components and just buy Silicon. And in fact, we're seeing a lot of people that are going into volume shipments with the modules as well.\nMichael Hsing: Yeah. It's all across our product lines. That's so I don't have total numbers for the modules that are -- in roughly, so like a $30 million, $40 million now, okay, I mean, compare a year ago. As Bernie said, it is half of that.\nWilliam Stein: Great. And then one other thing I'd like to ask about is your MPS NOW service, did you see any change in that in the quarter? I know that's something that seemed to come online sort of just in time for the work-from-home COVID situation that I think was very helpful for you. Any change in that and any anticipated change if we hopefully are able to return to offices in the next quarter or two.\nMichael Hsing: Yeah. This is -- it's a great help. We set it up, okay, just at the beginning of our -- just the right before pandemics. All these softwares, videos everything's and also the bench, okay, the working bench, we just set that up we turn it on when the pandemic happens and it's receiver enormous praise from our customers. And in terms of how many new customers, we are really, really careful about. We increased a few thousand percent from the videos, from the virtual bench. Yeah.\nWilliam Stein: Great. Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Kevin Garrigan from Rosenblatt. Kevin, your line is now open.\nKevin Garrigan: Hi, guys. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one for me. You alluded a little to this earlier, but in your automotive segment, you've expanded into several other features of the automobile besides kind of infotainment. But can you give us -- can you talk a little bit about some of your design wins there? Are you kind of seeing more design wins and the ones you already have, how are kind of those progressing?\nMichael Hsing: Well, I think I should answer Rick Schafer's questions the more precise. The BMS is not -- we don't have a clear design wins in all those sites. And -- but to answer -- your question is we have pretty much across the board in from the body controls to ADAS and to lightings and to ADAS and also to all the sensors. And we have pretty much across the board, but our content that we expanded from $150, $140, and essentially doubled it. And -- but everything's at the beginning, while MPS' revenue so small, so we just -- but you see the net change.\nBernie Blegen: On the dollar content, I just want to go back to that because it's an important part is this is not just unit sales, but some of the new applications that we're bringing on. We go from having $10 of available content to upwards of $40 or $50 for a complete system. So, we're getting both the unit as well as the ASP expansion.\nMichael Hsing: We're not talking about revenue small as a compare the market opportunity. As we said, we address the $6 billion market segments. And as now all MPS' product became as a total -- that's a total state. And we only have over hundred some million dollars in revenues.\nBernie Blegen: $110 million.\nMichael Hsing: Yeah. $110 million in the most of a new product and ramping started from last year, second half of year.\nBernie Blegen: Yeah.\nKevin Garrigan: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.\nRoss Seymore: Hey guys, thanks for letting me ask a couple of quick follow-ups. Just two quick ones. First, you mentioned an answering a prior question about your ability to ship to the formerly banned product or banned customer. Is that just in the comms space or is that ban some of why your computing and storage segment also went down sequentially in the fourth quarter?\nBernie Blegen: Again, we don't generally talk about individual customers. Sine this one's gotten so much visibility. We actually have three primary lines of business with them. One is in the consumer, one is in the data center and the other is an infrastructure.\nRoss Seymore: Infrastructure meaning comms, right?\nBernie Blegen: Yes.\nRoss Seymore: Gotcha. Okay. And is there any difference in what you're able to ship going forward out of those three things? Are you able to ship all of them, or is it just -- not the 5G stuff, but the other two?\nMichael Hsing: Well, our products there -- again, there's a -- says the building blocks, okay. I mean, particularly in form former comm business and also \u2026\nBernie Blegen: Data center.\nMichael Hsing: The data centers, okay. And the shared same product. And we don't know exactly what they -- how they divide it. But consumer device -- consumer device more in the chargers, in the -- that we know. It's a pretty much -- it's continues.\nBernie Blegen: Yeah.\nRoss Seymore: Gotcha. And then, the last question is a little bit more housekeeping wise. Bernie, what are you thinking about tax rate for 2021?\nBernie Blegen: Yeah. So, on a non-GAAP basis, we've historically used 7.5% and now we've moved to 10%, which represents that there's certain stock comp that is not as a deductible as it was in prior years. And then, looking ahead, we're not going to try to out guess what the Biden administration is going to do. But I think that we need to be sensitive to the fact that there may be increases both in the domestic rate as well as a higher tax rate on any international profits.\nMichael Hsing: Yeah. We don't know at this point. \nRoss Seymore: Got it. Thanks guys.\nGenevieve Cunningham: If there are any follow-up questions, please click the raise hand button. As there are no further questions, I'd like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.\nBernie Blegen: Great. Thank you everybody. Appreciate your joining us for this conference call and look forward to talking to you again the first quarter of 2021, which should likely be in the April timeframe. Thanks again, and have a nice day.",

            "content": "Well, we said in a couple of quarters ago, we're building a capacity to bidding dollars capability. And so that's all our long-term strategy. We'll do that anyway. And just reason -- in a reason from a last year we pulling a little faster, like we can active -- anticipated these goes up and down. So, as we play for a long-term futures and -- but in the recent years, obviously, with the pulling and increased capacities, okay, as we started in the early last year and we are a little bit ahead of the game -- ahead of the market demands. And from -- looking at near futures we are continued to do so. We still facing delinquent. I think last quarter -- we talk about last couple of quarters, we have continued facing a delinquent -- delinquencies and this quarter is in the last quarter we are relatively similar and two quarters ago we're facing a bit quite more. Now, we tried to diversify outside the China as we speaking and these fabs what could be -- we're still exploring and engaged -- at the beginning of the engagement with both -- with a fab within China and outside of China. Yes. Loud, clear. I think it's a repeat of same -- it's a 2020 to 2021. But the softness -- it's not going down. So, still going as not as a strong, but the demand is still -- slightly more than we expected. Yeah. Well -- and if you look at it in the past three or four years, okay, I mean, we grow some things like in -- from 17% to 25% in the levels. In 2019, right, we grow only 8% and -- but our designing -- all these opportunities still there. Okay? I mean, we just shifted to -- from 2019 to 2020. And so again, in the automotive, industrial in the first half a year, wasn't there. So like a catch up in the second half a year. And in a computing, communications and -- what else I'm missing Yeah, consumers, okay. In the beginning, is a stronger than -- a little bit stronger than normal. And I will say that it's probably even out from 2019s and this year we can see that -- we never forecast a macro economy condition, but we do see these product and we facing a shortages on Amazon's on these the Best Buy and we believe these all are real. Let me talk about your second part first. Growth overall for MPS is limiting by our capacities and utilization of a total capacity. As you know, we have a few thousand -- 4,000 parts and it's inconceivable. We can utilize it in the entire capacities. For the auto growth, yes, okay, we -- as Bernie said earlier, we have ADAS in the stock to rent in the last quarter or so. And we have more customers start to ramp that can -- these are the very high end product and we are very pleased with it Other products in orders, we talk about it in the past, okay, from a lighting to liftgates to -- all the other power modules in auto and now we see start to ramp. We just -- just at the beginning we see all these products start to ramp. But these are still at the beginning. Yeah. We are so small in a market presence in auto industry, but all of these initial ramp and it changes the needles in a revenue stream. Yeah. I can't relate those acronym, these names with that. I know the VR 13.5 is mostly -- is a ramp -- is a ramping now, as we see the revenue growth. Now VR 14, I think is a -- that'll be a next year story. Yes. We -- obviously now you see the consumers segment is growth too, and we have some -- and the slightly, or even with the lower gross margin. On the other hand, yes. The manufacturer costs is going up. Well, it's -- demand keep coming as is now. It wouldn't be difficult. We think about it end of the end of the year, we hope we will can go back to 180 to 200 days of inventory. In 2020, we increase our capacity by 25%. It's -- pointing of off from my head, my rough calculations is about 20% to 25% increase last year. Absolutely. We will have a more clear -- and the customer start to place -- placing orders now. I think it's -- the result is a very good in the middle of this high demand. Actually, Bernie can tell you what is the ramps, okay, what is the increase. Yeah. It's all across our product lines. That's so I don't have total numbers for the modules that are -- in roughly, so like a $30 million, $40 million now, okay, I mean, compare a year ago. As Bernie said, it is half of that. Yeah. This is -- it's a great help. We set it up, okay, just at the beginning of our -- just the right before pandemics. All these softwares, videos everything's and also the bench, okay, the working bench, we just set that up we turn it on when the pandemic happens and it's receiver enormous praise from our customers. And in terms of how many new customers, we are really, really careful about. We increased a few thousand percent from the videos, from the virtual bench. Yeah. Well, I think I should answer Rick Schafer's questions the more precise. The BMS is not -- we don't have a clear design wins in all those sites. And -- but to answer -- your question is we have pretty much across the board in from the body controls to ADAS and to lightings and to ADAS and also to all the sensors. And we have pretty much across the board, but our content that we expanded from $150, $140, and essentially doubled it. And -- but everything's at the beginning, while MPS' revenue so small, so we just -- but you see the net change. We're not talking about revenue small as a compare the market opportunity. As we said, we address the $6 billion market segments. And as now all MPS' product became as a total -- that's a total state. And we only have over hundred some million dollars in revenues. Yeah. $110 million in the most of a new product and ramping started from last year, second half of year. Well, our products there -- again, there's a -- says the building blocks, okay. I mean, particularly in form former comm business and also ... The data centers, okay. And the shared same product. And we don't know exactly what they -- how they divide it. But consumer device -- consumer device more in the chargers, in the -- that we know. It's a pretty much -- it's continues. Yeah. We don't know at this point."

Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for one year on our Investor Relations page at monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. During this webinar, we will discuss our Q3 2020 financial results and guidance for Q4 2020, followed by a Q&A session. Analysts you are currently needed, if you wish to ask a question during the Q&A session, please click on the participants icon on the menu bar and then click the raise hand button. In the course of today's webinar, we will be making forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q3 2020 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2020 and in our Form 10-Q filed on August 3, 2020, which are accessible through our Web site, monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q3 2019, Q2 2020 and Q3 2020 releases as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our Web site. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.\nBernie Blegen: Thanks, Gen. MPS achieved record third quarter revenue of $259.4 million, 39.3% higher than revenue in the second quarter of 2020, and 53.7% higher than the comparable quarter in 2019. As noted in our September 14, 2020 update to our Q3 financial guidance, our revenue increased beyond expectations for two key reasons; first, we were able to fulfill our customers' demand that had been delinquent due to past capacity constraints; second, certain China-based customers requested previously scheduled shipment dates be pulled into the third quarter of 2020. We believe this request was related to trade and regulatory policy changes that occurred during the quarter. These two factors contributed significantly to this quarter's performance relative to the prior quarter of 2020 and to Q3 of 2019. Looking at our revenue by market. Third quarter 2020 communications revenue of $54.7 million was up 81.8% from the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to a pull-in of customers requested ship dates. Communications sales represented 21.1% of our total third quarter 2020 revenue. In our consumer markets, third quarter 2020 revenue of $70.2 million increased 47.4% from revenue reported for the prior quarter of 2020. This extraordinary growth in consumer reflects a combination of market share gains in gaming, wearables and IoT applications along with normal seasonality. Consumer revenue represented 27.1% of our third quarter 2020 revenue. In our computing and storage market, third quarter revenue of $75.3 million increased $11.2 million or 17.5% from the second quarter of 2020. The sequential quarterly revenue growth was broad-based with sales gains recorded in high-end notebooks, servers and storage. Computing and storage revenue represented 29% of MPS' third quarter 2020 revenue. Third quarter automotive revenue of $28.5 million grew $10.7 million or 60.4% over the second quarter of 2020. This improvement reflects a more normal ordering level following the Q2 2020 industrywide slowdown resulting from the pandemic. We believe MPS' market share will continue to expand in the coming years as we have been awarded multiple design wins in infotainment, smart lighting, ADAS and autonomous driving. Automotive revenue was 11.0% of MPS' total third quarter 2020 revenue. Third quarter 2020 industrial revenue of $30.7 million increased 15.3% from the second quarter of 2020, due primarily to increased revenue for power sources and industrial meters. Industrial revenue represented 11.8% of our total third quarter 2020 revenue. GAAP gross margin was 55.1%, matching the second quarter of 2020 and 10 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2019. Our GAAP operating income was $60.0 million compared to $28.0 million reported in the second quarter of 2020 and $30.0 million reported in the third quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 55.5%, 20 basis points below the gross margin reported for the second quarter of 2020 and 10 basis points lower than the third quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $84.9 million compared to $53.0 million reported in the prior quarter and $51.4 million reported in the third quarter of 2019. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $83.1 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared with $74.6 million in the second quarter of 2020 and $63.1 million in the third quarter of 2019. Our non-GAAP third quarter 2020 operating expenses were $59.1 million, up from the $50.7 million we spent in the second quarter of 2020 and up from the $42.5 million reported in the third quarter of 2019. The sequential increase in Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses primarily reflected higher variable costs associated with the increase in revenue and an increased level of investment in securing foundry capacity. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense, an income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the third quarter of 2020, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $707,000 charged to cost of goods sold was $23.0 million compared with $21.0 million recorded in the second quarter of 2020. Switching to the bottom-line. Third quarter 2020 GAAP net income was $55.6 million or $1.18 per fully diluted share compared with $30.2 million or $0.64 per share in the second quarter of 2020 and $29.5 million or $0.64 per share in the third quarter of 2019. Q3 non-GAAP net income was $79.4 million or $1.69 per fully diluted share compared with $50.6 million or $1.08 per share in the second quarter of 2020 and $49.5 million or $1.08 per share in the third quarter of 2019. Fully diluted shares at the end of Q3 2020 were $47.0 million. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $554.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 2020 compared to $515.4 million at the end of the second quarter of 2020. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $77.4 million compared with Q2 2020 operating cash flow of $59.3 million. Third quarter 2020 capital spending totaled $19.6 million. Accounts receivable ended the third quarter of 2020 at $93.5 million representing 33 days of sales outstanding which was six days higher than the 27 days reported at the end of the second quarter of 2020 and two days higher than the 31 days at the end of the third quarter of 2019. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2020 were $148.1 million, down from the $152.1 million at the end of the second quarter of 2020. Days of inventory of 116 days at the end of the third quarter 2020 were 50 days lower than at the end of the second quarter of 2020. The sequential drop in days inventory on hand represented an anomaly due to a decrease in the dollar value of inventory and a 39% increase in quarterly revenue. Currently, our inventory levels are lean. We are working very hard to return inventory to the 180 to 200-day level necessary to support our future growth. I would now like to turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of 2020. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $218 million to $230 million. We also expect the following; GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.1% to 55.7%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.4% to 56.0%; total stock-based compensation expense of $21.8 million to $23.8 million, including approximately $700,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold; GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $81.3 million and $85.3 million; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $60.2 million to $62.2 million; litigation expense should range between $1.8 million to $2.2 million; interest income is expected to range from $1.0 million to $1.4 million; fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.1 million to 48.1 million shares. In conclusion, we will monitor market conditions closely and continue to execute. I'll now open the webinar up for questions.\nA - Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session.  Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.\nTore Svanberg: Congratulations on the $1 billion run rate. First question is Q4 guidance. Could you talk a little bit about which are some of the end markets that's going to be performing in Q4? Obviously, I know communications is going to be down but what about some of the other markets for the December quarter?\nBernie Blegen: Tore, thanks for commenting on the $1 billion run rate. Yes, if you compare ourselves against Q3, obviously, that was a high watermark. So probably a more relevant comparison is against Q4 of 2019. And on that basis, we're expecting all of our major markets to be up significantly from the prior year. And then, when you do the comparison against Q3, you'll see that there'll probably be declines in communications and computing and also in consumer, the consumer is seasonally adjusted but we'll still expect to see improvements in industrial and automotive.\nTore Svanberg: Very good. And as my follow-up, you mentioned inventories are pretty lean, so can you just elaborate a little bit on what you're doing to try and get the inventories back up? You said you had some OpEx to maybe secure some foundry capacity but anything else you can add on sort of how you're going to get back to that 180 days of inventory?\nBernie Blegen: Sure. I think as we acknowledged in Q3 that we were able to catch up as far as having adequate capacity in order to service near-term demand and in giving guidance for Q4 that expectation follows along. When we look ahead over the course of the next 24 months, we previously mentioned that we're entering into new relationships with other fabs and expect to grow our overall capacity. So this will be an ongoing investment that we would project for at least about the next six quarters.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from David Williams from Loop Capital. David, your line is now open.\nWill Stein: I think there is a mistake. It's Will Stein from Truist. How are you? I guess I'll just go. Bernie, first a clarification. The inventory target that you called out in your script, I think you said 180 to 200. I think that's 20 days higher than what you said on the last conference call. Is that correct? And if so, can you help us understand what's changed?\nBernie Blegen: The previous metrics that we had been using were about 20 days lower, but we've really made this change as far as what we've been trying to explain to the analysts and to investors over the course of about the last two to three quarters. But nonetheless, I do want to address your question, which is in order for us to sustain the level of growth that we have in excess of our market, the industry that we have to have a higher level of inventory, so in other words, there is a mismatch. In other words, we are building the inventory today, but we're not going to -- for the sales that will occur one or two quarters out. And so it's not a perfect reflection for other companies where they're not growing as fast. They can maintain lower levels in terms of days, but here, again, we have to make an incremental investment in order to allow to support our growth.\nMichael Hsing: Let me add. As you remember, end of the last year and we are at around 200 days of inventory. If we use that model and to meet this year growth, that probably -- that's about the right numbers. That's the basis that's where this 20 more days come from. And so if you go to a little more details and MPS is a fabulous company, and yet, we have own technologies. This is very unique. I can't think of any of our competitors, they're in the same way of manufacturing and they do to fulfill their manufacturing. Most of them, they have their own fab. And so given the volatilities and also given the growth that we have and also number of product and address all the greenfield market segment, we need probably more than 200 days inventories.\nWill Stein: Okay. That helps a lot. If I can have one quick follow-up. The guidance, while great overall on revenue and EPS, the margins are a little bit different from what maybe some would have expected. And Bernie, I'm just wondering if you can tell us if the model we should be thinking about, which historically was that gross would grow at 10 to 20 bps a quarter. And op margin, either there was a, I guess, change in that view that perhaps we wouldn't get an operating margin leverage for the next year or two. Maybe you could just update us on that model for both those lines.\nBernie Blegen: Sure. And I think that you captured it very well is that obviously, our model has been to improve gross margin 10 to 20 basis points sequentially. Now a lot of factors weigh into being able to deliver against those results, including both our mix of business as well as what the market looks like. So again, you have to use these as guidelines, not as an absolute guarantee of what our performance will look like. And then, on the operating expenses, right now, we are going to be continuing to invest in capacity as I said in each of the next six quarters. So that will be an additional layer of investment from what we've seen and so as a result we're not projecting our operating margins to improve significantly over the course of the next two years.\nWill Stein: OpEx, I think, is that right? In other words, op margin would just expand with gross, which is 10 to 20 bps a quarter? Or...\nBernie Blegen: Yes.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from David Williams from Loop Capital. David your line is now open. Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton from Needham. Quinn your line is now open.\nQuinn Bolton: Let me offer my congratulations on a very strong September and good December outlook. Bernie and Michael, these are sort of unprecedented times in the business and I know you don't typically look out more than a quarter. But I guess, one of the questions I'm hearing from investors is, whether there is any sort of inflated demand still impacting the business in the December quarter. And wondering, to the extent you can give us any sort of thoughts on March, would March show a typical seasonal decline from the December quarter of, say, 3% to 5%, what you would see in a typical year or do you think it could show a greater seasonal factor? I know you don't typically go out two quarters, but again, this is really strong results here in the near term.\nMichael Hsing: Let me answer that question. If you're talking about normal seasonality then the outlook is great. And we have so many design in activities and we see so many award projects and as well as you know as well as I know, these were in unprecedented era, pandemics and geopolitical issues and I can't predict and frankly, I care less.\nBernie Blegen: And if I can just add to that is that. I really think that there are certain aspects of our business that we have in good control, as Michael hit on as far as the design wind activity, but right now, we do not have control over what the end customer demand is ultimately going to be about. So I think that as far as executing against our strategy and seeing it show up in our results, I think we're going to continue along that path but there are just too many factors for us, it would be pure speculation at this point.\nQuinn Bolton: Maybe I could ask, in past calls, you've oftentimes given us some idea of your sort of starting backlog coverage and I know that typically runs a very high percentage of the revenue guidance. I guess is, with some of the delinquencies you had a past quarter, you had very strong backlog. But as you head into the December quarter, so backlog sort of back to more normal levels that it would have typically run in the last couple of years? Is it still elevated? Can you give us any thoughts on kind of the backlog coverage?\nMichael Hsing: Well, as the December quarter -- go into December quarters, we are still facing delinquencies. So the capacity is still limited.\nBernie Blegen: And I think what we're seeing here is that, as I said, in the guidance that we offered is it anticipates both the demand, including the backlog that we had coming into the quarter and it's matched with what our supply chain and capacity limits are. So I guess that I would probably offer that we have some ability for upside, but it's going to be a little bit limited by supply chain.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Alex Vecchi from William Blair. Alex your line is now open.\nAlex Vecchi: Michael and Bernie, congratulations, again, in a very volatile environment. If we can just touch base a little more on the automotive segment. This appears to be the highest revenue quarter you guys have posted since really starting to gain traction in the segment. I've realized the environment is just starting now to get a little bit better. But can you maybe update us on how we should think about the long-term growth targets there? In the past, you've said 40% to 60% growth, obviously, that may be a little premature at this point, but perhaps, update us on how you're feeling on that segment.\nBernie Blegen: I would probably say that automotive is one of the more exciting end markets for us for the next several years. Now if you look at our track record in 2019 and 2020, 2019 was affected by the recession, 2020 by factory closings related to the COVID-19 pandemic. So again, those are circumstances that were largely outside of our control. But what we're seeing is that we're expanding now from our traditional infotainment base into some of these more exciting technologies, including the lighting systems, the ADAS and the autonomous driving. So we think that this is a sustainable revenue growth should be well ahead of what our corporate average is going to be. At one time, we were promoting the concept of being able to grow consistently at 20% to 60% per year, but that would probably back off of that down to a more reasonable between 30% and 40%, but still a very exciting end market for us.\nMichael Hsing: Bernie  talking. Okay. Frankly, I don't have clear pictures. And what's the growth? Frankly, I never put MPS' as we have to grow a certain percentage, okay? And what I'm looking at it is, what kind of product, which project and how well we're positioned and which customers, which projects we want designing. And a lot more importantly, okay, what kind of products in the pipeline. That really drives the top line. And so how we predicted what's the next lowest growth percentage, I can't tell you.\nAlex Vecchi: No, no, that's fair, but it's good to hear that the trajectory seems to be sort of back on track. And then, similarly, I don't think in the prepared comments you guys commented on the extent of the pull-ins into Q3. Is it fair to say that the vast majority of the sequential decline in Q4 is related to the pull-in activities or is there also a little bit of normalization of demand in there as well?\nMichael Hsing: Well, we had a lot of pulling from Q3 and partially in Q4. As I said earlier, we're still facing delinquencies. And so I think that's a combination of the growth and also in a capacity shortage from that past. Okay.\nAlex Vecchi: From that past, okay. And then lastly, if I can, on just on the days inventory, the 180 to 200 days, how long will it take you to get back to that level? Is that something you can achieve in Q4, we really looking to more the first half of 2021?\nMichael Hsing: Well, if the market slows down, we're going to get there quickly. Again, and this is -- we're at uncomfortable levels. I can meet that. And so we want to increase as much as we can. And now our engineers working the fabs, okay, working at the different fabs and to get the -- to qualify the process and technologies. And so, we hope that in the next six months, we can catch up.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Joshua Buchalter from Cowen. Joshua, your line is now open.\nJoshua Buchalter: Let me echo my congrats. As for my first question, earlier this year, you'd mentioned bringing in additional 12-inch fab online in the second half. As I was wondering, was this the primary driver of the additional capacity you were able to secure in the third quarter? And then looking ahead, how much more capacity do you feel you need to both serve your customers and get the inventory levels up to that that you raise 180 to 200 days?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Okay. The first question is, yes, absolutely, okay. We said earlier this year, we expanded another 12-inch fab, wasn't in our plan, but we hurried up and get that thing going. And we start shipping product in Q3. That's unprecedented and thanks to our people. And they really worked in day and night to manage and qualify these products. Going forward, we just want to expand the capacity to reach 180 to 200 days inventory. And going in the future, if we have a very linear world and then it is very easy to calculate. I think we are living in a very non-linear environment and 200 days inventory, that's what we want to do.\nJoshua Buchalter: Got it. That's very helpful. And then for my follow-up, a bit of a bigger picture question. I mean, you guys are now $1 billion or you reached $1 billion run rate this quarter. Are you seeing any increase or changes in the competitive responses from your peers as you move higher on both a unit basis and as well in the socket value?\nMichael Hsing: Our ASPs increasing and when we move to high-end market segments. And so, our competitions are always pretty similar. I mean our customer doesn't even know MPS' is $1 billion. There are no MPS. MPS is very small potatoes against all these giants.\nBernie Blegen: But I think you go back to what our competitive basis is, and it really is that we're winning with superior technology and a higher level of customer service and I think that's what our customers are recognizing as far.\nMichael Hsing: That's right, yes.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.\nRick Schafer: Maybe just a quick follow-on, if I can, on that production question. I know you guys have been pulling in new production and foundry partners pretty aggressively. I mean, I know you've spoken, I think in the past about sort of once it's done, the goal is to kind of be at that $1.2 billion or so in kind of annual revenues. And that's not a lot of headroom for you guys at your current run rate at your current growth rate. So I'm curious, is that $1.2 billion still the right number we should be thinking of in terms of your capacity when all said and done? And maybe what does the time line look like for that now since you're pulling stuff in?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Okay. Obviously, the $1.2 billion is not enough. And if you want to building a fast on the 200 days inventories, it's more than double it right now. So that's what we try to do and it's not easy and that's what we're aiming for, just double it.\nBernie Blegen: And I think that in the past, securing fab capacity and being able to introduce new products at the rate that we are is really nothing new to MPS. But the scale has been getting bigger and so that's why the investments and the time that we have to plan ahead makes a difference. And so all we're doing is preparing both for the capacity but also recognizing acknowledging the investment that goes with it.\nRick Schafer: So if we fast forward 18 months, 24 months, I mean, is there a bogey for where you think your capacity will be? I mean if it's not $1.2 billion, I assume higher than that, but I'm just curious if there is a number you can share or if you know at this point?\nMichael Hsing: I'm sorry, I wasn't clear. We're shooting for $2 billion.\nRick Schafer: $2 billion? I'm sorry, I misunderstood. Sorry. Thanks Michael. And then just maybe a question, if I could on 5G. And maybe I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your exposure to the Tier-1 5G ran OEMs, the one that you're allowed to sell to, of course. Where you are in terms of revenue ramp or design win activity? I mean, are any of these guys buying QSMOD yet? Or are you sort of initially seeing more POL issues kind of similar to what you saw in the early stages of your cloud server ramp?\nMichael Hsing: I think 5G overall at an early stage. And all I can say now that we engage with all the 5G station makers. And we do have a designing activity and we do have award projects but it's not significant revenue yet.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.\nRoss Seymore: I want to give the same congrats that everybody else did, stupendous work here. A couple of quick questions. First, when do you expect the delinquencies to be gone?\nMichael Hsing: If the market slows down, we're going to do that next quarter. If the demand is still that strong, we continue to face that. And we see some not as bad as last quarters -- last two quarters.\nRoss Seymore: And then on the supply side of the equation somewhat, but maybe even more of a regulatory issue. What's the exposure? And how are you dealing with the Huawei ban? And does the SMIC band have any impact on you, whether it's in the supply side or otherwise?\nMichael Hsing: Well, Huawei is not our supplier. But SMIC, it is our supplier. So far, it's not affecting us, and we don't know. We can't speculate, what does all these policy means that came in. But on the other hand and we diversified our foundry sources. We're starting from a beginning of this year. We speed it up.\nRoss Seymore: So on the Huawei side, just to be clear, you had them as a customer, I believe, in the first half of the year one way or the other. And I assume you're no longer shipping to them and I just wondered if that's part of fourth quarter guidance is then going to zero.\nMichael Hsing: Well, we can say zero or some non-zero, and so far, we cannot ship. But there is other rules and regulations coming out and all the other permits, I mean, we cannot speculating or what kind of things we can do and it's all depending on our government now.\nRoss Seymore: I guess the last question then away from government type questions is, Bernie, you and Michael have had a framework in for many, many years about the percentage superior growth versus the analog market that you guys have delivered. I think it's been kind of a 10% to 15% positive delta in your favor. Is that rule just thrown out the window now? This year is 25, 30 points above that peer group. And I know one year doesn't make a trend, but as you look at it, is there something that's creating some semblance of escape velocity where that delta expands meaningfully just due to the breadth of your design wins, the markets you're targeting or do we expect a little bit of a reversion to the mean in 2021 after such a great 2020?\nMichael Hsing: Well, as I said, the world is not linear. And I remember and I was facing a lot of, I was facing a lot of questions about when our model is like a 20% to 25% growth rate. In 2016, 2017 or 2015, 2016 and we will criticize you will never get there, although we're somewhere around 17%, 18%. And you asked so many times, you forced me say it at the time. I think around 2016, I said that -- but 2018, 2019, we're going to get it over 20%. And that comment is pulling off from my ears, this is not a science. I mean in a non-linear world, it's very difficult to predict. And so I said earlier, we only can anticipate it and by staffing the inventories and by stock inventories. And just get ready, and of course, and the world crashes. Of course, we're not we're going to start to depleting inventories. And we're not building as many as much and so we can modulate the inside a little bit. But for the growth rate, I see all these designing activities and all these projects, I will say last couple of years is better than two, three years before. And we awarded a lot more high-value products, high-value sockets.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.\nTore Svanberg: I just had a follow-up, Michael, on e-commerce. That's obviously a business model that could help you manage capacity, inventory and so on and so forth. Have you been able to keep up with the investments there in this environment, maybe you could just update us on where the e-commerce business stands today?\nMichael Hsing: We didn't prepare the numbers. We're doing really good. And I thought that there was nobody going to ask the question because...\nBernie Blegen: We have so much other news.\nMichael Hsing: It is okay. I feel, I can say, we've figured out the way to do it. And so until we prove ourselves wrong again. The new website as I think you see it. It's very different and we increased a whole lot more clicks and the customers stay on the pages for a lot longer. And also, we're creating a virtual labs and that part also helps the e-commerce. So we don't have the product FAEs and have them pounding the payment to generate opportunities and we're using the Web site. And the numbers and the increase by increased weekly and I'm very pleased and so we're talking about a few hundred percentage increase from a small number. It doesn't mean a lot, but for us and we learned it. That's the trick. That's the area we're going to do. We're going to enhance that.\nBernie Blegen: I didn't know that there's an even higher arching strategy here where e-commerce is a significant part of and it's really how do you go after underserved customers. And what was surprising to me is, we did look at the last three years as far as how many customers did we have that were under $100,000 and how is that base growing. Because if you can use the linear model, where what they used to do is get in there early...\nMichael Hsing: The linear technology.\nBernie Blegen: ..linear technology, getting there early and then develop these long-term relationships and then you grow with their growth. And so as a part of that strategy, I think we're -- the numbers I looked at, we're doing a very good job. They're starting to bear dividends.\nMichael Hsing: We increased these number like three or four times.\nBernie Blegen: Yes.\nMichael Hsing: And from a small base. And that is a significant and it has happened in the last few years. And now clearly, we can put the metrics. And so, an old saying is that, what you measure what you get. And we know how -- start to know how to -- what to measure and that's to me, is very important. But I'm looking at the revenue-wise, it became meaningful, but I don't have clear details. I don't want to have a pull out my higher numbers.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.\nRick Schafer: And speaking of things that haven't been talked about as much maybe in the last couple of quarters. I'm curious if you could give us an update on the design win pipeline or revenue color for your converter business. I'm just curious, has ADI, Maxim opened any doors for you guys? And have you seen the level of engagement with customers increase maybe as a side note or are you seeing more analog, does it line into your resumes or is it easier to find guys? So I'm just curious if you could give us any update there.\nMichael Hsing: Finding good people as always hard. All these good company that keep the good people and that's always a challenge. And so we know that we need a diversified. And that came in a lot of times in the last 10, 15 years or more likely the last 20 years. We have a lot of people from China came in. And now two or four, five years ago, we migrated to Europe and the Taiwan and outside of the Mainland China. Now in the last couple of years, it will come back to U.S., and we do see, not necessarily in the Bay Area but other parts of the countries, we do find some talents there.\nRick Schafer: And Michael, any update on what's happening with converters for you guys?\nMichael Hsing: The converters, which...\nRick Schafer: The signal chain stuff the team you brought in. I think it's been a couple of quarters since we talked about ADAS.\nBernie Blegen: High-performance analog, yes.\nMichael Hsing: Oh, yes. The data converters. Okay. Yes. Okay. I think we received the first chip.\nBernie Blegen: This is prototyping.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. And I think we're building solutions and as most of the time, the first chip will have some bugs, it's  and we are building a prototype. We still can't put in a system yet now.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open.\nWill Stein: Follow-up from before. We're just -- someone else asked about e-commerce, but I'm hoping you might give us an update on the eMotion and module business and maybe the programmable traction generally. I think about these as sort of separate from e-commerce, maybe they're not as separate but an update on this part of it would be really helpful.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. I think we use that e-commerce platform to promote those products. And that eMotion side, I think the revenues, I had to say some number now otherwise I don't know whether you guys think of whether I do have numbers. I want to have Bernie's. Sometimes it increase almost double. The motion side.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. The eMotion is right in that sort of transition phase because we have a lot of design wins that are going in. So last year, the revenue run rate was somewhere in the $10 million to $12 million, but now the doubling is going to start, particularly as we go into both automotive and industrial applications.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. So I'm correct. It was about double.\nBernie Blegen: I think also when we look at the modules business, that is taking off very nicely.\nMichael Hsing: The modules started with a smaller base, like a few hundred percent increase. That was $30 million, $40 million.\nWill Stein: And is the strength that you're seeing there at all related to the pull-ins and delivering against delinquencies that you had previously or is this part of the rest of the business? What I want to think of as core that might not have...\nMichael Hsing: No. It's a small part of it is due to delinquencies. I mean this is a new market segment. And people order from online and we never see those. I mean, it is not our own internet and our own Web site from our distributors and these are very small customers. They never all those parts before. And that's although the numbers is small, but the revenue is still small, but the large number of our customers and they use -- these are plug-and-play modules. And so what and they can just plug-in and they don't have to do any design. And since you mentioned the programming portion and that's part of what we learned that our customer doesn't even want to do programs. They want us to do it. And so we created virtual labs and customer tell us what they want and we show, in our labs, we program everything and then we ship. So now what we are talking about, it's really a custom design for each customer and that is taking off and I'm very glad to see it.\nWill Stein: And just a final comment there is on the modules, they're not necessarily tied to any one end market. They're actually very broad-based, initially, we thought that they would be plug-and-play solutions, particularly for prototyping or small volumes, but it turns out that they're actually going to mainstream production.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. And so that's something we learned and I'm a former engineering. I'm skilled engineer, our people and we created a great product that we see it and we're reporting like 30 parameters, 70 parameters on the Web site. They can program it and they can see what the result from simulations. And it turned out to be and we put a lot there nobody looking at it and we're wondering why. So we reduced to half and then we cut another half the reduced to five, six, seven, they still don't want to see it. And they want to pick the numbers in a total, you do that for me and that's great. We can do the work, they pay for it. That's fine.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton from Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.\nQuinn Bolton: Just wanted to see if you might be able to give us an update on your efforts in the GPU space for either desktop or data center GPUs. Just looking at the power consumption of those devices, I think you're seeing desktop GPUs now consuming up to 300 watts. I think data center, maybe up to 400 watts. You guys, I think I talked about that back at Analyst Day as a potential opportunity. Just wondering if you're starting to see any real traction or if you start to need in the curve on either the sort of the gaming or the data center side of GPUs.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. We're seeing substantial movement on both. We probably started out earlier on the desktop, where we started generating revenues with this about 18 months to two years ago. And now we're moving into the data center where we actually are starting to ramp and in particular, 48 volt for artificial intelligence. So the opportunities are significant, but we're still at the very early stages of this market. So fundamentally, we're very well positioned, but it's still going to be another year or two before we still -- we move the dial with revenue ramp.\nMichael Hsing: Those are AR, Bernie is talking about, these are over 1,000 watts, and it's not 200 or 300 or 400-watt levels. If you get to that high level, you're only talking about only a few companies, they can supply those types of product. Again, in I think we are in good positions and -- but always can be better.\nGenevieve Cunningham:  There appear to be no further questions. I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.\nBernie Blegen: Great. Thanks, Gen. I would like to thank you all for joining us for this conference and look forward to talking to you again about our fourth quarter results which will likely be in early February. Thank you and have a nice day.",

            "name": "Bernie Blegen",
            "content": "Thanks, Gen. MPS achieved record third quarter revenue of $259.4 million, 39.3% higher than revenue in the second quarter of 2020, and 53.7% higher than the comparable quarter in 2019. As noted in our September 14, 2020 update to our Q3 financial guidance, our revenue increased beyond expectations for two key reasons; first, we were able to fulfill our customers' demand that had been delinquent due to past capacity constraints; second, certain China-based customers requested previously scheduled shipment dates be pulled into the third quarter of 2020. We believe this request was related to trade and regulatory policy changes that occurred during the quarter. These two factors contributed significantly to this quarter's performance relative to the prior quarter of 2020 and to Q3 of 2019. Looking at our revenue by market. Third quarter 2020 communications revenue of $54.7 million was up 81.8% from the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to a pull-in of customers requested ship dates. Communications sales represented 21.1% of our total third quarter 2020 revenue. In our consumer markets, third quarter 2020 revenue of $70.2 million increased 47.4% from revenue reported for the prior quarter of 2020. This extraordinary growth in consumer reflects a combination of market share gains in gaming, wearables and IoT applications along with normal seasonality. Consumer revenue represented 27.1% of our third quarter 2020 revenue. In our computing and storage market, third quarter revenue of $75.3 million increased $11.2 million or 17.5% from the second quarter of 2020. The sequential quarterly revenue growth was broad-based with sales gains recorded in high-end notebooks, servers and storage. Computing and storage revenue represented 29% of MPS' third quarter 2020 revenue. Third quarter automotive revenue of $28.5 million grew $10.7 million or 60.4% over the second quarter of 2020. This improvement reflects a more normal ordering level following the Q2 2020 industrywide slowdown resulting from the pandemic. We believe MPS' market share will continue to expand in the coming years as we have been awarded multiple design wins in infotainment, smart lighting, ADAS and autonomous driving. Automotive revenue was 11.0% of MPS' total third quarter 2020 revenue. Third quarter 2020 industrial revenue of $30.7 million increased 15.3% from the second quarter of 2020, due primarily to increased revenue for power sources and industrial meters. Industrial revenue represented 11.8% of our total third quarter 2020 revenue. GAAP gross margin was 55.1%, matching the second quarter of 2020 and 10 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2019. Our GAAP operating income was $60.0 million compared to $28.0 million reported in the second quarter of 2020 and $30.0 million reported in the third quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 55.5%, 20 basis points below the gross margin reported for the second quarter of 2020 and 10 basis points lower than the third quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $84.9 million compared to $53.0 million reported in the prior quarter and $51.4 million reported in the third quarter of 2019. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $83.1 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared with $74.6 million in the second quarter of 2020 and $63.1 million in the third quarter of 2019. Our non-GAAP third quarter 2020 operating expenses were $59.1 million, up from the $50.7 million we spent in the second quarter of 2020 and up from the $42.5 million reported in the third quarter of 2019. The sequential increase in Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses primarily reflected higher variable costs associated with the increase in revenue and an increased level of investment in securing foundry capacity. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense, an income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the third quarter of 2020, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $707,000 charged to cost of goods sold was $23.0 million compared with $21.0 million recorded in the second quarter of 2020. Switching to the bottom-line. Third quarter 2020 GAAP net income was $55.6 million or $1.18 per fully diluted share compared with $30.2 million or $0.64 per share in the second quarter of 2020 and $29.5 million or $0.64 per share in the third quarter of 2019. Q3 non-GAAP net income was $79.4 million or $1.69 per fully diluted share compared with $50.6 million or $1.08 per share in the second quarter of 2020 and $49.5 million or $1.08 per share in the third quarter of 2019. Fully diluted shares at the end of Q3 2020 were $47.0 million. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $554.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 2020 compared to $515.4 million at the end of the second quarter of 2020. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $77.4 million compared with Q2 2020 operating cash flow of $59.3 million. Third quarter 2020 capital spending totaled $19.6 million. Accounts receivable ended the third quarter of 2020 at $93.5 million representing 33 days of sales outstanding which was six days higher than the 27 days reported at the end of the second quarter of 2020 and two days higher than the 31 days at the end of the third quarter of 2019. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2020 were $148.1 million, down from the $152.1 million at the end of the second quarter of 2020. Days of inventory of 116 days at the end of the third quarter 2020 were 50 days lower than at the end of the second quarter of 2020. The sequential drop in days inventory on hand represented an anomaly due to a decrease in the dollar value of inventory and a 39% increase in quarterly revenue. Currently, our inventory levels are lean. We are working very hard to return inventory to the 180 to 200-day level necessary to support our future growth. I would now like to turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of 2020. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $218 million to $230 million. We also expect the following; GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.1% to 55.7%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.4% to 56.0%; total stock-based compensation expense of $21.8 million to $23.8 million, including approximately $700,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold; GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $81.3 million and $85.3 million; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $60.2 million to $62.2 million; litigation expense should range between $1.8 million to $2.2 million; interest income is expected to range from $1.0 million to $1.4 million; fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.1 million to 48.1 million shares. In conclusion, we will monitor market conditions closely and continue to execute. I'll now open the webinar up for questions. Tore, thanks for commenting on the $1 billion run rate. Yes, if you compare ourselves against Q3, obviously, that was a high watermark. So probably a more relevant comparison is against Q4 of 2019. And on that basis, we're expecting all of our major markets to be up significantly from the prior year. And then, when you do the comparison against Q3, you'll see that there'll probably be declines in communications and computing and also in consumer, the consumer is seasonally adjusted but we'll still expect to see improvements in industrial and automotive. Sure. I think as we acknowledged in Q3 that we were able to catch up as far as having adequate capacity in order to service near-term demand and in giving guidance for Q4 that expectation follows along. When we look ahead over the course of the next 24 months, we previously mentioned that we're entering into new relationships with other fabs and expect to grow our overall capacity. So this will be an ongoing investment that we would project for at least about the next six quarters. The previous metrics that we had been using were about 20 days lower, but we've really made this change as far as what we've been trying to explain to the analysts and to investors over the course of about the last two to three quarters. But nonetheless, I do want to address your question, which is in order for us to sustain the level of growth that we have in excess of our market, the industry that we have to have a higher level of inventory, so in other words, there is a mismatch. In other words, we are building the inventory today, but we're not going to -- for the sales that will occur one or two quarters out. And so it's not a perfect reflection for other companies where they're not growing as fast. They can maintain lower levels in terms of days, but here, again, we have to make an incremental investment in order to allow to support our growth. Sure. And I think that you captured it very well is that obviously, our model has been to improve gross margin 10 to 20 basis points sequentially. Now a lot of factors weigh into being able to deliver against those results, including both our mix of business as well as what the market looks like. So again, you have to use these as guidelines, not as an absolute guarantee of what our performance will look like. And then, on the operating expenses, right now, we are going to be continuing to invest in capacity as I said in each of the next six quarters. So that will be an additional layer of investment from what we've seen and so as a result we're not projecting our operating margins to improve significantly over the course of the next two years. Yes. And if I can just add to that is that. I really think that there are certain aspects of our business that we have in good control, as Michael hit on as far as the design wind activity, but right now, we do not have control over what the end customer demand is ultimately going to be about. So I think that as far as executing against our strategy and seeing it show up in our results, I think we're going to continue along that path but there are just too many factors for us, it would be pure speculation at this point. And I think what we're seeing here is that, as I said, in the guidance that we offered is it anticipates both the demand, including the backlog that we had coming into the quarter and it's matched with what our supply chain and capacity limits are. So I guess that I would probably offer that we have some ability for upside, but it's going to be a little bit limited by supply chain. I would probably say that automotive is one of the more exciting end markets for us for the next several years. Now if you look at our track record in 2019 and 2020, 2019 was affected by the recession, 2020 by factory closings related to the COVID-19 pandemic. So again, those are circumstances that were largely outside of our control. But what we're seeing is that we're expanding now from our traditional infotainment base into some of these more exciting technologies, including the lighting systems, the ADAS and the autonomous driving. So we think that this is a sustainable revenue growth should be well ahead of what our corporate average is going to be. At one time, we were promoting the concept of being able to grow consistently at 20% to 60% per year, but that would probably back off of that down to a more reasonable between 30% and 40%, but still a very exciting end market for us. But I think you go back to what our competitive basis is, and it really is that we're winning with superior technology and a higher level of customer service and I think that's what our customers are recognizing as far. And I think that in the past, securing fab capacity and being able to introduce new products at the rate that we are is really nothing new to MPS. But the scale has been getting bigger and so that's why the investments and the time that we have to plan ahead makes a difference. And so all we're doing is preparing both for the capacity but also recognizing acknowledging the investment that goes with it. We have so much other news. I didn't know that there's an even higher arching strategy here where e-commerce is a significant part of and it's really how do you go after underserved customers. And what was surprising to me is, we did look at the last three years as far as how many customers did we have that were under $100,000 and how is that base growing. Because if you can use the linear model, where what they used to do is get in there early... ..linear technology, getting there early and then develop these long-term relationships and then you grow with their growth. And so as a part of that strategy, I think we're -- the numbers I looked at, we're doing a very good job. They're starting to bear dividends. Yes. High-performance analog, yes. This is prototyping. Yes. The eMotion is right in that sort of transition phase because we have a lot of design wins that are going in. So last year, the revenue run rate was somewhere in the $10 million to $12 million, but now the doubling is going to start, particularly as we go into both automotive and industrial applications. I think also when we look at the modules business, that is taking off very nicely. Yes. We're seeing substantial movement on both. We probably started out earlier on the desktop, where we started generating revenues with this about 18 months to two years ago. And now we're moving into the data center where we actually are starting to ramp and in particular, 48 volt for artificial intelligence. So the opportunities are significant, but we're still at the very early stages of this market. So fundamentally, we're very well positioned, but it's still going to be another year or two before we still -- we move the dial with revenue ramp. Great. Thanks, Gen. I would like to thank you all for joining us for this conference and look forward to talking to you again about our fourth quarter results which will likely be in early February. Thank you and have a nice day."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Michael Hsing",
            "content": "Let me add. As you remember, end of the last year and we are at around 200 days of inventory. If we use that model and to meet this year growth, that probably -- that's about the right numbers. That's the basis that's where this 20 more days come from. And so if you go to a little more details and MPS is a fabulous company, and yet, we have own technologies. This is very unique. I can't think of any of our competitors, they're in the same way of manufacturing and they do to fulfill their manufacturing. Most of them, they have their own fab. And so given the volatilities and also given the growth that we have and also number of product and address all the greenfield market segment, we need probably more than 200 days inventories. Let me answer that question. If you're talking about normal seasonality then the outlook is great. And we have so many design in activities and we see so many award projects and as well as you know as well as I know, these were in unprecedented era, pandemics and geopolitical issues and I can't predict and frankly, I care less. Well, as the December quarter -- go into December quarters, we are still facing delinquencies. So the capacity is still limited. Bernie  talking. Okay. Frankly, I don't have clear pictures. And what's the growth? Frankly, I never put MPS' as we have to grow a certain percentage, okay? And what I'm looking at it is, what kind of product, which project and how well we're positioned and which customers, which projects we want designing. And a lot more importantly, okay, what kind of products in the pipeline. That really drives the top line. And so how we predicted what's the next lowest growth percentage, I can't tell you. Well, we had a lot of pulling from Q3 and partially in Q4. As I said earlier, we're still facing delinquencies. And so I think that's a combination of the growth and also in a capacity shortage from that past. Okay. Well, if the market slows down, we're going to get there quickly. Again, and this is -- we're at uncomfortable levels. I can meet that. And so we want to increase as much as we can. And now our engineers working the fabs, okay, working at the different fabs and to get the -- to qualify the process and technologies. And so, we hope that in the next six months, we can catch up. Yes. Okay. The first question is, yes, absolutely, okay. We said earlier this year, we expanded another 12-inch fab, wasn't in our plan, but we hurried up and get that thing going. And we start shipping product in Q3. That's unprecedented and thanks to our people. And they really worked in day and night to manage and qualify these products. Going forward, we just want to expand the capacity to reach 180 to 200 days inventory. And going in the future, if we have a very linear world and then it is very easy to calculate. I think we are living in a very non-linear environment and 200 days inventory, that's what we want to do. Our ASPs increasing and when we move to high-end market segments. And so, our competitions are always pretty similar. I mean our customer doesn't even know MPS' is $1 billion. There are no MPS. MPS is very small potatoes against all these giants. That's right, yes. Yes. Okay. Obviously, the $1.2 billion is not enough. And if you want to building a fast on the 200 days inventories, it's more than double it right now. So that's what we try to do and it's not easy and that's what we're aiming for, just double it. I'm sorry, I wasn't clear. We're shooting for $2 billion. I think 5G overall at an early stage. And all I can say now that we engage with all the 5G station makers. And we do have a designing activity and we do have award projects but it's not significant revenue yet. If the market slows down, we're going to do that next quarter. If the demand is still that strong, we continue to face that. And we see some not as bad as last quarters -- last two quarters. Well, Huawei is not our supplier. But SMIC, it is our supplier. So far, it's not affecting us, and we don't know. We can't speculate, what does all these policy means that came in. But on the other hand and we diversified our foundry sources. We're starting from a beginning of this year. We speed it up. Well, we can say zero or some non-zero, and so far, we cannot ship. But there is other rules and regulations coming out and all the other permits, I mean, we cannot speculating or what kind of things we can do and it's all depending on our government now. Well, as I said, the world is not linear. And I remember and I was facing a lot of, I was facing a lot of questions about when our model is like a 20% to 25% growth rate. In 2016, 2017 or 2015, 2016 and we will criticize you will never get there, although we're somewhere around 17%, 18%. And you asked so many times, you forced me say it at the time. I think around 2016, I said that -- but 2018, 2019, we're going to get it over 20%. And that comment is pulling off from my ears, this is not a science. I mean in a non-linear world, it's very difficult to predict. And so I said earlier, we only can anticipate it and by staffing the inventories and by stock inventories. And just get ready, and of course, and the world crashes. Of course, we're not we're going to start to depleting inventories. And we're not building as many as much and so we can modulate the inside a little bit. But for the growth rate, I see all these designing activities and all these projects, I will say last couple of years is better than two, three years before. And we awarded a lot more high-value products, high-value sockets. We didn't prepare the numbers. We're doing really good. And I thought that there was nobody going to ask the question because... It is okay. I feel, I can say, we've figured out the way to do it. And so until we prove ourselves wrong again. The new website as I think you see it. It's very different and we increased a whole lot more clicks and the customers stay on the pages for a lot longer. And also, we're creating a virtual labs and that part also helps the e-commerce. So we don't have the product FAEs and have them pounding the payment to generate opportunities and we're using the Web site. And the numbers and the increase by increased weekly and I'm very pleased and so we're talking about a few hundred percentage increase from a small number. It doesn't mean a lot, but for us and we learned it. That's the trick. That's the area we're going to do. We're going to enhance that. The linear technology. We increased these number like three or four times. And from a small base. And that is a significant and it has happened in the last few years. And now clearly, we can put the metrics. And so, an old saying is that, what you measure what you get. And we know how -- start to know how to -- what to measure and that's to me, is very important. But I'm looking at the revenue-wise, it became meaningful, but I don't have clear details. I don't want to have a pull out my higher numbers. Finding good people as always hard. All these good company that keep the good people and that's always a challenge. And so we know that we need a diversified. And that came in a lot of times in the last 10, 15 years or more likely the last 20 years. We have a lot of people from China came in. And now two or four, five years ago, we migrated to Europe and the Taiwan and outside of the Mainland China. Now in the last couple of years, it will come back to U.S., and we do see, not necessarily in the Bay Area but other parts of the countries, we do find some talents there. The converters, which... Oh, yes. The data converters. Okay. Yes. Okay. I think we received the first chip. Yes. And I think we're building solutions and as most of the time, the first chip will have some bugs, it's  and we are building a prototype. We still can't put in a system yet now. Yes. I think we use that e-commerce platform to promote those products. And that eMotion side, I think the revenues, I had to say some number now otherwise I don't know whether you guys think of whether I do have numbers. I want to have Bernie's. Sometimes it increase almost double. The motion side. Yes. So I'm correct. It was about double. The modules started with a smaller base, like a few hundred percent increase. That was $30 million, $40 million. No. It's a small part of it is due to delinquencies. I mean this is a new market segment. And people order from online and we never see those. I mean, it is not our own internet and our own Web site from our distributors and these are very small customers. They never all those parts before. And that's although the numbers is small, but the revenue is still small, but the large number of our customers and they use -- these are plug-and-play modules. And so what and they can just plug-in and they don't have to do any design. And since you mentioned the programming portion and that's part of what we learned that our customer doesn't even want to do programs. They want us to do it. And so we created virtual labs and customer tell us what they want and we show, in our labs, we program everything and then we ship. So now what we are talking about, it's really a custom design for each customer and that is taking off and I'm very glad to see it. Yes. And so that's something we learned and I'm a former engineering. I'm skilled engineer, our people and we created a great product that we see it and we're reporting like 30 parameters, 70 parameters on the Web site. They can program it and they can see what the result from simulations. And it turned out to be and we put a lot there nobody looking at it and we're wondering why. So we reduced to half and then we cut another half the reduced to five, six, seven, they still don't want to see it. And they want to pick the numbers in a total, you do that for me and that's great. We can do the work, they pay for it. That's fine. Those are AR, Bernie is talking about, these are over 1,000 watts, and it's not 200 or 300 or 400-watt levels. If you get to that high level, you're only talking about only a few companies, they can supply those types of product. Again, in I think we are in good positions and -- but always can be better."

Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for one year on our Investor Relations page at www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. During this webinar, we will discuss our Q2 2020 financial results and guidance for Q3 2020, followed by a Q&A session. Analysts you are currently muted. [Operator Instructions] In the course of today's webinar, we will be making forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and, other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release and in our SEC filings including our Form 10-K filed on February 28th, 2020 and our Form 10-Q filed on May 11th, 2020, which are accessible through our website www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D, and SG&A expense, operating income, interest, and other income, net income, and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q2 2019, Q1 2020, and Q2 2020 releases, as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.\nBernie Blegen: Thanks Gen. MPS achieved record second quarter revenue of $186.2 million, 12.3% higher than the first quarter of 2020 and 23.3% higher than the comparable quarter in 2019. Second quarter revenue growth was broad-based except for automotive. Our strong year-over-year revenue growth for 2020, in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic, was a result of our diversified growth strategy and our technological innovation. Maintaining this level of superior performance and realizing future growth opportunities requires us to step up investments in capacity, infrastructure, quality assurance, and headcount. We are also expanding our operating capabilities outside China. Turning now to our second quarter 2020 revenue by market. Second quarter computing and storage revenue of $64.1 million increased $12.1 million or 23.3% from the first quarter of 2020. Computing and storage revenue represented 34.4% of MPS' second quarter revenue. The sequential revenue increase reflected strength in storage revenue along with increased notebook revenue. Second quarter server revenue maintained the elevated levels achieved in the first quarter of 2020 and server revenue was significantly higher than the second quarter of the prior year. Second quarter consumer revenue of $47.7 million increased 27.4% from the first quarter of 2020 and represented 25.6% of our second quarter 2020 revenue. The sequential quarterly revenue increase reflected improved sales of products for home applications, IOT, gaming consoles, and VOT, a new acronym which stands for a Variety of Things. Second quarter 2020 communications revenue of $30.1 million was up by 8.0% from the first quarter of 2020. Product sales for communications infrastructure, including 5G networking increased sequentially as did sales of legacy router and wireless applications. Communications sales represented 16.2% of our total second quarter 2020 revenue. Second quarter industrial revenue of $26.6 million, increased 5.4% from the first quarter of 2020, as increased revenue for power sources more than offset a decrease in security based product sales. Industrial revenue represented 14.3% of our total second quarter 2020 revenue. Second quarter automotive revenue of $17.8 million, fell 23.7% from the first quarter of 2020, as the number of automotive OEMs shut down production for most of the quarter in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The range of applications MPS and encompasses now includes infotainment, smart lighting, ADAS and autonomous driving. Again, we believe MPS is well positioned to accelerate growth in automotive when the market returns. Automotive revenue was 9.5% of MPS' total second quarter 2020 revenue. I should point out that despite the past four months of COVID-related travel restrictions, our design activities remain largely unimpacted by the pandemic and have exceeded our expectations across the board. We have seen solid engagement particularly with top tier customers. These new and continuing customer relationships position MPS for long-term success in these critical markets. GAAP gross margin was 55.1%, 10 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2020 and flat compared with the second quarter of 2019. Our GAAP operating income was $28.0 million compared to $31.0 million reported in the first quarter of 2020 and $20.1 million reported in the second quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 55.7%, up 20 basis points from the gross margin reported in the first quarter of 2020 and 10 basis points higher than the second quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $53.0 million compared to $45.9 million reported in the prior quarter and $43.7 million reported in the second quarter of 2019. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $74.6 million in the second quarter of 2020, compared with $60.5 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $63.1 million in the second quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP second quarter 2020 operating expenses were $50.7 million, up from the $46.1 million we spent in the first quarter of 2020, and up from the $40.3 million reported in the second quarter of 2019. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarter as discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the second quarter of 2020, total stock compensation expense including approximately $642,000 charged to cost of goods sold was $21.0 million, compared with the $18.6 million recorded in the first quarter of 2020. Switching to the bottom line. Second quarter 2020 GAAP net income was $30.2 million, or $0.64 per fully diluted share compared with $35.8 million, or $0.77 per share in the first quarter of 2020 and $20.7 million, or $0.45 per share in the second quarter of 2019. Q2 non-GAAP net income was $50.6 million, or $1.08 per fully diluted share, compared with $44.3 million, or $0.95 per share in the first quarter of 2020, and $41.9 million, or $0.92 per share in the second quarter of 2019. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q2 2020 were $46.8 million. Now, let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $515.4 million at the end of second quarter of 2020, compared to $492 million at the end of the first quarter of 2020. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $59.3 million, compared with Q1 2020 operating cash flow of $51.4 million. Second quarter 2020 capital spending totaled $14.6 million. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter of 2020 at $55.1 million, representing 27 days of sales outstanding, which was three days lower than the 30 days reported at the end of the first quarter of 2020 and six days lower than the 33 days in the second quarter of 2019. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter of 2020 were $152.1 million, up from the $131.5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2020. Days of inventory of 166 days at the end of the second quarter of 2020 were five days higher than at the end of the first quarter of 2020. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2020. As we are still in the midst of COVID pandemic, demand visibility for the remainder of the year is not as crisp as we usually see at this point in the year. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in the range of $200 million to $210 million. We also expect the following; GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.2% to 55.8%, non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.5% to 56.1%, total stock-based compensation expense of $21.2 million to $23.2 million including approximately $700,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses should be between $70.7 million and $74.7 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses should be in the range of $50.2 million to $52.2 million. Litigation expense should range between $1.8 million and $2.2 million, interest income is expected to range from $1.5 million to $1.7 million, and fully diluted shares to be in the range of 46.5 million to 47.5 million shares. In conclusion, we continue to grow year-over-year. We are excited about our design activities in the pipeline and expanding our reach in the new frontiers. I will now open the webinar for questions.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie. Analyst, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.\nTore Svanberg: Yes, thank you. Michael and Bernie congratulations on another very strong quarter. Before I get into the near-term stuff, you did mention something at the beginning there that you are exploring some operations outside of China. I'm not talking about design centers here, but are you working on something else on the manufacturing side outside of China at this point?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. We try to expand another fab and we're exploring another 12-inch fabs, okay, as well as a 8-inch fab outside of China.\nTore Svanberg: Okay, very good. And as we look at the September quarter and congratulations on getting to $200 million in quarterly revenue, could you maybe talk a little bit about some of the end markets that's going to drive that growth? I mean, I'm sure the storage and server business is going to continue to remain strong. But maybe give us the puts and takes on each end market going into the September quarter?\nMichael Hsing: Yeah. Tore, our product is a very fundamental use of building blocks, okay? And we supply all these power to power management for all electronic devices and including automotive. And now one segment clearly in this pandemic and everybody knows the infrastructures for telecommunications and data centers and as well as IoTs and the PCs and they'll grow. And MPS okay just supply these are building blocks for all these segments. And as Bernie said earlier other than automotive all segments are doing well.\nBernie Blegen: Very broad based.\nMichael Hsing: Yeah.\nTore Svanberg: Very good. Just one last question. The DSO is pretty low now Bernie. And I mean, I assume that's just purely linearity. Anything else going on there?\nBernie Blegen: No. I think we've always had a very good track record with credit and collections and the 27 days in the quarter really is a reflection of how front-loaded the initial sales were in Q2.\nTore Svanberg: Congratulations again. Thank you.\nBernie Blegen: Thank you, Tore.\nMichael Hsing: Thank you. Tore.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton from Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.\nQuinn Bolton: Thank you, and let me echo my congratulations. I guess Bernie, you made some comments about visibility being a little bit less clear today than in years past, obviously COVID it's understandable with the COVID outbreak. But I guess you guys have had a very strong sort of first three quarters of the year including guidance for September. Just wondering can you talk to us about your thoughts on the sustainability of this demand? Or are there certain factors perhaps the game console ramp that may be leading to some particular strength in the September quarter that may soften seasonally as we look out beyond the September quarter? And then I've got a follow-up.\nBernie Blegen: Sure. I think that just given the nature of the current macro environment where we did benefit from accelerated ordering patterns, particularly in -- at the end of Q1 that we don't want to become complacent, because we have seen falloffs in demand after we've had a big run-up like we just experienced. So it isn't that we're seeing anything specifically in the market that causes us concern, but just past experience tells us that it's something that we have to monitor.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. The Bernie's comment was very similar to our statement in the Q1 and Q2, okay? We didn't -- we expect at the time that all segment will grow including automotive. And so what is the magnitude of the growth is to our surprise. And even during the first couple of quarters, we -- first quarter, we mentioned again we have more order than we can ship. And so now we're going to second half of this year's the macro conditions to us is not very much -- it's not unsettled. And so we will prepare to change quickly. And -- but overall orders are still very good.\nBernie Blegen: And one last thing just to follow-up on Michael's comment there is that in the beginning of the year, we did have concerns about supply chain capacity. And we've lowered that risk, but that's still an issue that is requiring ongoing management.\nQuinn Bolton: Understood. And then longer term, you mentioned you're positively surprised by the strength of the design activity particularly with Tier 1s. I'm sure you're not going to name customers, but are there a couple of applications you might be able to highlight for us that you're really excited about over the next year or two?\nMichael Hsing: It's -- a couple of them clearly is 48 volts and as we talk about it and the other one is in the data centers business. And also as Bernie mentioned earlier in automotive, we engaged with heavily and a lot of activity in ADAS.\nBernie Blegen: And I think to keep in mind that in a lot of the markets that Michael just listed is that, we are relatively small players. So we have a lot of upside greenfield opportunities that should continue to drive our growth for the next two to three years at least.\nQuinn Bolton: You bet.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Joshua Buchalter from Cowen. Joshua, your line is now open.\nJoshua Buchalter: Good day, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the results. I wanted to begin with storage and computing update. Given the size of the upside, I was a bit surprised to see server not called out as a driver of sequential growth. Could you maybe provide some granularity on was this a function of -- in 1Q was just such a high watermark? Or was there anything else going on within that market that allowed it to grow less than the other ones? Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Server growth is not a surprise to us. And we talk about it in the past quarters. And we expected a growth from -- say from a year ago. And this year we will grow substantially from last year. So there is no surprises. And so our product is as I remind everybody, it's still a power supply and we're powering up the CPUs and powering up all the electronics electronic devices using a server.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. And I think we tried to add some color to that in the prepared comments by saying that, we enjoyed a noteworthy step up between Q1 and Q2 or Q4 and Q1 and we maintain that same high level in Q2. So when you look at the year-over-year server is one of our largest year-over-year growth drivers.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from William Stein from SunTrust. William, your line is now open.\nWilliam Stein: Great, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on these very strong results. I'm wondering if Bernie you can talk to us about backlog versus turns expectations. I think last quarter we had this sort of special situation where you essentially guided for negative net turns, maybe you can confirm my recollection and clarify what guidance implies in that regard for Q3.\nBernie Blegen: I think that the term that we referred to at the end of Q1 was the toilet paper effect that there was an outsized ordering pattern in the last four weeks of March and so we had to take Q2 to more closely understand what that represented. And after we went customer-by-customer and geography to geography, we found out that there were a couple of drivers, well 3. The first was, that there was a increase stepped up increase in demand and particularly as it relates to work from home applications. And so that included storage and 5G and notebooks and then as I said earlier continued strong ordering within automotive. But there was also an acceleration of demand where the distributors and customers wanted to get in line to make sure that they were not. So what we've had to do is a very close evaluation to make sure that we don't let the channel inventories rise too much because of over-enthusiasm. But at this point, we enter this quarter again with a similar backlog profile, as we had last quarter meaning that there's low no reliance on turns business in order to meet our expectations.\nMichael Hsing: Yeah. Our assumption, the toilet paper effect wasn't quite right. There is very little, okay? And so the -- after we're diving and deeper into our customers, our distributors, and we found that these growths are real growth and somewhat is very sustainable.\nWilliam Stein: Okay, got it. So the elevated orders last quarter were not a sort of a trick, they were for real and it sounds like you're seeing elevated backlog this quarter as well. So, maybe the other -- the other side of this of course is supply. And so that's my second question. Bernie, through the quarter, you talked about how supply was -- the company was more able to deliver. We certainly saw that in the quarter. I think you talked about increased supply at one foundry having a doubling of capacity that's sort of real-time and then another expectation for a ramped in Q4, at maybe a new foundry from one of your existing partners. I think together, it sounded like that was 40% additional capacity, which suggests maybe up to two years of sort of runway. Maybe you could clarify, I think you -- on the call earlier you talked about two fabs that are ramping now. Maybe you can just clarify for us where we are and where you expect capacity to go over the next few quarters?\nBernie Blegen: Yeah. I think that to give full credit, our operations capabilities were put to the test in the early part of this year. And I think that, we responded as well as one could have expected. And most of the numbers that you cited as far as the capacity expansion are pretty close to the mark. I'm not going to confirm or reject them you're in the ballpark. And I think that, it remains an issue because as we look ahead our growth prospects for the next three to five years certainly are significant. And so what we're trying to do is get both capacity but then also get a geographically distributed. So, that's going to require a continuing level of investment, as we look ahead here for the next few years.\nWilliam Stein: Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: The next question is from Chris Caso from Raymond James. Chris, your line is now open.\nChris Caso: Yes. Thank you. Good evening. And congratulations on the pioneering conference call format, which seems working very well. So my first question is just a follow-on from the other question. And with respect to capacity and the constraints that you're under right now, do you foresee a situation over the next few quarters where those capacity constraints could be an impediment to revenue? I guess, from where we are right now and actually we're seeing -- it appears that we're seeing some good upside the toilet paper effect is not having the effect that we feared. Is there still sufficient headroom for revenue growth as we go through the next few quarters as you're putting these capacity plans in place?\nMichael Hsing: Yeah. Let's put that way, our production people and they're working at over 100%. And we still have more revenue that we can ship. I mean, we can order than more than we can ship. And as we increase the capacities in the last six months, the issues are much better now.\nBernie Blegen: And I would also probably just having learned from this recent experience that, we're more likely to also increase our internal inventories, so we don't have to rely upon necessarily in the moment production excellence.\nChris Caso: Great. As a follow-up, with regard to the compute segment, we've heard from some others is that the market itself -- I guess, there's some areas of the compute market which look like they'll be slowing as you go into the second half. There was some of that work from home demand. In notebooks, for example, it looks like it was pulled forward to the first half. Intel had talked about some of the data centers -- the cloud data center revenue, which maybe showing some decline after a number of strong quarters. I know you have a lot of content increase as well. And I guess the question is, if the market should slow, one, is that what you're seeing? And secondly, the extent of your content increases, are they greater than what's happening in the market?\nMichael Hsing: We are the new players. Okay? We are a relatively small player in the market segment. And we don't see -- for our revenue growth we don't see any slowdown. And as we become a much bigger percentage then we can answer your question better.\nChris Caso: Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from David Williams from Loop Capital. David, your line is now open. We'll move to the next question. This comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.\nMelissa Weathers: Hi, guys. This is Melissa on for Ross. Thank you for letting us ask a question and congratulations on a really strong quarter. I was hoping to get your opinion on the automotive end market specifically. Your larger peers were also impacted by the factory shutdowns around the world. As you're thinking about the recovery in the second half, how do you see this business recovering? And I know you don't guide more than one quarter out, but can you help us understand how sales into auto will resume?\nBernie Blegen: Yes. I think that Q3 we're going to see a restabilization in the market. Interestingly, even though the manufacturing of the OEMs was shut down for two to three months, people still continue to buy cars. So there is some pent-up demand that they need to meet. But I think that the ramp may not be -- it won't necessarily snap back, I'm expecting to see some additional improvement in Q4, as they start to roll out the new model year. But I don't see it being the stair-step growth that we've experienced in past years.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question will come from David Williams from Loop Capital. David, your line is now open.\nDavid Williams: Perfect. Thank you. And thanks for letting me ask a question and congrats on the quarter. I guess the first question is really around the gaming console. And maybe if you could provide any color around the benefit in the quarter from the gaming console and then maybe how that layers into the remainder of the year.\nBernie Blegen: I think that the gaming console is a very -- a somewhat predictable business, as far as there's almost a bell-shaped curve that occurs over five months beginning in June and ending in October. So that is pretty heavily weighted towards Q3 for what we sell into. And right now the visibility will not be crisp, is the word we used before, probably until late August or early September. Though, right now, we seem to be tracking very well against our expectations.\nDavid Williams: Okay. So you'd characterize that as maybe stable to towards your expectations?\nBernie Blegen: Yes. Stable is not a word I normally assigned to gaming consoles, because it does create this bubble which has certain of its own management challenges. But, yes, I would say, that the demand is meeting our expectations and we have adequate supply chain to handle it.\nDavid Williams: Great. And then maybe thinking about the data center and maybe from the computing, how much of this do you think is maybe pull ahead versus more cycle related? Do you think this is sustainable? I realize you're a smaller player, but do you think you're seeing any pull ahead here? Or do you think all of this is maybe natural demand that would have come through pandemic or not?\nBernie Blegen: No. I think the work from home phenomena is real and at some level, we are able to quantify it. But I do think that it is a more front-end loaded cycle as we sort of offered an earlier response. And the only thing to really add is that we're such a small player and this is sort of our first opportunity to really experience accelerated revenue growth, again our visibility and predictability is a little bit low for us right now.\nDavid Williams: Great. Thank you so much.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.\nRick Schafer: Thank you. Nice job, guys. I guess my first question now we've talked about or ask on 5G yet. So maybe -- I don't know if you could give a sort of progress on the 5G entry how are things [Technical Difficulty] the largest customer there. I know there's been some uncertainty. I know the government here has been trend you with that [Technical Difficulty] And then I didn't know if you can you talk about how many would be into shipping now? Or do you just [Technical Difficulty] and then I have a follow-up.\nMichael Hsing: Rick, your question is barely audible and barely interpretable. We can try it okay try to answer your questions. And 5G is our biggest -- one of the biggest opportunities and very highly concentrated customers. And as you know, the 4G we were not in that and we don't have any revenues. Okay, very little revenues. And now we became a significant player in there and that's because our technologies. And as far as where to grow and which regions? Clearly, China is emphasize it and the Huawei is the biggest players now. So all the other regions we engage with them deeply. And but I have to say they're much slower. And what is the impact for our future business? I believe it's a matter of time. The longer the times and the longer time give us it will be actually better for MPS. And all the other players and had the familiar with MPS and familiar with the MPS technologies. And the time is actually is on our side, but it may affect the revenues. But in China, we see it keep growing in a 5G network.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Kamil Mielczarek from William Blair. Kamil, your line is now open.\nKamil Mielczarek: Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. First is I just want to follow-up on 5G. Can you provide some detail on how to think about the content you have and specifically the potential SAM given your POL products can be used in transceivers, base stations, fiber optic networks and back-end data centers. And I assume there's a potential for QSMOD as well?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. You're absolutely, right. Our opportunity we don't have a clear picture because again our product there is a very fundamental in us supplying powers and doing power management for each component. And it's really a rough calculation it's more than $40, $50 per stations.\nKamil Mielczarek: That's great. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up. How should we think about your entrance into the HPA market? I believe you are initially targeting medical and communication applications. And what's your differentiation versus competitors like TI? And lastly is this a 2021 revenue event?\nBernie Blegen: The primary competition is really with ADI and this is the advanced analog. And you're exactly correct that the first opportunity that we're pursuing is actually with a customer and they've provided us their spec and we would expect to be able to have a product that can be prototyped by the end of this year and have initial revenue after that. As far as the longer-term road map, we talked about communications because it is the next targeted market that were high-performance analog.\nMichael Hsing: Data converters. I missed the first part of the question. Okay. Go ahead.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. So just finishing up where the need for high-frequency and high precision. And as I said there's only one or two other players out there. It's a very difficult market to penetrate. But here again, we believe, we're very well positioned to move into it over the course of the next three to five years.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. Just a follow-up. And Michael, I'm asking this question because I really respect your view and if you look at Maxim, Linear, ADI, they've been competitors of yours for many years, whether for business or for engineers. They're now all going to be under one umbrella. What do you think that means for the analog space and perhaps for Monolithic power specifically?\nMichael Hsing: Well, thanks for saying you respect me. Yes, I think, it's the same the Maxim and Linear Technologies they are very proven and companies and they competed as -- in the past competes with them and MPS has a little bit agile and in terms of technology development and the product development. So our growth is faster. And I think going to futures MPS now has become meaningful players. And we are -- and if you look at the Linear Technologies with our $1.1 billion the MPS is very close to it. And so our customers were looking for a second of multiple suppliers. And with the superior technologies I think that will give us more opportunities.\nTore Svanberg: Very good. Congrats again.\nMichael Hsing: Thank you. Yes.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Kevin Garrigan from Rosenblatt. Kevin, your line is now open.\nKevin Garrigan: Guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. Just a quick one for me. Can you give us a little color on your e-commerce business? I know with everything kind of virtual now in your recent agreement with Farnell Electronics, can you kind of talk about what's going on there?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Okay. That's the e-commerce glad that you still remember that. And I have to say it's very slow okay, but I really believe that okay. I firmly believe that. We see some initial results. And after -- if you follow our website and our website change keep evolving. And up to a point now we know how do we double or triple the subscribers. And it's actually more than tripled and small start with small numbers. And so we're still doing a lot of surveys. And now I think the website is good enough and that we can work with our partners and online partners and distribute the message more -- much more clearly. And I will see in next few months and we'll see -- I hope to see a lot more result. But overall, we still believe it. And we much believe it in the plug and play solution, it will happen and online distribution, online sales, online configurations that will be the future. And so, for MPS opportunities instead of dollar, sub dollar parts, now, we're selling against $4, $5 or beyond for each component. So, the opportunities still remain and we are still learning.\nKevin Garrigan: Got it. Thanks guys.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton from Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.\nQuinn Bolton: Hey great. Thanks for letting me ask the follow question. Michael, you said some of the applications you're most excited about or center around the data center as well as 48 volts, so just a couple of follow-on questions. With NVIDIA's latest 7-nanometer generation of GPUs going into the data center, wondering if you're able to comment whether you're supplying any power management devices for that new 100 GPU either in a 12-volt or 48-volt SKU? And then longer term, as we look forward to the new Intel VR 14 spec, do you have a sense how much of that market might be 12-volt versus 48-volt? Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: All right. Okay. Obviously, we don't mention customers' names and customers' project names. And let's put that way, so, all the 48-volt product that we have a product in it. And in terms of the VR 14 spec, we have a reference design in that. And MPS will be compared via 13s and we're also a small part of it. And I think, the opportunity for MPS. And it became a significant play as a main player in the VR 14 in the next few years.\nBernie Blegen: Both in the 12-volt as well as 48-volt.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, for the 12 volts and 48 volts, my belief is mostly still 12 volts. And 48 volts, the application is still limited.\nQuinn Bolton: Great. Thank you for that color.\nGenevieve Cunningham: [Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.\nBernie Blegen: Great. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this webinar. And look forward to talking to you again during our third quarter webinar, which will likely be at the end of October. Thank you and have a great day.",

            "content": "Thanks Gen. MPS achieved record second quarter revenue of $186.2 million, 12.3% higher than the first quarter of 2020 and 23.3% higher than the comparable quarter in 2019. Second quarter revenue growth was broad-based except for automotive. Our strong year-over-year revenue growth for 2020, in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic, was a result of our diversified growth strategy and our technological innovation. Maintaining this level of superior performance and realizing future growth opportunities requires us to step up investments in capacity, infrastructure, quality assurance, and headcount. We are also expanding our operating capabilities outside China. Turning now to our second quarter 2020 revenue by market. Second quarter computing and storage revenue of $64.1 million increased $12.1 million or 23.3% from the first quarter of 2020. Computing and storage revenue represented 34.4% of MPS' second quarter revenue. The sequential revenue increase reflected strength in storage revenue along with increased notebook revenue. Second quarter server revenue maintained the elevated levels achieved in the first quarter of 2020 and server revenue was significantly higher than the second quarter of the prior year. Second quarter consumer revenue of $47.7 million increased 27.4% from the first quarter of 2020 and represented 25.6% of our second quarter 2020 revenue. The sequential quarterly revenue increase reflected improved sales of products for home applications, IOT, gaming consoles, and VOT, a new acronym which stands for a Variety of Things. Second quarter 2020 communications revenue of $30.1 million was up by 8.0% from the first quarter of 2020. Product sales for communications infrastructure, including 5G networking increased sequentially as did sales of legacy router and wireless applications. Communications sales represented 16.2% of our total second quarter 2020 revenue. Second quarter industrial revenue of $26.6 million, increased 5.4% from the first quarter of 2020, as increased revenue for power sources more than offset a decrease in security based product sales. Industrial revenue represented 14.3% of our total second quarter 2020 revenue. Second quarter automotive revenue of $17.8 million, fell 23.7% from the first quarter of 2020, as the number of automotive OEMs shut down production for most of the quarter in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The range of applications MPS and encompasses now includes infotainment, smart lighting, ADAS and autonomous driving. Again, we believe MPS is well positioned to accelerate growth in automotive when the market returns. Automotive revenue was 9.5% of MPS' total second quarter 2020 revenue. I should point out that despite the past four months of COVID-related travel restrictions, our design activities remain largely unimpacted by the pandemic and have exceeded our expectations across the board. We have seen solid engagement particularly with top tier customers. These new and continuing customer relationships position MPS for long-term success in these critical markets. GAAP gross margin was 55.1%, 10 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2020 and flat compared with the second quarter of 2019. Our GAAP operating income was $28.0 million compared to $31.0 million reported in the first quarter of 2020 and $20.1 million reported in the second quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 55.7%, up 20 basis points from the gross margin reported in the first quarter of 2020 and 10 basis points higher than the second quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $53.0 million compared to $45.9 million reported in the prior quarter and $43.7 million reported in the second quarter of 2019. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $74.6 million in the second quarter of 2020, compared with $60.5 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $63.1 million in the second quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP second quarter 2020 operating expenses were $50.7 million, up from the $46.1 million we spent in the first quarter of 2020, and up from the $40.3 million reported in the second quarter of 2019. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarter as discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the second quarter of 2020, total stock compensation expense including approximately $642,000 charged to cost of goods sold was $21.0 million, compared with the $18.6 million recorded in the first quarter of 2020. Switching to the bottom line. Second quarter 2020 GAAP net income was $30.2 million, or $0.64 per fully diluted share compared with $35.8 million, or $0.77 per share in the first quarter of 2020 and $20.7 million, or $0.45 per share in the second quarter of 2019. Q2 non-GAAP net income was $50.6 million, or $1.08 per fully diluted share, compared with $44.3 million, or $0.95 per share in the first quarter of 2020, and $41.9 million, or $0.92 per share in the second quarter of 2019. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q2 2020 were $46.8 million. Now, let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $515.4 million at the end of second quarter of 2020, compared to $492 million at the end of the first quarter of 2020. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $59.3 million, compared with Q1 2020 operating cash flow of $51.4 million. Second quarter 2020 capital spending totaled $14.6 million. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter of 2020 at $55.1 million, representing 27 days of sales outstanding, which was three days lower than the 30 days reported at the end of the first quarter of 2020 and six days lower than the 33 days in the second quarter of 2019. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter of 2020 were $152.1 million, up from the $131.5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2020. Days of inventory of 166 days at the end of the second quarter of 2020 were five days higher than at the end of the first quarter of 2020. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2020. As we are still in the midst of COVID pandemic, demand visibility for the remainder of the year is not as crisp as we usually see at this point in the year. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in the range of $200 million to $210 million. We also expect the following; GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.2% to 55.8%, non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.5% to 56.1%, total stock-based compensation expense of $21.2 million to $23.2 million including approximately $700,000 that would be charged to cost of goods sold. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses should be between $70.7 million and $74.7 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses should be in the range of $50.2 million to $52.2 million. Litigation expense should range between $1.8 million and $2.2 million, interest income is expected to range from $1.5 million to $1.7 million, and fully diluted shares to be in the range of 46.5 million to 47.5 million shares. In conclusion, we continue to grow year-over-year. We are excited about our design activities in the pipeline and expanding our reach in the new frontiers. I will now open the webinar for questions. Very broad based. No. I think we've always had a very good track record with credit and collections and the 27 days in the quarter really is a reflection of how front-loaded the initial sales were in Q2. Thank you, Tore. Sure. I think that just given the nature of the current macro environment where we did benefit from accelerated ordering patterns, particularly in -- at the end of Q1 that we don't want to become complacent, because we have seen falloffs in demand after we've had a big run-up like we just experienced. So it isn't that we're seeing anything specifically in the market that causes us concern, but just past experience tells us that it's something that we have to monitor. And one last thing just to follow-up on Michael's comment there is that in the beginning of the year, we did have concerns about supply chain capacity. And we've lowered that risk, but that's still an issue that is requiring ongoing management. And I think to keep in mind that in a lot of the markets that Michael just listed is that, we are relatively small players. So we have a lot of upside greenfield opportunities that should continue to drive our growth for the next two to three years at least. Yes. And I think we tried to add some color to that in the prepared comments by saying that, we enjoyed a noteworthy step up between Q1 and Q2 or Q4 and Q1 and we maintain that same high level in Q2. So when you look at the year-over-year server is one of our largest year-over-year growth drivers. I think that the term that we referred to at the end of Q1 was the toilet paper effect that there was an outsized ordering pattern in the last four weeks of March and so we had to take Q2 to more closely understand what that represented. And after we went customer-by-customer and geography to geography, we found out that there were a couple of drivers, well 3. The first was, that there was a increase stepped up increase in demand and particularly as it relates to work from home applications. And so that included storage and 5G and notebooks and then as I said earlier continued strong ordering within automotive. But there was also an acceleration of demand where the distributors and customers wanted to get in line to make sure that they were not. So what we've had to do is a very close evaluation to make sure that we don't let the channel inventories rise too much because of over-enthusiasm. But at this point, we enter this quarter again with a similar backlog profile, as we had last quarter meaning that there's low no reliance on turns business in order to meet our expectations. Yeah. I think that to give full credit, our operations capabilities were put to the test in the early part of this year. And I think that, we responded as well as one could have expected. And most of the numbers that you cited as far as the capacity expansion are pretty close to the mark. I'm not going to confirm or reject them you're in the ballpark. And I think that, it remains an issue because as we look ahead our growth prospects for the next three to five years certainly are significant. And so what we're trying to do is get both capacity but then also get a geographically distributed. So, that's going to require a continuing level of investment, as we look ahead here for the next few years. And I would also probably just having learned from this recent experience that, we're more likely to also increase our internal inventories, so we don't have to rely upon necessarily in the moment production excellence. Yes. I think that Q3 we're going to see a restabilization in the market. Interestingly, even though the manufacturing of the OEMs was shut down for two to three months, people still continue to buy cars. So there is some pent-up demand that they need to meet. But I think that the ramp may not be -- it won't necessarily snap back, I'm expecting to see some additional improvement in Q4, as they start to roll out the new model year. But I don't see it being the stair-step growth that we've experienced in past years. I think that the gaming console is a very -- a somewhat predictable business, as far as there's almost a bell-shaped curve that occurs over five months beginning in June and ending in October. So that is pretty heavily weighted towards Q3 for what we sell into. And right now the visibility will not be crisp, is the word we used before, probably until late August or early September. Though, right now, we seem to be tracking very well against our expectations. Yes. Stable is not a word I normally assigned to gaming consoles, because it does create this bubble which has certain of its own management challenges. But, yes, I would say, that the demand is meeting our expectations and we have adequate supply chain to handle it. No. I think the work from home phenomena is real and at some level, we are able to quantify it. But I do think that it is a more front-end loaded cycle as we sort of offered an earlier response. And the only thing to really add is that we're such a small player and this is sort of our first opportunity to really experience accelerated revenue growth, again our visibility and predictability is a little bit low for us right now. The primary competition is really with ADI and this is the advanced analog. And you're exactly correct that the first opportunity that we're pursuing is actually with a customer and they've provided us their spec and we would expect to be able to have a product that can be prototyped by the end of this year and have initial revenue after that. As far as the longer-term road map, we talked about communications because it is the next targeted market that were high-performance analog. Yes. So just finishing up where the need for high-frequency and high precision. And as I said there's only one or two other players out there. It's a very difficult market to penetrate. But here again, we believe, we're very well positioned to move into it over the course of the next three to five years. Both in the 12-volt as well as 48-volt. Great. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this webinar. And look forward to talking to you again during our third quarter webinar, which will likely be at the end of October. Thank you and have a great day."

            "content": "Yes. We try to expand another fab and we're exploring another 12-inch fabs, okay, as well as a 8-inch fab outside of China. Yeah. Tore, our product is a very fundamental use of building blocks, okay? And we supply all these power to power management for all electronic devices and including automotive. And now one segment clearly in this pandemic and everybody knows the infrastructures for telecommunications and data centers and as well as IoTs and the PCs and they'll grow. And MPS okay just supply these are building blocks for all these segments. And as Bernie said earlier other than automotive all segments are doing well. Yeah. Thank you. Tore. Yes. The Bernie's comment was very similar to our statement in the Q1 and Q2, okay? We didn't -- we expect at the time that all segment will grow including automotive. And so what is the magnitude of the growth is to our surprise. And even during the first couple of quarters, we -- first quarter, we mentioned again we have more order than we can ship. And so now we're going to second half of this year's the macro conditions to us is not very much -- it's not unsettled. And so we will prepare to change quickly. And -- but overall orders are still very good. It's -- a couple of them clearly is 48 volts and as we talk about it and the other one is in the data centers business. And also as Bernie mentioned earlier in automotive, we engaged with heavily and a lot of activity in ADAS. Yes. Server growth is not a surprise to us. And we talk about it in the past quarters. And we expected a growth from -- say from a year ago. And this year we will grow substantially from last year. So there is no surprises. And so our product is as I remind everybody, it's still a power supply and we're powering up the CPUs and powering up all the electronics electronic devices using a server. Yeah. Our assumption, the toilet paper effect wasn't quite right. There is very little, okay? And so the -- after we're diving and deeper into our customers, our distributors, and we found that these growths are real growth and somewhat is very sustainable. Yeah. Let's put that way, our production people and they're working at over 100%. And we still have more revenue that we can ship. I mean, we can order than more than we can ship. And as we increase the capacities in the last six months, the issues are much better now. We are the new players. Okay? We are a relatively small player in the market segment. And we don't see -- for our revenue growth we don't see any slowdown. And as we become a much bigger percentage then we can answer your question better. Rick, your question is barely audible and barely interpretable. We can try it okay try to answer your questions. And 5G is our biggest -- one of the biggest opportunities and very highly concentrated customers. And as you know, the 4G we were not in that and we don't have any revenues. Okay, very little revenues. And now we became a significant player in there and that's because our technologies. And as far as where to grow and which regions?

At this time all participants lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call to Bernie Blegen, Chief Financial Officer.\nBernie Blegen: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the first quarter 2020 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS is with me on today's call.In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2020 which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call.We will be discussing gross margins, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to financial measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 2019, Q4 2019 and Q1 2020 releases as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website.I would also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today.Before going through our financial results, I would like to acknowledge the difficult circumstances we are all operating under. At MPS, we have taken all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of our employees, our suppliers and our customers. At the same time, we remain focused on the need to execute at the highest level possible. Our worldwide efforts are reflected in our continuing level of innovation and customer support.In response to the news of extreme shortages of medical equipment, MPS rose to the occasion to fight the global pandemic. As described in our recent press release, MPS developed and assembled an emergency ventilator prototype in a matter of days leveraging a MIT open-source design concept. We demonstrated our technological superiority and deep system application knowledge to showcase our capability to advance from a component provider to a solution provider in a short period of time.We believe we can help our customers to do the same by taking advantage of MPS' vast and diversified product portfolio, which is highly programmable, flexible and feature-rich. We are also encouraged by the excitement we have received from our existing and potential customers that will lead to many promising opportunities in the medical device industry.Turning now to our financial results. MPS posted record first quarter revenue of $165.8 million, 17.3% higher than the comparable quarter in 2019. MPS continues to benefit from our technology leadership and diversified multi-market strategy.Looking at our revenue by market. In our computing and storage market, first quarter 2020 revenue of $52.0 million increased $12.8 million or 32.6% year-over-year. First quarter 2020 computing and storage revenue represented 31.3% of MPS' first quarter 2020 revenue compared with 27.7% in the first quarter of 2019. The year-over-year revenue increase primarily reflected sales growth for cloud-based servers and storage.First quarter 2020 communications revenue of $27.9 million rose $5.7 million or 25.6% from the first quarter of 2019. The year-over-year revenue increase primarily reflected higher 5G networking sales. Communications revenue represented 16.8% of MPS' first quarter 2020 revenue compared with 15.7% in the first quarter of 2019. First quarter 2020 industrial revenue of $25.2 million increased 18.3% from the first quarter of 2019 and accounted for 15.2% of our total first quarter revenue. The increase over the first quarter of 2019 primarily reflected games and smart meters and security applications.First quarter 2020 automotive revenue of $23.3 million grew 13.6% over the same period of 2019, representing 14.1% of MPS' first quarter 2020 revenue. This growth primarily represented increased sales of infotainment, safety and connectivity application products.First quarter of 2020 revenue from consumer markets of $37.4 million decreased $700,000 or 1.9% from the same period of 2019. The year-over-year revenue decrease reflected continuing reductions in demand for set-top boxes and flat-panel TVs. Consumer revenue represented 22.6% of our Q1 revenue compared with 27.0% contribution in the first quarter of 2019.GAAP gross margin was 55.2%, 10 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2019 and flat with the first quarter of 2019. Our GAAP operating income was $31.0 million compared with $30.7 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the first quarter of 2020, non-GAAP gross margin was 55.5%, matching the fourth quarter of 2019, but 10 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2019.Our non-GAAP operating income was $45.9 million compared to $50.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our GAAP operating expenses were $60.5 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared with $61.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2020 operating expenses were $46.1 million, up from the $41.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. This increase primarily reflected higher Q1 payroll taxes and increased investment in new products.The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the first quarter of 2020, total stock compensation expense including approximately $600,000 charge to cost of goods sold was $18.6 million compared with $18.7 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2019.Switching to the bottomline. First quarter 2020 GAAP net income was $35.8 million or $0.77 per fully diluted share compared with $32.4 million or $0.70 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our Q1 2020 tax provision of minus 22% was due to a one-time discrete tax benefit resulting from stock compensation. First quarter 2020 non-GAAP net income was $44.3 million or $0.95 per fully diluted share compared with $48.4 million or $1.04 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2019. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q1 2020 were 46.7 million.Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $492.3 million at the end of the first quarter of 2020, compared with $458.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $51.4 million compared with operating cash flow of $61.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. First quarter 2020 capital spending totaled $10 million. Accounts receivable ended the first quarter of 2020 $54.3 million or 30 days of sales outstanding, up one day from 29 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter of 2020 was $131.5 million, up from the $127.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. Days of inventory increased to 161 days at the end of Q1 2020, compared with 155 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019.I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2020. We are forecasting Q2 revenue in the range of $167 million to $173 million. We also expect the following. GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.02% to 55.6%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.3% to 55.9%. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $60.9 million and $64.9 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $43.4 million to $45.4 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Total stock-based compensation expense of $18.1 million to $20.1 million, including approximately $600,000 that will be charged to cost of goods sold. Litigation expenses are expected to range between $1.7 million to $2.1 million. Interest and other income is expected to range from $1.7 million to $1.9 million before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 45.8 million to 47.8 million shares.In conclusion, we are not immune to the macroeconomic reality. But our long term growth prospects remain intact. We will continue to execute to our plan and are prepared to manage volatility of future customer demand.I will now open the phone lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead, Tore.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you Michael and Bernie and congratulations on these results in a very challenging environment. First question and you maybe this is a bit philosophical but innovative companies tend to gain a lot of share during a downturn. We are obviously in a downturn. I was just wondering, Michael, if there are certain things that you are looking at to obviously come out of this even stronger than going into this?\nMichael Hsing: Tore, you remember the history. great. We tend to --\nTore Svanberg: Michael, you are breaking up. Michael, you are breaking up unfortunately.\nMichael Hsing: Can you hear me?\nTore Svanberg: Yes. You might go to the handset instead of the speaker.\nMichael Hsing: Sure.\nTore Svanberg: There you go. You are fine.\nMichael Hsing: Okay. Can you hear me now?\nTore Svanberg: Yes, we can. Yes, it's much better.\nMichael Hsing: All right, okay. Yes, as I stated earlier, Tore, if you remember MPS' history, because you do cover those things since day one of MPS become a public company. And somehow, we tend to do that. And in the downturn, we tend to do well and relatively in the normal times, we are just as good as just everybody else. But the percentage of growth tend to be slightly slower or slightly lower. And how we achieved, I think is that we don't really, our target is many years out. And regardless of the downturns or upturns, we are very consistent. So it's not like other company maybe because they have all the large market share and they tend to react to a shorter term. So if you can think about it and the philosophy and we will tend to well during a downturn.\nTore Svanberg: That's very helpful. And on a similar topic, but more specific, your e-commerce business. I do appreciate it's taken a while to get that up and running. But in this sort of virtual environment we live in, I would think that a business like that would be very, very welcome. So maybe you can elaborate a little bit on what's been going on, on that front?\nMichael Hsing: Well, as I said in last quarter, we said e-commerce, like we kind of drop a hook in the Pacific Ocean. There is a lot of fish there. But we didn't hook that. Too many things and all of that. So we are still in the early stage. However, in the last couple of months, we launched ventilators. That attracted so many of new customers or new potential customers and it overwhelmed us. And it's kind of a surprise to us. I think that we are a small company and we are relatively new company and people don't know us. Just we need time and we need to learn how to do it.\nTore Svanberg: That's great. One last question for Bernie. Bernie, you talked about the computing and storage business being up quite dramatically year-over-year. Some other players in the space obviously are talking about similar strength. Did you get a sense that there is some pull-in activity going on there? Intel, for instance, they talk about obviously the second half being weaker than the first half. Any color you can add on that would be great. Thank you.\nBernie Blegen: Sure. I think we are seeing a pattern that's probably consistent with other companies who have exposure to either 5G or data center or to notebooks as there is continuing investment in order to service the work from home aspect of the economy right now. So there has been a lot of activity, particularly in storage, particularly in data center and we are seen a continuing level of investment also in 5G. Again, as with any expectation of what the second half of look like, obviously, this is a challenging environment and we normally only forecast one quarter ahead.\nTore Svanberg: Very good. Congratulations again. Thank you.\nBernie Blegen: Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please go ahead, Matt.\nJosh Buchalter: Hi. This is Josh Buchalter, on behalf of Matt. Thanks for taking my question. I hope everyone is hanging in there okay. I know you guys love questions on inventory. But given all the moving parts on both the supply and demand side, could you update us about how you feel and your comfort level after last quarter you sort of lamented bringing levels down? It would be helpful to hear an update on your visibility into both your on books and in the channel. Thanks.\nMichael Hsing: Well, in the last couple of quarters, we said that our bookings are very good and it is still is. And we have inventory problems, the problem to related to and deliver to our customers up and above. And this issues and this growth of this year, we didn't say is from the last couple quarters. We said it a lot earlier. But our macro market have some uncertainty and we were so criticized we have a way inventory. So last December, we took a step and reduced our inventory. And now, barely we can do beyond our forecast. So the condition is even more murkier now. And we had to just react accordingly.\nBernie Blegen: And if I can add to Michael's good point there is that through the challenges that we are facing in the economy right now, as you can see that we continue to operate at nearly 100% capacity both in terms of our supply chain as well as our internal operations. Now, I do not want to minimize those challenges and anyway take away from a lot of very difficult and hard effort on the part of a lot of employees that made that all happen. But so far, we have had minimal disruptions to the supply chain.\nJosh Buchalter: Yes. Thank you. I appreciate all the color. And then as my follow-up, are you able to provide any color on your expectations by segment for the second quarter? Thanks and congratulations on the stellar results.\nBernie Blegen: Sure. I can take this one quickly on the numbers front is, is responded to the earlier question is that I believe that much of the growth that we expect to enjoy, should come from the computing and storage as well as in 5G. There is a weakening in demand in traditional consumer and also in automotive.\nMichael Hsing: Here is, as added, okay. We try to have a very diverse growth. And my job is, if I do the best job, is for you guys not to know which segment is the growth. And we want to so diversify and you don't know which side, which one and we occupy a very small percentage of each market. And look at the consumer and actually within the consumer, there is a lot of fundamental shift. We shift from traditional TV set-top box and which still have some percentage and within that we have a huge change. We chose to do a much higher high-end of our consumer products and as well the Internet of Things.\nJosh Buchalter: Thanks guys.\nBernie Blegen: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Go ahead, Quinn.\nQuinn Bolton: Hi guys. Let me offer my congratulations on the nice results and outlook. You guys are significantly outperforming a number of the analog peers sequentially and certainly year-over-year. And I think that that we have seen a number of the analog peers talk about in there forecast, I think they refer to seeing some customers buying ahead or building inventory. And just wondering if you might be able to address that specifically on the compute and 5G side? I know you mentioned that auto and consumer is softening. So maybe just kind of go through just whether you think there is there is any buy ahead activity that may be influencing second quarter guidance? And then I have got a follow-up.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. And of course, we are concerned. It's like a toilet paper effect, right. Just a few months ago, all the shelf and the toilet papers are gone. I mean and whether we have see the same kind of effect on us, we really don't know. In some of the areas like in PCs and data centers have a surge. But we kind of expected that. And other ones in the consumer area and it's actually slower than our expectations. But we have to be quick on the feet and we have to react quickly. And in the meantime, we ship as much as we can.\nQuinn Bolton: Got it. And then just looking in that data center business, I think Intel has recently canceled the Cooper Lake processor generation to focus on the 10 nanometer Ice Lake to launch late this year. Just wondering if that's had any impact on the Whitley ramp as if you see it? Or are you seeing pretty good design activity, either for existing Purley systems or the initial ramp of Whitley just over the balance of the year? Thank you.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. Good question. So are experience has been showing that we are receiving the same level of customer engagement. And that going back to Michael's point about Q2, that the level of order momentum has continued unabated, regardless of the product change, the change in the product cycle. So at this point, we may not have the full benefit of how end demand will be shaped by this change. But I don't see any early indicators that give me pause. And one other thing to make this specific is going back to Michael's point on being diversified. The business model is not dependent on any individual product launch or the timing. So as I said, that's the advantage of our diversified portfolio.\nQuinn Bolton: Great. Congratulations again guys.\nBernie Blegen: Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Please go ahead, Chris.\nChris Caso: Yes. Thank you. First question is just regarding product cycles for the year. And I would imagine much like last year, there is a certain part of the business, a large part of the business, which is just driven by product cycles getting customer designs out the door and another portion of it which is related to run rate business. So perhaps that might be affected by downtick in demand. Could you characterize the business? What parts would be more driven by product cycles? What parts would be driven more by run rate demand? And take a look and give us some sense of f how that plays out through the second half?\nMichael Hsing: The second half, okay, look, it's not just a philosophical rate, it's not very clear, okay. But our customers' demand is as high as ever. But we divided and we engage our customers in a variety of assignments. And so when they ramp up and it's kind of very short notice, a few and when they test the market and their market is reacting well then they have a huge ramp. And so that's why we need enough inventory to support these new product win. And to answer your question of which particular market segment, in the last couple months, there is the total ship target, the engagement with the customer's total ship in the medical field now. And a lot of parts and a lot of inquiries and all this is particularly helped by the ventilator is totally to our surprise. And at the same time, we didn't expect the computing ramp as this much, okay. And it's just and particularly in the memory side, in the memory power, what is the Bernie, SMD?\nBernie Blegen: Yes, SMD.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. So that's our scenario now. And going forward, we are not very clear. And I know that if the new trend is you can work from home and you can work remotely and the cloud computing, the data center, the communication will keep going on. And we are accelerating.\nChris Caso: Thank you. I am sorry.\nBernie Blegen: I am sorry. I just had two small thing to add to that is that on the notebooks, seasonally, those are driven where you have a high Q3 and Q4 and then it tails off. But we see nothing in the aside from cyclical changes there. And then obviously, we have a gaming console that will start to ramp here in the end of the Q2.\nChris Caso: That's helpful. Thank you. As a follow-up, you talked about qualifying some new capacity on 300 millimeter into the second half. Could you give us an update on that? And you know, in the current environment has there been any change to your plans or your need for that capacity either greater or less?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. If we see some push outs, it is above and beyond. And if they don't have those push out we are even in deep trouble. And in terms of a customer relationship, not in terms of delivery the numbers. And we are working very hard. We try very hard to bring up another fab and as you know that this is not like an overnight, okay, at least take the half years. And I think that we can meet our demand and qualify some of the high runners.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. We should be able to qualify the high runners before the end of this year and actually be shipping from that fab.\nChris Caso: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. Please go ahead, William.\nWilliam Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Michael and Bernie, congrats on the good result and outlook. Michael, you mentioned at the start of the call, a transition from a component to a solutions company and you highlighted the ventilator as an example. But at the Analyst Day, you also showed several things that looked like a precursor to this in a way, not only e.Motion, but these programmable modules. And I wonder if there is anything more sort of quantitative that you could disclose to us in terms of revenue or growth or designs or orders as it relates to that what we might describe as a transition or a new leg of growth to the business?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. We haven't really prepared a qualitative numbers to use. And as a business, that type of a business, we have to think about how we how we disclose it very accurately to our investors. And it is clearly that trend and we want to make our solutions like our product, a chip-based solution is really ease-of-use. That is the trick. And to lot of like power supplies, lot of motor controls, okay, motion controls and even for the power supply for the data center, lot of technology are maturing, okay. What is on top of that? It's really a plug-in place solution. And you want to take away all the design effort from our customers. And in terms of, maybe Bernie, our modules are doing really well, right? Our modules and if you are talking about only power modules, so we from two, three years ago, like in single low digit million dollars of sales, we now at least of $35 million, $40 million in last year. And that number is great. This is the fastest the growth in percentage wise in MPS revenue streak.\nBernie Blegen: I think I would probably add to that, if I can, that Mike was exactly right, that we haven't really articulated a financial model where we can quantify it in a way that would be meaningful to you. I agree with Michael's assessment of how we are doing with power modules. The thing that I would add though is, whether you are looking at programmability, you are looking at e-commerce solution, you are looking at e.Motion or the power modules integrated solutions that we were just talking about it, it's all about an overarching strategy as far as how to differentiate and leverage all of our multiple technologies and differentiate ourselves in the market.\nWilliam Stein: Well, that's helpful. If I can have a follow-up, please. I think last quarter, you talked a little bit about a new area that the business was on investing in and that was high performance converters. I am wondering if you can provide an update on design wins, revenue, any sort of traction that we could think about there. Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Okay. That group will be joining and they brought in opportunity. We have six, seven guys joining the company and they brought in opportunities. We have the customers, okay, now. And they engage with the customers for the medical companies for a while. And so actually we don't any significant inputs, not a change. And I think that we work with these kind of things that takes about, this is very unusual, okay. So it takes less than a year, we can some results. Usually our product, even internal developments and the ground-up development, we are taking about two or three years to see anything. And this one is, okay, so far is looking good.\nWilliam Stein: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you so much. Our next question is from Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, Rick.\nRick Schafer: Thank you and congratulation to you guys. In a tough time, you continue to execute. I guess my first question, talking about tough times. I know everybody's seen IHS forecast auto SAAR, I think, down over 20% this year. You guys obviously have a content and it's a pretty significant share gains in that vertical. Do you look at that this year and say that that's enough to offset down, let's say, 20% SAAR? I mean, could your auto revenues be flat for the year? Could they grow in this kind of environment?\nMichael Hsing: I think that we look at our history, okay. And we can tag on what is your macro economy segment growth in a downwards in our segment. And we are confident enough, we can say that we can beat it by 10%.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. We got an education in 2019 when there was a complete falloff in production in China and a soft demand in North America and Europe in particular. So I think if you use that as a guide, you can say that the SAAR was down but we were able to grow at about 13%, 14% last year. So to Michael's point is, you cannot apply whatever you think the market is going to do and we are going to outperform by a minimum of 10 percentage points. And last year, it's closer 20%.\nRick Schafer: Great. And then just pivoting into 5G and just maybe if you could provide an update on your 5G ramp opportunity? Maybe give us sense of the MPS dollar opportunity in a macro base station? And part of my question, I am just curious, it seems like such a massive opportunity for you guys. Could 5G be as big as server for you if we fast forwarded two or three years?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Okay. That's a good question. And I only can tell you this. We know 4G, we were out the door. We didn't have any chance. And this the first time we engage with a variety of customers and the ODMs and OEMs and event their suppliers. And so we engage both side, okay. And the real telecom companies and also their supply. And all we see of the opportunity is that we have never seen it before. How big the market is, okay? And we cannot quantify and I am not trying to tell we are in the dark here. We are new. We are a newcomer. And all I know, the opportunity is huge and we don't even try to quantify what's the opportunity. And we all notice as long it is very big.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. And I think you were asking for guidance on the dollar content for the base station. And Michael was correct that we don't have a number. We are too new.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. I can tell you why we don't, okay. In a particularly and which segments of the 5G. Our product is in the building box of a 5G. So if you think about it as a brick for the building. And our product there is the standard product in those company and that's going to be use everywhere.\nRick Schafer: Got it. Thanks a lot guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kamil Mielczarek with William Blair. Go ahead, Kamil.\nKamil Mielczarek: Hi. Congratulations on strong results in this uncertain environment. Can you tell me how design win activity has been trending during the pandemic versus your expectations? And how do you balance growth and margin in this environment? What levers you have to maintain or potentially expand gross margin? Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. The gross margin obviously wiggles a little bit on the sideways in the second half of last year and we are not happy about it. But we try to be very consistent. And given the macro conditions, it kind of makes sense to us. But the new product, particularly the new product is slower. It's ramped at a pretty good rate. But in some of the higher value product it was slower. So that's why the margins go. But in the long term and the margin will steadily go up.\nKamil Mielczarek: And first part of the question was design activity?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Okay. Sorry, forgot about it. That was a very good question. And obviously normal activity slow down which doesn't impact us, okay. We are very much used to it in a work form from outside office. And we still very much engage with our customer but in a very different way, okay, very different market segments. Lot of them relates to medical equipment. And we shift our head where MPS in the past was always a pretty fast on the feet. And so we shift all our interests and we support those customers. But it's not like a normal business now.\nBernie Blegen: One thing I can add to that is that interestingly our operations and our customers' operations in China and in Asia came back online about a month ago. And so not going to try to say that our business as usual. But in the area of the world where we have up to 90% of our employees including a large share of our design professional as well as a majority of our end customer engagement, we were actually seeing a good cadence, good momentum. And as Michael said, on the U.S. front where we are still in the shelter in place, both in our Washington and in our San Jose offices, we have developed over the last several years the ability to both do field application engineering and customer engagement via Zoom and we are fairly competent of that.\nMichael Hsing: Bernie, it's not like 90%. It more like a 60% some percent, okay. Yes, we do have a testing and a reliability center that's in China, but in terms of the number of people, Asia, across the Asia, including Japan and most of the U.S. and Europe is okay, including Japan, probably as some percent, okay.\nBernie Blegen: Yes.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. So we are more diverse across the world.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our next question is from Hans Mosesmann with Rosenblatt Securities.\nKevin Garrigan: Hi guys. This is Kevin Garrigan, on for Hans. Thank you for taking my question. And congrats on the results. Just one quick one for me and my apologies if you had alluded to this already. You had mentioned that you are seeing minimal supply disruptions and that's driving good momentum with your Chinese customers. Can you give us any color in terms of if you are seeing any demand disruption?\nMichael Hsing: I don't know it was the Chinese customers. Did we say that, may be, okay. That's a misunderstanding, okay. And Bernie, you want to say that, okay?\nBernie Blegen: Yes. As far as any demand disruption occurring, we haven't seen any cancellation of projects or push-outs in orders in a material basis. Obviously, the duration of the macro environment is not understood right now. So we are very sensitive to seeing any early warning signs that we need to react to in this volatile environment. But as at this point in time, we have not seen a step down in demand on a broad base. There are some pockets that we mentioned in an earlier answer.\nKevin Garrigan: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nBernie Blegen: Thank you Kevin.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Williams with Loop Capital. Please go ahead, David.\nDavid Williams: Hi. Good afternoon and congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking the question as well. I just wanted to see if you had any color on maybe the console launches that are expected, you said, in the second half. How do you think that will ramp? Do you have a sense of what the demand is going to look like or what those volumes could potentially be?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. We have a pretty good knowledge but I cannot say that, okay. But that business is very cyclical, okay. And that's a very, for MPS is good money. And for stock value, okay, it's very contrary to what we do. It is very cyclical and that it ramp up and it buys once a year and for most of the year, they don't do anything, okay. And we have, after that, we had to fill up the gas. We have done pretty good in the last two or three years. But as the revenue keep growing, that will be a small part of our MPS business.\nDavid Williams: Great. Thank you. And then just kind of thinking about the comm segment and the design wins and maybe design activity there. Are you seeing a broader base of designs outside of maybe Huawei or some of the other larger companies? Just kind of can you talk about where your seeing the most potential or the most opportunity there?\nBernie Blegen: Sure. And if you look worldwide as far as where a lot of the deployment is, it is in those China and South Korea right now. Europe and North America has been a little slower. So most of our design engagement for now has been in the lab as opposed to actually being commercially rolled out.\nDavid Williams: Okay. Great. Sorry, go ahead.\nMichael Hsing: No. I just wanted to clarify, we don't employ any customers in our core. And we disclosed that we have large customers, okay. And by rules, okay. So in the 5G, as I said earlier, we engage not only one, okay and many different kind of different like telephone companies. We are also engaged with many different of their space.\nDavid Williams: Okay. Very good. And then lastly for me is, if you are thinking about the rest of the year and even the second quarter perhaps, what are your largest unknowns or potential hurdles that you kind of think about, areas of weakness could be seen? Or what are the areas, I guess, that you are most either troubled or concerned with or I guess paying most attention to, through the back of the year here?\nMichael Hsing: [indiscernible].\nBernie Blegen: Michael, you are breaking up again. I am sorry. You are breaking up.\nMichael Hsing: I will give you a philosophical joke, okay. Have a joke. We really worry about toilet paper effect. And it's actually, we don't know, then again the demands are very good for the second half of the year. And using, so as we do, okay. And when everything is good, they cancel and over order. And we won't see it, okay. Of course we try very hard, okay, to find what is the real reason, okay. And so far, we have a very good, that's what we try to do, okay. And until our customers start screaming at it. And then we are shipping a product.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. So as opposed to a concern of a rapid fall off, right now we are managing is the toilet paper effect where there is so much in badgering the demand we want to make sure that we are not building inventory on in the channel or in the distributor's warehouses. And the way we do that is we don't ship to the level that they requested. And then if they really do have a stock outage where they are going to lines down, we will hear about it quickly and respond to that. So that's the issue that we are managing now as far as looking beyond that. Maybe we will have better guidance or outlook next quarter.\nDavid Williams: Okay. Well, thanks so much. I appreciate. And the best of luck.\nBernie Blegen: Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session for today. I will turn the call back to Bernie Blegen for his final remarks.\nBernie Blegen: Right. Thank you very much. I would like to thank you all for joining us in this conference call. I look forward to talking to you again during our second quarter conference call, which will likely be at the end of July.

            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the first quarter 2020 Monolithic Power Systems conference call. Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS is with me on today's call.In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2020 which is accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call.We will be discussing gross margins, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to financial measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q1 2019, Q4 2019 and Q1 2020 releases as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website.I would also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today.Before going through our financial results, I would like to acknowledge the difficult circumstances we are all operating under. At MPS, we have taken all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of our employees, our suppliers and our customers. At the same time, we remain focused on the need to execute at the highest level possible. Our worldwide efforts are reflected in our continuing level of innovation and customer support.In response to the news of extreme shortages of medical equipment, MPS rose to the occasion to fight the global pandemic. As described in our recent press release, MPS developed and assembled an emergency ventilator prototype in a matter of days leveraging a MIT open-source design concept. We demonstrated our technological superiority and deep system application knowledge to showcase our capability to advance from a component provider to a solution provider in a short period of time.We believe we can help our customers to do the same by taking advantage of MPS' vast and diversified product portfolio, which is highly programmable, flexible and feature-rich. We are also encouraged by the excitement we have received from our existing and potential customers that will lead to many promising opportunities in the medical device industry.Turning now to our financial results. MPS posted record first quarter revenue of $165.8 million, 17.3% higher than the comparable quarter in 2019. MPS continues to benefit from our technology leadership and diversified multi-market strategy.Looking at our revenue by market. In our computing and storage market, first quarter 2020 revenue of $52.0 million increased $12.8 million or 32.6% year-over-year. First quarter 2020 computing and storage revenue represented 31.3% of MPS' first quarter 2020 revenue compared with 27.7% in the first quarter of 2019. The year-over-year revenue increase primarily reflected sales growth for cloud-based servers and storage.First quarter 2020 communications revenue of $27.9 million rose $5.7 million or 25.6% from the first quarter of 2019. The year-over-year revenue increase primarily reflected higher 5G networking sales. Communications revenue represented 16.8% of MPS' first quarter 2020 revenue compared with 15.7% in the first quarter of 2019. First quarter 2020 industrial revenue of $25.2 million increased 18.3% from the first quarter of 2019 and accounted for 15.2% of our total first quarter revenue. The increase over the first quarter of 2019 primarily reflected games and smart meters and security applications.First quarter 2020 automotive revenue of $23.3 million grew 13.6% over the same period of 2019, representing 14.1% of MPS' first quarter 2020 revenue. This growth primarily represented increased sales of infotainment, safety and connectivity application products.First quarter of 2020 revenue from consumer markets of $37.4 million decreased $700,000 or 1.9% from the same period of 2019. The year-over-year revenue decrease reflected continuing reductions in demand for set-top boxes and flat-panel TVs. Consumer revenue represented 22.6% of our Q1 revenue compared with 27.0% contribution in the first quarter of 2019.GAAP gross margin was 55.2%, 10 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2019 and flat with the first quarter of 2019. Our GAAP operating income was $31.0 million compared with $30.7 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the first quarter of 2020, non-GAAP gross margin was 55.5%, matching the fourth quarter of 2019, but 10 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2019.Our non-GAAP operating income was $45.9 million compared to $50.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our GAAP operating expenses were $60.5 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared with $61.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2020 operating expenses were $46.1 million, up from the $41.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. This increase primarily reflected higher Q1 payroll taxes and increased investment in new products.The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the first quarter of 2020, total stock compensation expense including approximately $600,000 charge to cost of goods sold was $18.6 million compared with $18.7 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2019.Switching to the bottomline. First quarter 2020 GAAP net income was $35.8 million or $0.77 per fully diluted share compared with $32.4 million or $0.70 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our Q1 2020 tax provision of minus 22% was due to a one-time discrete tax benefit resulting from stock compensation. First quarter 2020 non-GAAP net income was $44.3 million or $0.95 per fully diluted share compared with $48.4 million or $1.04 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2019. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q1 2020 were 46.7 million.Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $492.3 million at the end of the first quarter of 2020, compared with $458.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $51.4 million compared with operating cash flow of $61.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. First quarter 2020 capital spending totaled $10 million. Accounts receivable ended the first quarter of 2020 $54.3 million or 30 days of sales outstanding, up one day from 29 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter of 2020 was $131.5 million, up from the $127.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. Days of inventory increased to 161 days at the end of Q1 2020, compared with 155 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019.I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2020. We are forecasting Q2 revenue in the range of $167 million to $173 million. We also expect the following. GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.02% to 55.6%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.3% to 55.9%. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $60.9 million and $64.9 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $43.4 million to $45.4 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Total stock-based compensation expense of $18.1 million to $20.1 million, including approximately $600,000 that will be charged to cost of goods sold. Litigation expenses are expected to range between $1.7 million to $2.1 million. Interest and other income is expected to range from $1.7 million to $1.9 million before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 45.8 million to 47.8 million shares.In conclusion, we are not immune to the macroeconomic reality. But our long term growth prospects remain intact. We will continue to execute to our plan and are prepared to manage volatility of future customer demand.I will now open the phone lines for questions. Sure. I think we are seeing a pattern that's probably consistent with other companies who have exposure to either 5G or data center or to notebooks as there is continuing investment in order to service the work from home aspect of the economy right now. So there has been a lot of activity, particularly in storage, particularly in data center and we are seen a continuing level of investment also in 5G. Again, as with any expectation of what the second half of look like, obviously, this is a challenging environment and we normally only forecast one quarter ahead. Thank you. And if I can add to Michael's good point there is that through the challenges that we are facing in the economy right now, as you can see that we continue to operate at nearly 100% capacity both in terms of our supply chain as well as our internal operations. Now, I do not want to minimize those challenges and anyway take away from a lot of very difficult and hard effort on the part of a lot of employees that made that all happen. But so far, we have had minimal disruptions to the supply chain. Sure. I can take this one quickly on the numbers front is, is responded to the earlier question is that I believe that much of the growth that we expect to enjoy, should come from the computing and storage as well as in 5G. There is a weakening in demand in traditional consumer and also in automotive. Okay. Yes. Good question. So are experience has been showing that we are receiving the same level of customer engagement. And that going back to Michael's point about Q2, that the level of order momentum has continued unabated, regardless of the product change, the change in the product cycle. So at this point, we may not have the full benefit of how end demand will be shaped by this change. But I don't see any early indicators that give me pause. And one other thing to make this specific is going back to Michael's point on being diversified. The business model is not dependent on any individual product launch or the timing. So as I said, that's the advantage of our diversified portfolio. Thank you. Yes, SMD. I am sorry. I just had two small thing to add to that is that on the notebooks, seasonally, those are driven where you have a high Q3 and Q4 and then it tails off. But we see nothing in the aside from cyclical changes there. And then obviously, we have a gaming console that will start to ramp here in the end of the Q2. Yes. We should be able to qualify the high runners before the end of this year and actually be shipping from that fab. I think I would probably add to that, if I can, that Mike was exactly right, that we haven't really articulated a financial model where we can quantify it in a way that would be meaningful to you. I agree with Michael's assessment of how we are doing with power modules. The thing that I would add though is, whether you are looking at programmability, you are looking at e-commerce solution, you are looking at e.Motion or the power modules integrated solutions that we were just talking about it, it's all about an overarching strategy as far as how to differentiate and leverage all of our multiple technologies and differentiate ourselves in the market. Yes. We got an education in 2019 when there was a complete falloff in production in China and a soft demand in North America and Europe in particular. So I think if you use that as a guide, you can say that the SAAR was down but we were able to grow at about 13%, 14% last year. So to Michael's point is, you cannot apply whatever you think the market is going to do and we are going to outperform by a minimum of 10 percentage points. And last year, it's closer 20%. Yes. And I think you were asking for guidance on the dollar content for the base station. And Michael was correct that we don't have a number. We are too new. One thing I can add to that is that interestingly our operations and our customers' operations in China and in Asia came back online about a month ago. And so not going to try to say that our business as usual. But in the area of the world where we have up to 90% of our employees including a large share of our design professional as well as a majority of our end customer engagement, we were actually seeing a good cadence, good momentum. And as Michael said, on the U.S. front where we are still in the shelter in place, both in our Washington and in our San Jose offices, we have developed over the last several years the ability to both do field application engineering and customer engagement via Zoom and we are fairly competent of that. Yes. Yes. As far as any demand disruption occurring, we haven't seen any cancellation of projects or push-outs in orders in a material basis. Obviously, the duration of the macro environment is not understood right now. So we are very sensitive to seeing any early warning signs that we need to react to in this volatile environment. But as at this point in time, we have not seen a step down in demand on a broad base. There are some pockets that we mentioned in an earlier answer. Thank you Kevin. Sure. And if you look worldwide as far as where a lot of the deployment is, it is in those China and South Korea right now. Europe and North America has been a little slower. So most of our design engagement for now has been in the lab as opposed to actually being commercially rolled out. Michael, you are breaking up again. I am sorry. You are breaking up. Yes. So as opposed to a concern of a rapid fall off, right now we are managing is the toilet paper effect where there is so much in badgering the demand we want to make sure that we are not building inventory on in the channel or in the distributor's warehouses. And the way we do that is we don't ship to the level that they requested. And then if they really do have a stock outage where they are going to lines down, we will hear about it quickly and respond to that. So that's the issue that we are managing now as far as looking beyond that. Maybe we will have better guidance or outlook next quarter. Thank you. Right. Thank you very much. I would like to thank you all for joining us in this conference call. I look forward to talking to you again during our second quarter conference call, which will likely be at the end of July. Thank you and have a nice day."

            "name": "Michael Hsing",
            "content": "Tore, you remember the history. great. We tend to -- Can you hear me? Sure. Okay. Can you hear me now? All right, okay. Yes, as I stated earlier, Tore, if you remember MPS' history, because you do cover those things since day one of MPS become a public company. And somehow, we tend to do that. And in the downturn, we tend to do well and relatively in the normal times, we are just as good as just everybody else. But the percentage of growth tend to be slightly slower or slightly lower. And how we achieved, I think is that we don't really, our target is many years out. And regardless of the downturns or upturns, we are very consistent. So it's not like other company maybe because they have all the large market share and they tend to react to a shorter term. So if you can think about it and the philosophy and we will tend to well during a downturn. Well, as I said in last quarter, we said e-commerce, like we kind of drop a hook in the Pacific Ocean. There is a lot of fish there. But we didn't hook that. Too many things and all of that. So we are still in the early stage. However, in the last couple of months, we launched ventilators. That attracted so many of new customers or new potential customers and it overwhelmed us. And it's kind of a surprise to us. I think that we are a small company and we are relatively new company and people don't know us. Just we need time and we need to learn how to do it. Thank you. Well, in the last couple of quarters, we said that our bookings are very good and it is still is. And we have inventory problems, the problem to related to and deliver to our customers up and above. And this issues and this growth of this year, we didn't say is from the last couple quarters. We said it a lot earlier. But our macro market have some uncertainty and we were so criticized we have a way inventory. So last December, we took a step and reduced our inventory. And now, barely we can do beyond our forecast. So the condition is even more murkier now. And we had to just react accordingly. Here is, as added, okay. We try to have a very diverse growth. And my job is, if I do the best job, is for you guys not to know which segment is the growth. And we want to so diversify and you don't know which side, which one and we occupy a very small percentage of each market. And look at the consumer and actually within the consumer, there is a lot of fundamental shift. We shift from traditional TV set-top box and which still have some percentage and within that we have a huge change. We chose to do a much higher high-end of our consumer products and as well the Internet of Things. Yes. And of course, we are concerned. It's like a toilet paper effect, right. Just a few months ago, all the shelf and the toilet papers are gone. I mean and whether we have see the same kind of effect on us, we really don't know. In some of the areas like in PCs and data centers have a surge. But we kind of expected that. And other ones in the consumer area and it's actually slower than our expectations. But we have to be quick on the feet and we have to react quickly. And in the meantime, we ship as much as we can. Thank you. The second half, okay, look, it's not just a philosophical rate, it's not very clear, okay. But our customers' demand is as high as ever. But we divided and we engage our customers in a variety of assignments. And so when they ramp up and it's kind of very short notice, a few and when they test the market and their market is reacting well then they have a huge ramp. And so that's why we need enough inventory to support these new product win. And to answer your question of which particular market segment, in the last couple months, there is the total ship target, the engagement with the customer's total ship in the medical field now. And a lot of parts and a lot of inquiries and all this is particularly helped by the ventilator is totally to our surprise. And at the same time, we didn't expect the computing ramp as this much, okay. And it's just and particularly in the memory side, in the memory power, what is the Bernie, SMD? Yes. So that's our scenario now. And going forward, we are not very clear. And I know that if the new trend is you can work from home and you can work remotely and the cloud computing, the data center, the communication will keep going on. And we are accelerating. Yes. If we see some push outs, it is above and beyond. And if they don't have those push out we are even in deep trouble. And in terms of a customer relationship, not in terms of delivery the numbers. And we are working very hard. We try very hard to bring up another fab and as you know that this is not like an overnight, okay, at least take the half years. And I think that we can meet our demand and qualify some of the high runners. Yes. We haven't really prepared a qualitative numbers to use. And as a business, that type of a business, we have to think about how we how we disclose it very accurately to our investors. And it is clearly that trend and we want to make our solutions like our product, a chip-based solution is really ease-of-use. That is the trick. And to lot of like power supplies, lot of motor controls, okay, motion controls and even for the power supply for the data center, lot of technology are maturing, okay. What is on top of that? It's really a plug-in place solution. And you want to take away all the design effort from our customers. And in terms of, maybe Bernie, our modules are doing really well, right? Our modules and if you are talking about only power modules, so we from two, three years ago, like in single low digit million dollars of sales, we now at least of $35 million, $40 million in last year. And that number is great. This is the fastest the growth in percentage wise in MPS revenue streak. Yes. Okay. That group will be joining and they brought in opportunity. We have six, seven guys joining the company and they brought in opportunities. We have the customers, okay, now. And they engage with the customers for the medical companies for a while. And so actually we don't any significant inputs, not a change. And I think that we work with these kind of things that takes about, this is very unusual, okay. So it takes less than a year, we can some results. Usually our product, even internal developments and the ground-up development, we are taking about two or three years to see anything. And this one is, okay, so far is looking good. I think that we look at our history, okay. And we can tag on what is your macro economy segment growth in a downwards in our segment. And we are confident enough, we can say that we can beat it by 10%. Yes. Okay. That's a good question. And I only can tell you this. We know 4G, we were out the door. We didn't have any chance. And this the first time we engage with a variety of customers and the ODMs and OEMs and event their suppliers. And so we engage both side, okay. And the real telecom companies and also their supply. And all we see of the opportunity is that we have never seen it before. How big the market is, okay? And we cannot quantify and I am not trying to tell we are in the dark here. We are new. We are a newcomer. And all I know, the opportunity is huge and we don't even try to quantify what's the opportunity. And we all notice as long it is very big. Yes. I can tell you why we don't, okay. In a particularly and which segments of the 5G. Our product is in the building box of a 5G. So if you think about it as a brick for the building. And our product there is the standard product in those company and that's going to be use everywhere. Yes. The gross margin obviously wiggles a little bit on the sideways in the second half of last year and we are not happy about it. But we try to be very consistent. And given the macro conditions, it kind of makes sense to us. But the new product, particularly the new product is slower. It's ramped at a pretty good rate. But in some of the higher value product it was slower. So that's why the margins go. But in the long term and the margin will steadily go up. Yes. Okay. Sorry, forgot about it. That was a very good question. And obviously normal activity slow down which doesn't impact us, okay. We are very much used to it in a work form from outside office. And we still very much engage with our customer but in a very different way, okay, very different market segments. Lot of them relates to medical equipment. And we shift our head where MPS in the past was always a pretty fast on the feet. And so we shift all our interests and we support those customers. But it's not like a normal business now. Bernie, it's not like 90%. It more like a 60% some percent, okay. Yes, we do have a testing and a reliability center that's in China, but in terms of the number of people, Asia, across the Asia, including Japan and most of the U.S. and Europe is okay, including Japan, probably as some percent, okay. Yes. So we are more diverse across the world. I don't know it was the Chinese customers. Did we say that, may be, okay. That's a misunderstanding, okay. And Bernie, you want to say that, okay? Yes. We have a pretty good knowledge but I cannot say that, okay. But that business is very cyclical, okay. And that's a very, for MPS is good money. And for stock value, okay, it's very contrary to what we do. It is very cyclical and that it ramp up and it buys once a year and for most of the year, they don't do anything, okay. And we have, after that, we had to fill up the gas. We have done pretty good in the last two or three years. But as the revenue keep growing, that will be a small part of our MPS business. No. I just wanted to clarify, we don't employ any customers in our core. And we disclosed that we have large customers, okay. And by rules, okay. So in the 5G, as I said earlier, we engage not only one, okay and many different kind of different like telephone companies. We are also engaged with many different of their space. [indiscernible]. I will give you a philosophical joke, okay. Have a joke. We really worry about toilet paper effect. And it's actually, we don't know, then again the demands are very good for the second half of the year. And using, so as we do, okay. And when everything is good, they cancel and over order. And we won't see it, okay. Of course we try very hard, okay, to find what is the real reason, okay. And so far, we have a very good, that's what we try to do, okay. And until our customers start screaming at it. And then we are shipping a product. Thank you."

Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for one year on our Investor Relations page at www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, as CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. In the course of today\u2019s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management\u2019s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q4 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2021, and Form 10-Q filed on November 8, 2021, both which are accessible through our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today\u2019s call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our Q4 and full year 2021 earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC and is currently available on our website. I\u2019d also like to remind you that today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.\nBernie Blegen: Thanks, Jen. In 2021, MPS surpassed the $1 billion revenue milestone by achieving record full year revenue $1.2 billion, 43.0% higher than the prior year. This performance represented consistent execution against our strategies and being recognized by more first tiered companies for our superior technologies, product quality and excellent customer support. As we see more highly \u2013 high quality growth opportunities ahead of us, we continue to invest in our infrastructure and operational capabilities. In 2021, MPS grew capacity by 40% and we are on track to expand capacity in 2022, well beyond $2 billion allowing the company to successfully ramp new product revenue and achieve strategic market share gains. Here are a few highlights, which we achieved in 2021. Brought online a new 8 inch fab and continued to qualify parts in the 12 inch fab, we brought online in 2020. We will continue to invest in growing fab and assembly capacity. We design processor cores and MCU technology into products requiring more sophisticated power solutions such as USB power delivery, smart motor drives, and high power electrification. Our first prototype of a high precision analog digital converter product for medical applications achieved outstanding silicon performance and lab evaluations. We have started customer sampling in Q1 2022. Validation of this technology is a strong first step in developing a new business segment supporting both industrial and infrastructure end market applications. We believe new product revenue from a large number of previously released designs will ramp in 2022. The representative sample includes product supporting applications in VR14, 5G, BMS, ADAS, AI, USB PD, DDR, and many more. Turning to our full year 2021 revenue by market segment compared to 2020, automotive revenue was up 87.5% computing and storage revenue up 47.0%, industrial revenue up 54.5%, consumer revenue up 28.1% and communications revenue up 15.3% demonstrating just how broad based our full year 2021 revenue improvement was. Automotive revenue grew $95.4 million to $204.3 million in 2021. This 87.5% year-over-year gain primarily represented increased sales of our highly integrated applications supporting the digital cockpit, automotive \u2013 automated driver assistance systems and connectivity. Automotive revenue represented 16.9% of MPS\u2019 full year 2021 revenue compared with 12.9% in 2020. Full year 2021 computing and storage revenue grew $119.1 million over the prior year to $372.3 million. This 47.0% increase primarily resulted from strong sales growth for enterprise notebooks, cloud computing and storage applications. Computing and storage revenue represented 30.8% of MPS\u2019 of revenue in 2021, compared with 30.0% in 2020. Industrial revenue grew $65.2 million to $184.8 million in 2021. This 54.5% year-over-year increase was broad based with each our primary product lines enjoying better than double-digit revenue growth. Industrial revenue represented 15.3% of MPS\u2019 full year 2021 revenue, compared with 14.2% in 2020. Consumer revenue grew $61.9 million to $282.3 million reflecting increased product sales for home appliances and smart TVs. Consumer revenue represented 23.4% of MPS\u2019 full year 2021 revenue, compared with 26.1% in 2020. Communications revenue grew $21.8 million to $164.1 million. This 15.3% improvement reflected higher sales of products for both infrastructure and wireless riders and gateway applications. Communications revenue represented 13.6% of our 2021 revenue, compared with 16.9% in 2020. Switching to Q4. MPS had a record fourth quarter with revenue of $336.5 million, 4.0% higher than revenue generated in the third quarter of 2021 and 44.4% higher than the comparable quarter in 2020. By market segment, revenue for computing and storage grew 91.6% year-over-year, communication grew 54.7%, automotive grew 43.2%, industrial grew 33.3% and consumer grew 1.9%. Fourth quarter 2021 GAAP gross margin was 57.6%. Same as third quarter 2021 and 230 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2020. Our GAAP operating income was $78.6 million compared to $77.1 million reported in the third quarter of 2021 and $40.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. Fourth quarter 2021 non-GAAP gross margin was 57.9%, 10 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2021 and 220 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2020. The year-over-year expansion in fourth quarter, non-GAAP gross margin was largely due to a shift in sales mix, favoring high value greenfield products and operational efficiency gains, which more than offset higher product input costs. MPS achieved noteworthy market share gains in 2021 due in large measure to product availability and discipline sales price management. Our non-GAAP operating income was $112.0 million compared to $108.4 million reported in the prior quarter and $66.3 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. Let\u2019s review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $115.3 million in the fourth quarter compared with $109.2 million in the third quarter of 2021 and $88.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2021 operating expenses were $83.0 million up from the $78.7 we spent in the third quarter of 2021, and up from $63.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. On both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2021 litigation expense was a credit balance of $420,000 compared with a $3.4 million expense in Q3 2021 and a $1.5 million expense in Q4 2020. The credit balance in fourth quarter 2021 litigation expense reflected it an IP settlement refund of a legal retainer and lower than anticipated fees. The differences between GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense, and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Fourth quarter 2021 stock compensation expense including $921,000 charged to cost of goods sold was $31.2 million compared with $31.6 million recorded in the third quarter of 2021. Switching to the bottom line. Fourth quarter 2021 GAAP net income was 77 \u2013 $72.7 million or $1.51 per fully diluted share compared with $1.44 per share in the third quarter of 2021 and $0.90 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020. Q4 2021 non-GAAP net income was $102.1 million or $2.12 per fully diluted share, compared with of $2.06 per share in the third quarter of 2021 and $1.31 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q4 2021 will $48.2 million. Now let\u2019s look at the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021 cash, cash equivalence and investments totaled $727.5 million compared to $744.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 2021. For the fourth quarter of 2021, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $28.2 million compared with Q3 2021 operating cash flow of $117.8 million. The between quarter drop in operating cash flow primarily reflected a $51.3 million increase in inventory and higher accounts receivable. Fourth quarter 2021 capital spending totaled $17.6 million. Accounts receivable end of the fourth quarter of 2021 at $104.8 million or 28 days of sales outstanding compared with the $79.9 million or 22 days of sales outstanding reported at the end of the third quarter of 2021 and the $66.8 million or 26 days reported at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021 were $259.4 million up from the $208.1 million at the end of the third quarter of 2021. Calculated on a basis consistent with our past practice and as you can see from the webinar video, days of inventory rose to 166 days at the end of Q4 2021 from the 134 days at the end of the third quarter of 2021. Historically, we\u2019ve calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of the current quarter revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter\u2019s revenue provides better economic match. On this basis, again, we can see days of inventory increased to 152 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021 from 133 days at the end of the third quarter of 2021. I would now like to turn to our Q1 2022 outlook. We are forecasting Q1 2022 revenue in the range of $354 million to $366 million. We also expect the following. GAAP gross margin in the range of 57.4% to 58.0%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 57.7% to 58.3%. Total stock based compensation expense of $36.9 million to $38.9 million, including approximately $1.1 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $119.2 million and $123.2 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $83.4 million and $85.4 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Litigation expenses to be in the range of $2.3 million to $2.7 million. Interest income is expected to range from $1.0 million to $1.4 million before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.8 million to 48.8 million shares. Finally, I\u2019m pleased to announce a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.75 per share from $0.60 per share for stockholders of record as of March 31 2022. In conclusions, MPS\u2019 strong financial performance in 2021 was largely due to a 40% increase in fab and assembly capacity, which supported our high-value, greenfield-product, revenue ramp. Looking ahead, MPS is on track to expand capacity in 2022 well beyond $2 billion, allowing the company to successfully ramp new product revenue and achieve strategic market share gains in 2023, 2024 and beyond.\nA - Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel Nicolaus. Tore, your line is now open.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you. And congratulations on the very, very strong results. So I\u2019m going to ask this question differently. Usually, people ask you how come you carry so much inventory, this time I\u2019m going to ask you, how were you able to actually get your inventory there\u2019s that high. How are you both finding the capacity and again being able to build the inventory in spite of this very, very tight environment we\u2019re seeing in the industry?\nMichael Hsing: Well, as you know, in this business, building a inventory a qualifier fab, okay. These are now one day, two day things, enough short-term. These all we planted a few years ago. And now we are cut just the opportunity presents it and we just catch it. And nothing was short terms and okay, we couldn\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t have a crystal ball for the futures and we just react, we just plan ahead and react as fast as we can.\nBernie Blegen: And I think to add to that, that shows that we have a lot of inventory on hand that presents the capacity to allow us for sales in the next two quarters. So what we\u2019ve done is made conscious investments in inventory, in the supply chain. And what we\u2019re trying to do is manage such that we hold the inventory, we\u2019re still keeping channel in the \u2013 channel inventory lean. And we\u2019re trying to make sure to the best of our abilities that we\u2019re in touch with the inventories that our customers are keeping. So they\u2019re likewise lean.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. I also want to add and okay, as you remember and a few years ago, and I talk about it. MPS is going for well beyond million or a couple million dollars. And I wasn\u2019t joking and we plan ahead for our business. That\u2019s what we saw a few years ago and now you grow this much is, of course, we didn\u2019t expect that. But we do have a capacities and okay \u2013 and we do have to do some creative ways in the scrambling to get to 45%. And so that\u2019s all that is, like, it wasn\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t have a magic tricks and then in the last six months or so.\nBernie Blegen: And it\u2019s good as you have note \u2013 as Michael noted, we crossed the $1 billion revenue threshold and our revenue growth rate is accelerated from historic precedent.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. Well done. As my follow-up question, could you just add a little bit more color on the $2 billion worth of capacity? You\u2019ve talked about now, ramping in on 8-inch, you\u2019re also qualifying products on 12-inch. Will there actually be 12-inch product sales this year?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. We\u2019re qualifying, as you know, so MPS don\u2019t build a fab. And we don\u2019t have a lot of capital spendings and again, but we do have a increase all these capacity qualifier fabs, that cost money. And so to answer your questions, like, and we do transitions \u2013 nowadays. Okay. We get all this capacity whether it is 12-inch or 8-inch as much as we can.\nBernie Blegen: And just add to that, that was our second 12-inch fab that we brought online in 2020.\nMichael Hsing: Yes.\nTore Svanberg: Right. Very good. I\u2019ll go back in line. Thank you and congrats again.\nMichael Hsing: Okay. Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open.\nWilliam Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the odd popping results and outlook. I want to ask about the module business that you\u2019ve spoken about in the past, this thing that might even accelerate growth further over time. I\u2019m wondering what percentage of revenue modules contributes today and how we should think about the trajectory of that business. And if you could also comment on any potential tuck-in acquisitions that were either executed or contemplated for in the future to fulfill your strategy in that area. Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Okay. I\u2019m glad you asked the question, the module business I think it\u2019s a side of a 10% for this year.\nBernie Blegen: It\u2019s actually mid single digits.\nMichael Hsing: Okay. Yes, yes. And so you can quantify as a much more accurately. Okay. I don\u2019t know the others of numbers in detail. All I know is, and okay, we grow 100% every years in the last couple years. And now you using the word accelerating this years and the next couple years, that\u2019s what I see it now. And the other things, okay, the second part of your questions about acquisitions for the tuck-in technology or to enhance our future growth on the \u2013 using our MPS technology for those companies. Yes. We are engaged with handful \u2013 as a handful of a company, like, more than six companies and we\u2019re \u2013 so far we\u2019re engaging with it and nothing we \u2013 nothing materials lies. We should announce it now.\nWilliam Stein: Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Alex Vecchi of William Blair. Alex, your line is now open.\nAlex Vecchi: Thanks for taking my question. And I echo the congratulations on the outstanding results. Just maybe to expand on Tore\u2019s question with regards to the capacity expansion from $2 billion on, can you quantify how much more capacity do you think you\u2019ll be adding in the next year or two or three or the right way to think about it? I think in the past, you\u2019ve alluded to the fact that the current product portfolio can support upwards of $3 billion to $4 billion in revenues. So is that sort of the right way to think about the long-term trajectory?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. That\u2019s absolutely correct. And for the semiconductors, yes, we have to have a fab capacities for that kind of revenues. But even going the features, because we\u2019re selling more high-dollar modules and solutions and which utilizes silicons even less. So we have \u2013 we should have \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t \u2013 and our CIMIC wafer capacity even so will be less factors.\nAlex Vecchi: That\u2019s actually really helpful. And then similarly with the comments on \u2013 in terms of the segment breakdown, the Storage and Compute segment was very strong in the quarter. And I think you\u2019ve talked a little bit about enterprise notebooks. It seems like that\u2019s one of the areas, notebooks in general, where there\u2019s a little investor trepidation going forward. Can you maybe talk about what the opportunity there is and \u2013 or maybe what the SAM is for your notebook outlook over the next few years?\nBernie Blegen: Sure. I think it\u2019s important to qualify that the growth that we\u2019ve experienced, in particular over the last two, three years, has really been at the enterprise level, where we\u2019re selling into units that would retail for above $1,200. And we\u2019ve been very successful as far as capturing a large part of market share that really is not necessarily driven by consumer trends. So they\u2019re not as prone to the downward unit numbers that are being projected for notebooks.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Overall, we want to achieve a balanced growth. We don\u2019t want to be known as a notebook company. And that\u2019s MPS\u2019 strategy is diversify the growth.\nBernie Blegen: And just to pick up on Michael\u2019s point, we saw a very strong uptick in our cloud and server business, particularly in Q4, which we expect to continue to ramp into 2022.\nMichael Hsing: Overall, the notebook revenue is very, very \u2013 is a single digit now.\nAlex Vecchi: Okay. Thank you. With that, I\u2019ll hop back into queue.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.\nQuinn Bolton: Hey, guys. I offer my congratulations as well. Bernie and Michael, I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t gotten the question yet, but I followed the company for a long time. I think this is the biggest gross margin beat you guys may have ever put up. If I got my numbers right, you beat gross margin by 130 basis points in this quarter. Looking back to the third quarter, I think you had a $4 million litigation revenue in the number that drove strength in gross margin, but that was clearly a onetime issue. So can you talk first about what drove the strength in gross margins and you\u2019re guiding them effectively flat, up 10 basis points technically in the first quarter. So it looks like that margin strength continues. Can you just talk about gross margin?\nBernie Blegen: Sure. We tried to reflect on that a little bit in the prepared comments, where I indicated that we\u2019re benefiting right now by a more favorable shift in our product mix, which is higher margins on the new greenfield business, but also operational efficiencies. As far as we indicated earlier, the percentage of silicon that\u2019s coming from 12-inch, but also is a reflection of our improved quality standards. So I think that as we\u2019ve reflected on what the sustainable margin going forward that we\u2019ve offered sort of a new floor, which we look to grow again 10 to 20 basis points sequentially, although obviously, we\u2019ll keep our eyes open if there is an opportunity to have another step-up.\nMichael Hsing: If there\u2019s another side, okay. A few years ago, we talked about a greenfield product. And then you actually, I remember, asked, there is no headwind in \u2013 is there any headwind in the gross margins. So the answer was all these new products, greenfield product will aim at the high-end products and high values. And so the gross margin should be better. So this time, we didn\u2019t increase the price that much. We pretty much passed the cost to our customers or not even passed to our customers. But as Bernie said, shifted to 12-inch and also the internal efficiency improvement. And with a high gross margin product, that is the majority of the gross margin improvement.\nQuinn Bolton: Got it. And as a follow-on, for two quarters now, you\u2019ve seen a pretty nice increase in your internal inventory levels. Wondering if you could just comment, as you\u2019re building that internal inventory, how much of that is for new greenfield products versus, say, the run rate business?\nMichael Hsing: Clearly, we shifted away from a consumer side. And so that we allocated a lot of products for these high-end targeted \u2013 MPS targeted market segment. So we grow the inventories for those segments.\nBernie Blegen: I think something to add there is that we do have some high-volume business, and we\u2019re treating that as a run rate. So we\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s probably the area that has the tightest capacity. But where we have these new products, the greenfield opportunities, we have new customers and new markets as an insurance policy to make sure that they\u2019re perceived very positively and that we can cover upside potential. We have been building inventory to support that. And I think that\u2019s been reflected very well as far as the customer acceptance of the new products as well as market share gains afforded by appropriate inventory levels.\nQuinn Bolton: Got it. Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.\nRoss Seymore: I\u2019ll echo the congrats. I wanted to follow-up on the second half of your answer to Quinn\u2019s question there, Bernie. And in the past, you guys have always gained market share and very consistently so. This year was \u2013 well, this past year was no different. But you also had significantly greater availability than your competition. So I just wanted to see what the client or the customer relationship, how that\u2019s been enhanced because of the availability. Do you believe that the wins you\u2019ve gotten from availability will lead to sticky relationships going forward? You mentioned moving up into kind of first tier customer base. I\u2019m just trying to figure out the sustainability of the revenue growth because of that availability dynamic?\nMichael Hsing: That\u2019s a very, very good question. So okay, how do we grow like 45% over \u2013 close to a $1 billion base, okay? Well, you think about it, okay, all these products that we released in greenfield products and these two first-tier customers. And usually, these are large customers that they\u2019re ramping a new supply very carefully. So they don\u2019t allocate a large percentage. They always have a second source. And now we have shortage everywhere. MPS have capacities. So everything shifted to MPS. That\u2019s one factor. And the second factor is that we talk about MPS products are more programmable and our customers find out before they care less. And now they find out, our product \u2013 single product can do multiple purpose and that contributes in other factors. And so we can replace and we can \u2013 shortly, we designed \u2013 our customers redesign and the source out to adopt the MPS solutions. So \u2013 but these two points is very sticky, especially the second point, and our MPS products are more programmable, and they enjoy that. And they solve their problems and they realize the values. And so I would say they\u2019re very sticky.\nRoss Seymore: Great. And I guess as my follow-up question, I thought you talked about another greenfield opportunity, which is a huge part of the analog market which is getting into the converter side of things. Can you just talk a little bit about your aspirations there, some of the applications you\u2019re going after? And what sort of opportunity you see unfolding in that?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. We just \u2013 we did \u2013 we do have a silicon [indiscernible] and the performance is outstanding. And these are the new market segments, and these are purely in a single side, which we never have. These are internally developed. We have a group of people and they have a lot of experience, and that\u2019s a new market segment for us. So the focus will be the communications and also medical applications, like imaging, x-rays and ultrasounds and those type of things.\nBernie Blegen: And just to add, as far as the characteristics of this technology, there are not a lot of companies that have been successful with this. And the ones that have, have carved out pretty exclusive markets. And as a result of that, they command very high gross margins. So we look to be a new market entrant, but also with a very \u2013 a big competitive advantage.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. So it\u2019s \u2013 yes, it is a milestone for MPS. As so-called high-performance analog company, they tried it and they achieved a mediocre result. And now, see what we can do. And we do have a product and so for the next couple of years, and we\u2019ll see what we can do.\nRoss Seymore: Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Chris Caso from Raymond James. Chris, your line is now open.\nChris Caso: Yes, thank you. For my first question, talk a little bit about seasonality. And obviously, the Q1 results are better than what we normally expect in a seasonal Q1, and I suspect that\u2019s because of some of the capacity additions that you\u2019re bringing on. Can you talk about these capacity additions as we go through the year? Are they brought in, in the road to the $2 billion revenue level? At capacity level, is that going to come on fairly evenly during the year? Is there a step up at some point? And then when that happens, do you think that you will be fully able to meet your customer requirements presumably this year?\nBernie Blegen: Chris, I think you get credit for three questions there. Hopefully, I\u2019ll be able to keep the thread going. The first issue had to do with seasonality and generally speaking, from Q4 to Q1, we observed a modest dip. In fact, because we have such an imbalance, an unprecedented demand supply and balance, that in fact seasonality is not as much a function today as opposed to your second question, which has to do with product availability. And that\u2019s sort of the gating item for how fast a company can grow. And as Michael pointed out earlier is that as part of our company, we\u2019ve always built capacity alongside the development of our new products. So we, in fact, got out in front of this upsurge in the market and have been able to participate and, in fact, accelerate our capacity build out. And that\u2019s really a reflection of how we\u2019re looking at 2022. But I think that one thing that we\u2019ve always done is we\u2019ve had to make intelligent decisions many years ahead of when the capacity has been needed. So in fact, we\u2019re in discussions in order to be able to get capacity for 2023, 2024 and beyond. And we feel very secure in what we\u2019re capable of doing in 2022.\nMichael Hsing: Well, to answer your questions, honestly, if it gives us another 50% growth for this year, we\u2019ll be in trouble. Okay.\nChris Caso: Okay. I think that will be welcome trouble if that were the case.\nMichael Hsing: Yes.\nChris Caso: I\u2019ll take liberty to ask one more that you were nice enough to answer, Mike and Bernie, which is with regard to pricing. And Bernie, you made a comment on the call, you spoke about disciplined sales price management as I think how you termed it. Could you explain what that means and the extent to which pricing has been a contributor to year-on-year growth and whether that\u2019s something that\u2019s in the rearview mirror where you\u2019d expect to continue to increase?\nBernie Blegen: I think that most people have recognized within the semiconductors and even specific to analog that, that created an opportunity for many companies to affect price increases with their customers. And a lot of them implemented that as early as Q1 of this year. We showed \u2013 we made a conscious decision not to increase our prices on a broad base or selective market opportunities, but broadly, we did not. And we did that along with having a product availability as a means of being able to secure a higher level of market share. And so now as we look at 2022, we are going to implement selective but more broad-based price increases, but they will be at a more modest level than some of our peer companies have implemented.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, when we look at it, we invest in our customers for the future growth and for the future opportunities. And \u2013 but we do have a modest gross margin expansions as our model, okay. We keep saying it, and we have a steady state growth in every segment.\nChris Caso: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.\nRick Schafer: Hi, thanks and look \u2013 my congratulations guys on the next quarter, another nice quarter. Maybe if I could, just a quick question on 5G. I mean you guys have talked in the past about 5G as a pretty significant opportunity for MPS. I think, Michael, I think you said potentially hundreds of dollars of potential content there, sort of similar to server or data center cloud for you guys. So I don\u2019t know if you could give us any update on design momentum since or when the revenue contribution might sort of start to inflect if that\u2019s still kind of the second half of this year? And I\u2019m curious, as part of that question, are you going to see QSMOD sort of be part of that initial ramp this year? Or is it going to be more sort of point of load ECUs sort of how you began during your journey in server. If you could give any color there, that would be great.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. So to answer your first part of the question first, like I mean in the 5Gs, and I give is actually 5G \u2013 a lot of products in \u2013 especially in the high current side all relate to QSMOD. And similar technology-based product, again, we power up the 5Gs in all areas and from a single size and all the way to transmitters. And we don\u2019t see a very high rate of ramping. And so they\u2019re still steady state. And the other question is QSMOD so like I mean for the data centers. We are \u2013 this year, okay, we have to say we occupy is that still less than a single-digit of a total percentage of the total 10 of the market. But the significance is from almost nothing and to a high end of a single-digit. And earlier I said that if we don\u2019t occupy the 30% of the market, we should not be in the business. So we still have a lot of room to grow.\nBernie Blegen: And Michael, with the release of VR14 that we\u2019re in a very good inflection point on the \u2013 in the cloud and in the data center.\nRick Schafer: Yes. And Michael, just to follow that, but it took, I think, about three or four years to sort of get point of load need you share today, which I think is about 30%. So I think are you saying that\u2019s sort of a good proxy for QSMOD could be in the next couple of years?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Okay. Yes. So let\u2019s take actually longer than that, more than three or four years. And I was wondering why it so long within \u2013 in the early days, I\u2019ll say that we could grow very quickly. I didn\u2019t know what I was talking about, okay? And for the next, as Bernie mentioned, the VR14s, and VR13.5 sort of MPS accepted as other players, okay? And VR14s, I think, we have pretty good shares to start to ramp, but it\u2019s not happening now, and sometimes this year, right?\nBernie Blegen: Yes. VR13 has been delayed again, it\u2019s more likely to be Q3.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, yes, yes.\nBernie Blegen: But you are right, we\u2019ve observed in Q4 an uplift as a result of 13.5.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, yes. Okay.\nRick Schafer: Thanks. And if I could ask just a follow-up to Bernie probably. I just wanted to ask, I\u2019ve been asked in a long time. Balance sheet looks great, obviously. I was just curious if you could give us an update on use of cash going forward. I mean, obviously, you\u2019ve done a really good job of investing in future growth and R&D, but I\u2019m just curious how much you need to run the business here and feed R&D, et cetera? Thanks.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. And it\u2019s a great question because you want to look at it sort of three levels for our particular story. One is we have to keep a certain amount of cash available in order to fund our growth, particularly as it relates to receivables and inventory, but also we\u2019re expanding operating expenses worldwide at an accelerated rate. And all of those demand a level of liquidity. The next thing that we\u2019ve talked about is building infrastructure and capacity. And even though we\u2019re outsourced as far as our fabs and assembly, we do a lot of our own testing. In fact, with the quality requirements of some of the new markets we\u2019re going in, we can\u2019t outsource that. We do all of our own testing and that requires an additional investment. And then you have buildings, which, as you know, we\u2019re one of the few companies that we purchased our own footprint to house our growing staff headcount. So we\u2019re going to continue to leverage the balance sheet in order to help accelerate our growth while at the same time, as we announced in the prepared comments, we\u2019re increasing the dividend by 25%. So we\u2019re also mindful that we need to return some of the cash back to shareholders.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Well, Bernie said that said accelerated expense growth. No, we\u2019re not accelerating. No, absolutely no. Let\u2019s make that clear. And so we are pretty a little bit above our model, okay, growth \u2013 MPS growth \u2013 the expenses growth, okay? And for the return of cash to our investors, and we have an overwhelming case support for \u2013 from our investors in dividend and not buyback. So we are thought about buybacks again now, okay, we still okay, let\u2019s delay it because we get the feedback, okay, they want to divide. I don\u2019t know whether this related to a tax issue or not related, okay. So I think is in a \u2013 in the past, we said our models are consistently increased dividends, okay? And the other side of the using of cash is we want to acquire a company, not for revenue growth, is cheaper to grow MPS revenue by zone. But we can do this. So we can \u2013 MPS has a lot of garden variety of different products and can fuel some \u2013 can enhance a couple of areas to the end product. And we want to acquire those small tuck-in product, very unique and a sustainable growth and a sustainable. And based on MPS technology, we can grow those companies. And that\u2019s the company we\u2019re really interested. And so the earlier, I said were engaged with a few companies now.\nRick Schafer: Thanks for all the color guys. Congrats.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matt, your line is now open.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. Michael, I\u2019ve been asking you about this for, I don\u2019t know, three, four years. But in the last, I guess, three or four months, you guys talked a bit more about opportunities for MPS in the electric vehicle market, some in drivetrains, some in regenerative braking. I wonder if you might talk a little bit more about the revenue opportunity per car with your lead customer, the timing of that, and how wide is the pipeline in terms of the number of engagements that you might have in the EV market? Thanks.\nMichael Hsing: EV market, we are in the ADAS area, I think that we are in the ADAS 2.5 or 3.0. We almost engage with everybody. And so I can\u2019t give you numbers. For pure electrical car, MPS has about somewhere $80 to $100 shipping to date. And we\u2019re starting this year. We\u2019re starting not this year, starting actually last year. If you involve with a regenerative braking and a drive trend, those will add another over $1,000. And we don\u2019t have those revenue yet, but we do release those products.\nMatt Ramsay: Got it. Any \u2013 are those larger ASP products, any thoughts on timing?\nMichael Hsing: We are \u2013 there\u2019s several \u2013 there\u2019s many products that we are talking now, we have released a couple of them already or more than a couple of them already. And the key is we want to offer the total solutions. And customers pretty much can use MPS reference design.\nMatt Ramsay: Got it. As my follow-up question, it\u2019s a different topic. And one of the things that I\u2019ve been having investor conversations about is the broad-based industry adding \u2013 investing a ton of CapEx and adding a ton of capacity and this fear that the industry is adding it at a peak, right? You see a couple of new fabs coming online from Texas Instruments in the next number of quarters, Infineon is up in CapEx, pretty much everyone is. And so you guys have been in a unique position to have a ton of capacity come online when others have struggled to do it. And it sounds like that\u2019s going to continue for you. I just wonder, any concerns as the industry catches up with capacity, Michael? And maybe you could contrast the type of capacity, the process node that you\u2019re on, the nature of the capacity that you\u2019re bringing online for some that the rest of the industry may be adding. Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. That\u2019s a good question. So okay, you know that okay, first thing I should answer that. MPS don\u2019t build anything. We don\u2019t build anything. We don\u2019t have a fab, but we do have all the technologies. And usually, how we\u2019re getting a fab capacity is those fab are empty. And we go in there, we wonder, we say, okay, we can fill you up. It\u2019s a long-term partnership. And so \u2013 and like this year or the last year, okay, and you want to add capacity, forget it, okay? I mean those guys are busy shipment, okay? I mean, there are no fabs. And so we engage with them in the downturns. And we implement our technology. Remember, we don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not like building a fab. We don\u2019t build a fab. The cost is minimum. And \u2013 but we do have some commitment, and we do have \u2013 give some consignment on some equipment, okay. But these costs compare building a fab is much, much less. Okay.\nMatt Ramsay: Thanks very much guys. I appreciate it.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Okay.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you. Just two quick follow-ups. I know it\u2019s early in the year, but would you have \u2013 so you have four horses that are running really fast. You have one horse that\u2019s kind of just running slowly. If we look at this year, which of the horses do you think will grow a bit faster? I know there\u2019s a lot of talk about auto and server, but yes, which horses should we bet on this year?\nMichael Hsing: We don\u2019t want to be in those. MPS is all of company. Definitely not a noble company. And I think it\u2019s \u2013 we are shifting \u2013 clearly, this year, we\u2019re shifting from our consumers to \u2013 well, at least the last couple of quarters. We shifted from our consumer to automotive and server and service from a cloud computing side. And again \u2013 and so these are, for this year, probably remain similar. So okay, that\u2019s why we see it.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. And I think that when you say that we\u2019ve got five strong horses, that\u2019s a more accurate reflection because I\u2019d say that in the current year, we were surprised by the strength of Industrial. So \u2013 and I think that\u2019s going to continue on into the next year. And as we talked about earlier, the communications market, while it may not be coming on as fast as we had originally hoped for or expected, still looks very promising in the second half of this year. So I think really the thesis remains being broad-based growth.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. But in \u2013 who knows? And let\u2019s say, all these other market segments slow down and as a consumer business in every half year, we can shift it. And we can shift quickly, okay. That\u2019s \u2013 currently, it\u2019s not a favor, but we can shift quickly. And by end of the year, maybe we grow Consumer business.\nTore Svanberg: Sounds good. And coming back to the data converter topic, new segment for you. What are some of the things that we should track for your success there? We all know it\u2019s very difficult to crack into that market. And are you going into that market really, really at the high end of data converter technology? And will that be the way for us to track your success there?\nMichael Hsing: So far, yes, it\u2019s a very, very high-end product. And - but that\u2019s a new market segment. Like earlier I said \u2013 we said that we\u2019re going to ramping the data center very quickly, okay. Turn out to be \u2013 it wasn\u2019t the case, okay? So I don\u2019t want to predict that. But I know the technology is good and the test data showed we can be \u2013 we are far better than on the existing market of product.\nTore Svanberg: Great. Yes. I mean if you could even get the $100 million there, I\u2019d be very impressed.\nMichael Hsing: Oh, yes. Okay. It\u2019s a matter of time. I\u2019m confident of that. And along the way, probably we learned [indiscernible] Yes, okay.\nTore Svanberg: Okay. Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: All right. Okay.\nGenevieve Cunningham: [Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.\nBernie Blegen: Well, once again, I\u2019d like to thank you all for joining us in this conference call, and look forward to talking to you again about our first quarter, which we\u2019ll likely hold in April. So thanks again, and have a nice day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Jen. In 2021, MPS surpassed the $1 billion revenue milestone by achieving record full year revenue $1.2 billion, 43.0% higher than the prior year. This performance represented consistent execution against our strategies and being recognized by more first tiered companies for our superior technologies, product quality and excellent customer support. As we see more highly \u2013 high quality growth opportunities ahead of us, we continue to invest in our infrastructure and operational capabilities. In 2021, MPS grew capacity by 40% and we are on track to expand capacity in 2022, well beyond $2 billion allowing the company to successfully ramp new product revenue and achieve strategic market share gains. Here are a few highlights, which we achieved in 2021. Brought online a new 8 inch fab and continued to qualify parts in the 12 inch fab, we brought online in 2020. We will continue to invest in growing fab and assembly capacity. We design processor cores and MCU technology into products requiring more sophisticated power solutions such as USB power delivery, smart motor drives, and high power electrification. Our first prototype of a high precision analog digital converter product for medical applications achieved outstanding silicon performance and lab evaluations. We have started customer sampling in Q1 2022. Validation of this technology is a strong first step in developing a new business segment supporting both industrial and infrastructure end market applications. We believe new product revenue from a large number of previously released designs will ramp in 2022. The representative sample includes product supporting applications in VR14, 5G, BMS, ADAS, AI, USB PD, DDR, and many more. Turning to our full year 2021 revenue by market segment compared to 2020, automotive revenue was up 87.5% computing and storage revenue up 47.0%, industrial revenue up 54.5%, consumer revenue up 28.1% and communications revenue up 15.3% demonstrating just how broad based our full year 2021 revenue improvement was. Automotive revenue grew $95.4 million to $204.3 million in 2021. This 87.5% year-over-year gain primarily represented increased sales of our highly integrated applications supporting the digital cockpit, automotive \u2013 automated driver assistance systems and connectivity. Automotive revenue represented 16.9% of MPS' full year 2021 revenue compared with 12.9% in 2020. Full year 2021 computing and storage revenue grew $119.1 million over the prior year to $372.3 million. This 47.0% increase primarily resulted from strong sales growth for enterprise notebooks, cloud computing and storage applications. Computing and storage revenue represented 30.8% of MPS' of revenue in 2021, compared with 30.0% in 2020. Industrial revenue grew $65.2 million to $184.8 million in 2021. This 54.5% year-over-year increase was broad based with each our primary product lines enjoying better than double-digit revenue growth. Industrial revenue represented 15.3% of MPS' full year 2021 revenue, compared with 14.2% in 2020. Consumer revenue grew $61.9 million to $282.3 million reflecting increased product sales for home appliances and smart TVs. Consumer revenue represented 23.4% of MPS' full year 2021 revenue, compared with 26.1% in 2020. Communications revenue grew $21.8 million to $164.1 million. This 15.3% improvement reflected higher sales of products for both infrastructure and wireless riders and gateway applications. Communications revenue represented 13.6% of our 2021 revenue, compared with 16.9% in 2020. Switching to Q4. MPS had a record fourth quarter with revenue of $336.5 million, 4.0% higher than revenue generated in the third quarter of 2021 and 44.4% higher than the comparable quarter in 2020. By market segment, revenue for computing and storage grew 91.6% year-over-year, communication grew 54.7%, automotive grew 43.2%, industrial grew 33.3% and consumer grew 1.9%. Fourth quarter 2021 GAAP gross margin was 57.6%. Same as third quarter 2021 and 230 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2020. Our GAAP operating income was $78.6 million compared to $77.1 million reported in the third quarter of 2021 and $40.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. Fourth quarter 2021 non-GAAP gross margin was 57.9%, 10 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2021 and 220 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2020. The year-over-year expansion in fourth quarter, non-GAAP gross margin was largely due to a shift in sales mix, favoring high value greenfield products and operational efficiency gains, which more than offset higher product input costs. MPS achieved noteworthy market share gains in 2021 due in large measure to product availability and discipline sales price management. Our non-GAAP operating income was $112.0 million compared to $108.4 million reported in the prior quarter and $66.3 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $115.3 million in the fourth quarter compared with $109.2 million in the third quarter of 2021 and $88.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2021 operating expenses were $83.0 million up from the $78.7 we spent in the third quarter of 2021, and up from $63.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2020. On both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2021 litigation expense was a credit balance of $420,000 compared with a $3.4 million expense in Q3 2021 and a $1.5 million expense in Q4 2020. The credit balance in fourth quarter 2021 litigation expense reflected it an IP settlement refund of a legal retainer and lower than anticipated fees. The differences between GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense, and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Fourth quarter 2021 stock compensation expense including $921,000 charged to cost of goods sold was $31.2 million compared with $31.6 million recorded in the third quarter of 2021. Switching to the bottom line. Fourth quarter 2021 GAAP net income was 77 \u2013 $72.7 million or $1.51 per fully diluted share compared with $1.44 per share in the third quarter of 2021 and $0.90 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020. Q4 2021 non-GAAP net income was $102.1 million or $2.12 per fully diluted share, compared with of $2.06 per share in the third quarter of 2021 and $1.31 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q4 2021 will $48.2 million. Now let's look at the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021 cash, cash equivalence and investments totaled $727.5 million compared to $744.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 2021. For the fourth quarter of 2021, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $28.2 million compared with Q3 2021 operating cash flow of $117.8 million. The between quarter drop in operating cash flow primarily reflected a $51.3 million increase in inventory and higher accounts receivable. Fourth quarter 2021 capital spending totaled $17.6 million. Accounts receivable end of the fourth quarter of 2021 at $104.8 million or 28 days of sales outstanding compared with the $79.9 million or 22 days of sales outstanding reported at the end of the third quarter of 2021 and the $66.8 million or 26 days reported at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021 were $259.4 million up from the $208.1 million at the end of the third quarter of 2021. Calculated on a basis consistent with our past practice and as you can see from the webinar video, days of inventory rose to 166 days at the end of Q4 2021 from the 134 days at the end of the third quarter of 2021. Historically, we've calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of the current quarter revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's revenue provides better economic match. On this basis, again, we can see days of inventory increased to 152 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021 from 133 days at the end of the third quarter of 2021. I would now like to turn to our Q1 2022 outlook. We are forecasting Q1 2022 revenue in the range of $354 million to $366 million. We also expect the following. GAAP gross margin in the range of 57.4% to 58.0%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 57.7% to 58.3%. Total stock based compensation expense of $36.9 million to $38.9 million, including approximately $1.1 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $119.2 million and $123.2 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $83.4 million and $85.4 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation and litigation expenses. Litigation expenses to be in the range of $2.3 million to $2.7 million. Interest income is expected to range from $1.0 million to $1.4 million before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.8 million to 48.8 million shares. Finally, I'm pleased to announce a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.75 per share from $0.60 per share for stockholders of record as of March 31 2022. In conclusions, MPS' strong financial performance in 2021 was largely due to a 40% increase in fab and assembly capacity, which supported our high-value, greenfield-product, revenue ramp. Looking ahead, MPS is on track to expand capacity in 2022 well beyond $2 billion, allowing the company to successfully ramp new product revenue and achieve strategic market share gains in 2023, 2024 and beyond. And I think to add to that, that shows that we have a lot of inventory on hand that presents the capacity to allow us for sales in the next two quarters. So what we've done is made conscious investments in inventory, in the supply chain. And what we're trying to do is manage such that we hold the inventory, we're still keeping channel in the \u2013 channel inventory lean. And we're trying to make sure to the best of our abilities that we're in touch with the inventories that our customers are keeping. So they're likewise lean. And it's good as you have note \u2013 as Michael noted, we crossed the $1 billion revenue threshold and our revenue growth rate is accelerated from historic precedent. And just add to that, that was our second 12-inch fab that we brought online in 2020. It's actually mid single digits. Sure. I think it's important to qualify that the growth that we've experienced, in particular over the last two, three years, has really been at the enterprise level, where we're selling into units that would retail for above $1,200. And we've been very successful as far as capturing a large part of market share that really is not necessarily driven by consumer trends. So they're not as prone to the downward unit numbers that are being projected for notebooks. And just to pick up on Michael's point, we saw a very strong uptick in our cloud and server business, particularly in Q4, which we expect to continue to ramp into 2022. Sure. We tried to reflect on that a little bit in the prepared comments, where I indicated that we're benefiting right now by a more favorable shift in our product mix, which is higher margins on the new greenfield business, but also operational efficiencies. As far as we indicated earlier, the percentage of silicon that's coming from 12-inch, but also is a reflection of our improved quality standards. So I think that as we've reflected on what the sustainable margin going forward that we've offered sort of a new floor, which we look to grow again 10 to 20 basis points sequentially, although obviously, we'll keep our eyes open if there is an opportunity to have another step-up. I think something to add there is that we do have some high-volume business, and we're treating that as a run rate. So we're \u2013 it's probably the area that has the tightest capacity. But where we have these new products, the greenfield opportunities, we have new customers and new markets as an insurance policy to make sure that they're perceived very positively and that we can cover upside potential. We have been building inventory to support that. And I think that's been reflected very well as far as the customer acceptance of the new products as well as market share gains afforded by appropriate inventory levels. And just to add, as far as the characteristics of this technology, there are not a lot of companies that have been successful with this. And the ones that have, have carved out pretty exclusive markets. And as a result of that, they command very high gross margins. So we look to be a new market entrant, but also with a very \u2013 a big competitive advantage. Chris, I think you get credit for three questions there. Hopefully, I'll be able to keep the thread going. The first issue had to do with seasonality and generally speaking, from Q4 to Q1, we observed a modest dip. In fact, because we have such an imbalance, an unprecedented demand supply and balance, that in fact seasonality is not as much a function today as opposed to your second question, which has to do with product availability. And that's sort of the gating item for how fast a company can grow. And as Michael pointed out earlier is that as part of our company, we've always built capacity alongside the development of our new products. So we, in fact, got out in front of this upsurge in the market and have been able to participate and, in fact, accelerate our capacity build out. And that's really a reflection of how we're looking at 2022. But I think that one thing that we've always done is we've had to make intelligent decisions many years ahead of when the capacity has been needed. So in fact, we're in discussions in order to be able to get capacity for 2023, 2024 and beyond. And we feel very secure in what we're capable of doing in 2022. I think that most people have recognized within the semiconductors and even specific to analog that, that created an opportunity for many companies to affect price increases with their customers. And a lot of them implemented that as early as Q1 of this year. We showed \u2013 we made a conscious decision not to increase our prices on a broad base or selective market opportunities, but broadly, we did not. And we did that along with having a product availability as a means of being able to secure a higher level of market share. And so now as we look at 2022, we are going to implement selective but more broad-based price increases, but they will be at a more modest level than some of our peer companies have implemented. And Michael, with the release of VR14 that we're in a very good inflection point on the \u2013 in the cloud and in the data center. Yes. VR13 has been delayed again, it's more likely to be Q3. But you are right, we've observed in Q4 an uplift as a result of 13.5. Yes. And it's a great question because you want to look at it sort of three levels for our particular story. One is we have to keep a certain amount of cash available in order to fund our growth, particularly as it relates to receivables and inventory, but also we're expanding operating expenses worldwide at an accelerated rate. And all of those demand a level of liquidity. The next thing that we've talked about is building infrastructure and capacity. And even though we're outsourced as far as our fabs and assembly, we do a lot of our own testing. In fact, with the quality requirements of some of the new markets we're going in, we can't outsource that. We do all of our own testing and that requires an additional investment. And then you have buildings, which, as you know, we're one of the few companies that we purchased our own footprint to house our growing staff headcount. So we're going to continue to leverage the balance sheet in order to help accelerate our growth while at the same time, as we announced in the prepared comments, we're increasing the dividend by 25%. So we're also mindful that we need to return some of the cash back to shareholders. Yes. And I think that when you say that we've got five strong horses, that's a more accurate reflection because I'd say that in the current year, we were surprised by the strength of Industrial. So \u2013 and I think that's going to continue on into the next year. And as we talked about earlier, the communications market, while it may not be coming on as fast as we had originally hoped for or expected, still looks very promising in the second half of this year. So I think really the thesis remains being broad-based growth. Well, once again, I'd like to thank you all for joining us in this conference call, and look forward to talking to you again about our first quarter, which we'll likely hold in April. So thanks again, and have a nice day."

            "name": "Michael Hsing",
            "content": "Well, as you know, in this business, building a inventory a qualifier fab, okay. These are now one day, two day things, enough short-term. These all we planted a few years ago. And now we are cut just the opportunity presents it and we just catch it. And nothing was short terms and okay, we couldn't \u2013 we don't have a crystal ball for the futures and we just react, we just plan ahead and react as fast as we can. Yes. I also want to add and okay, as you remember and a few years ago, and I talk about it. MPS is going for well beyond million or a couple million dollars. And I wasn't joking and we plan ahead for our business. That's what we saw a few years ago and now you grow this much is, of course, we didn't expect that. But we do have a capacities and okay \u2013 and we do have to do some creative ways in the scrambling to get to 45%. And so that's all that is, like, it wasn't \u2013 we don't have a magic tricks and then in the last six months or so. Yes. We're qualifying, as you know, so MPS don't build a fab. And we don't have a lot of capital spendings and again, but we do have a increase all these capacity qualifier fabs, that cost money. And so to answer your questions, like, and we do transitions \u2013 nowadays. Okay. We get all this capacity whether it is 12-inch or 8-inch as much as we can. Yes. Okay. Thank you. Yes. Okay. I'm glad you asked the question, the module business I think it's a side of a 10% for this year. Okay. Yes, yes. And so you can quantify as a much more accurately. Okay. I don't know the others of numbers in detail. All I know is, and okay, we grow 100% every years in the last couple years. And now you using the word accelerating this years and the next couple years, that's what I see it now. And the other things, okay, the second part of your questions about acquisitions for the tuck-in technology or to enhance our future growth on the \u2013 using our MPS technology for those companies. Yes. We are engaged with handful \u2013 as a handful of a company, like, more than six companies and we're \u2013 so far we're engaging with it and nothing we \u2013 nothing materials lies. We should announce it now. Yes. That's absolutely correct. And for the semiconductors, yes, we have to have a fab capacities for that kind of revenues. But even going the features, because we're selling more high-dollar modules and solutions and which utilizes silicons even less. So we have \u2013 we should have \u2013 we shouldn't \u2013 and our CIMIC wafer capacity even so will be less factors. Yes. Overall, we want to achieve a balanced growth. We don't want to be known as a notebook company. And that's MPS' strategy is diversify the growth. Overall, the notebook revenue is very, very \u2013 is a single digit now. If there's another side, okay. A few years ago, we talked about a greenfield product. And then you actually, I remember, asked, there is no headwind in \u2013 is there any headwind in the gross margins. So the answer was all these new products, greenfield product will aim at the high-end products and high values. And so the gross margin should be better. So this time, we didn't increase the price that much. We pretty much passed the cost to our customers or not even passed to our customers. But as Bernie said, shifted to 12-inch and also the internal efficiency improvement. And with a high gross margin product, that is the majority of the gross margin improvement. Clearly, we shifted away from a consumer side. And so that we allocated a lot of products for these high-end targeted \u2013 MPS targeted market segment. So we grow the inventories for those segments. That's a very, very good question. So okay, how do we grow like 45% over \u2013 close to a $1 billion base, okay? Well, you think about it, okay, all these products that we released in greenfield products and these two first-tier customers. And usually, these are large customers that they're ramping a new supply very carefully. So they don't allocate a large percentage. They always have a second source. And now we have shortage everywhere. MPS have capacities. So everything shifted to MPS. That's one factor. And the second factor is that we talk about MPS products are more programmable and our customers find out before they care less. And now they find out, our product \u2013 single product can do multiple purpose and that contributes in other factors. And so we can replace and we can \u2013 shortly, we designed \u2013 our customers redesign and the source out to adopt the MPS solutions. So \u2013 but these two points is very sticky, especially the second point, and our MPS products are more programmable, and they enjoy that. And they solve their problems and they realize the values. And so I would say they're very sticky. Yes. We just \u2013 we did \u2013 we do have a silicon [indiscernible] and the performance is outstanding. And these are the new market segments, and these are purely in a single side, which we never have. These are internally developed. We have a group of people and they have a lot of experience, and that's a new market segment for us. So the focus will be the communications and also medical applications, like imaging, x-rays and ultrasounds and those type of things. Yes. So it's \u2013 yes, it is a milestone for MPS. As so-called high-performance analog company, they tried it and they achieved a mediocre result. And now, see what we can do. And we do have a product and so for the next couple of years, and we'll see what we can do. Well, to answer your questions, honestly, if it gives us another 50% growth for this year, we'll be in trouble. Okay. Yes. Yes, when we look at it, we invest in our customers for the future growth and for the future opportunities. And \u2013 but we do have a modest gross margin expansions as our model, okay. We keep saying it, and we have a steady state growth in every segment. Yes. So to answer your first part of the question first, like I mean in the 5Gs, and I give is actually 5G \u2013 a lot of products in \u2013 especially in the high current side all relate to QSMOD. And similar technology-based product, again, we power up the 5Gs in all areas and from a single size and all the way to transmitters. And we don't see a very high rate of ramping. And so they're still steady state. And the other question is QSMOD so like I mean for the data centers. We are \u2013 this year, okay, we have to say we occupy is that still less than a single-digit of a total percentage of the total 10 of the market. But the significance is from almost nothing and to a high end of a single-digit. And earlier I said that if we don't occupy the 30% of the market, we should not be in the business. So we still have a lot of room to grow. Yes. Okay. Yes. So let's take actually longer than that, more than three or four years. And I was wondering why it so long within \u2013 in the early days, I'll say that we could grow very quickly. I didn't know what I was talking about, okay? And for the next, as Bernie mentioned, the VR14s, and VR13.5 sort of MPS accepted as other players, okay? And VR14s, I think, we have pretty good shares to start to ramp, but it's not happening now, and sometimes this year, right? Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes. Okay. Yes. Well, Bernie said that said accelerated expense growth. No, we're not accelerating. No, absolutely no. Let's make that clear. And so we are pretty a little bit above our model, okay, growth \u2013 MPS growth \u2013 the expenses growth, okay? And for the return of cash to our investors, and we have an overwhelming case support for \u2013 from our investors in dividend and not buyback. So we are thought about buybacks again now, okay, we still okay, let's delay it because we get the feedback, okay, they want to divide. I don't know whether this related to a tax issue or not related, okay. So I think is in a \u2013 in the past, we said our models are consistently increased dividends, okay? And the other side of the using of cash is we want to acquire a company, not for revenue growth, is cheaper to grow MPS revenue by zone. But we can do this. So we can \u2013 MPS has a lot of garden variety of different products and can fuel some \u2013 can enhance a couple of areas to the end product. And we want to acquire those small tuck-in product, very unique and a sustainable growth and a sustainable. And based on MPS technology, we can grow those companies. And that's the company we're really interested. And so the earlier, I said were engaged with a few companies now. EV market, we are in the ADAS area, I think that we are in the ADAS 2.5 or 3.0. We almost engage with everybody. And so I can't give you numbers. For pure electrical car, MPS has about somewhere $80 to $100 shipping to date. And we're starting this year. We're starting not this year, starting actually last year. If you involve with a regenerative braking and a drive trend, those will add another over $1,000. And we don't have those revenue yet, but we do release those products. We are \u2013 there's several \u2013 there's many products that we are talking now, we have released a couple of them already or more than a couple of them already. And the key is we want to offer the total solutions. And customers pretty much can use MPS reference design. Yes. That's a good question. So okay, you know that okay, first thing I should answer that. MPS don't build anything. We don't build anything. We don't have a fab, but we do have all the technologies. And usually, how we're getting a fab capacity is those fab are empty. And we go in there, we wonder, we say, okay, we can fill you up. It's a long-term partnership. And so \u2013 and like this year or the last year, okay, and you want to add capacity, forget it, okay? I mean those guys are busy shipment, okay? I mean, there are no fabs. And so we engage with them in the downturns. And we implement our technology. Remember, we don't \u2013 it's not like building a fab. We don't build a fab. The cost is minimum. And \u2013 but we do have some commitment, and we do have \u2013 give some consignment on some equipment, okay. But these costs compare building a fab is much, much less. Okay. Yes. Okay. We don't want to be in those. MPS is all of company. Definitely not a noble company. And I think it's \u2013 we are shifting \u2013 clearly, this year, we're shifting from our consumers to \u2013 well, at least the last couple of quarters. We shifted from our consumer to automotive and server and service from a cloud computing side. And again \u2013 and so these are, for this year, probably remain similar. So okay, that's why we see it. Yes. But in \u2013 who knows? And let's say, all these other market segments slow down and as a consumer business in every half year, we can shift it. And we can shift quickly, okay. That's \u2013 currently, it's not a favor, but we can shift quickly. And by end of the year, maybe we grow Consumer business. So far, yes, it's a very, very high-end product. And - but that's a new market segment. Like earlier I said \u2013 we said that we're going to ramping the data center very quickly, okay. Turn out to be \u2013 it wasn't the case, okay? So I don't want to predict that. But I know the technology is good and the test data showed we can be \u2013 we are far better than on the existing market of product. Oh, yes. Okay. It's a matter of time. I'm confident of that. And along the way, probably we learned [indiscernible] Yes, okay. All right. Okay."

Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for one year on our Investor Relations page at www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, as CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. During this webinar, we will discuss our Q3 2021 financial results and guidance for Q4 2021, followed by a Q&A session.  In the course of today's webinar, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the safe harbor statements contained in the Q3 2021 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2021, and our Form 10-Q filed on August 9, 2021, which are accessible through our website, www.monolithicpower.com. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, interest and other income, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC. I would refer investors to the Q3 2020, Q2 2021 and Q3 2021 releases as well as to the reconciling tables that are posted on our website. Now I would like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.\nBernie Blegen: Thanks, Jen. MPS achieved record third quarter revenue of $323.5 million, 10.3% higher than revenue in the second quarter of 2021 and 24.7% higher than the comparable quarter in 2020. Looking at our revenue by market, third quarter 2021 industrial revenue of $52.2 million increased 20.5% from the second quarter of 2021, due primarily to increased revenue for industrial meters and power sources. Industrial revenue represented 16.1% of our total third quarter 2021 revenue. Third quarter 2021 communications revenue of $44.7 million was up 19.3% from the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to increased infrastructure demand. Communication sales represented 13.8% of our total third quarter 2021 revenue. In our computing and storage market, third quarter revenue of $98.6 million increased $10.9 million or 12.4% from the second quarter of 2021. The sequential quarterly revenue growth primarily reflected sales gains in storage applications. Computing and storage revenue represented 30.5% of MPS' third quarter 2021 revenue. Third quarter automotive revenue of $54.4 million grew $5.7 million or 11.7% over the second quarter of 2021. This improvement reflects continued gains in applications for infotainment, lighting and ADAS. Automotive revenue was 16.8% of MPS' total third quarter 2021 revenue. In our consumer markets, third quarter 2021 revenue of $73.6 million fell 3.3% from revenue reported in the second quarter of 2021. This decrease in consumer revenue reflected lower handset sales. Consumer revenue represented 22.8% of our third quarter 2021 revenue. Third quarter 2021 GAAP gross margin was 57.6%, which was 160 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2021 and 245 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2020. Non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter of 2021 was 57.8%, 148 basis points higher than the gross margin percentage reported from the second quarter of 2021 and 231 basis points higher than the third quarter from a year ago. Third quarter 2021 gross margin on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis included a $4 million litigation settlement. Excluding this onetime benefit, non-GAAP gross margin would have been 56.6%, essentially flat with the second quarter of 2021 and 110 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2020. Our GAAP operating income was $77.1 million compared to $60.6 million reported in the second quarter of 2021 and $60.0 million reported in the third quarter of 2020. Our third quarter 2021 non-GAAP operating income was $108.4 million compared to $94.9 million reported in the prior quarter and $84.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2020. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $109.2 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with $103.6 million in the second quarter of 2021 and $83.1 million in the third quarter of 2020. Our non-GAAP third quarter 2021 operating expenses were $78.7 million, up from the $70.3 million we spent in the second quarter of 2021 and up from the $59.1 million reported in the third quarter of 2020. The sequential increase in Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses primarily reflected in increased spending in R&D for qualifying parts for production and securing foundry capacity. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the third quarter of 2021, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $922,000 charged cost of goods sold was $31.6 million, compared with $32.1 million recorded in the second quarter of 2021. Switching to the bottom line. Third quarter 2021 GAAP net income was $68.8 million or $1.44 per fully diluted share compared with $55.2 million or $1.16 per share in the second quarter of 2021 and $55.6 million or $1.18 per share in the third quarter of 2020. Q3 non-GAAP net income was $98.6 million or $2.06 per fully diluted share compared with $86.5 million or $1.81 per share in the second quarter of 2021 and $79.4 million or $1.69 per share in the third quarter of 2020. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q3 2021 were 47.9 million. Now, let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $744.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 2021 compared to $672.9 million at the end of the second quarter of 2021. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $117.8 million, compared with Q2 2021 operating cash flow of $96.9 million. Third quarter 2021 capital spending totaled $18.6 million. Accounts receivable ended the third quarter of 2021 at $79.9 million, representing 22 days of sales outstanding which was two days lower than the 24 days reported at the end of the second quarter of 2021 and 11 days lower than the 33 days at the end of the third quarter of 2020. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2021 were $208.1 million, up $30.8 million from the $177.3 million reported at the end of the second quarter of 2021. Inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2021 represented 134 days, which were nine days higher than at the end of the second quarter of 2021. Historically, we have calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of the current quarter revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's revenue provides a better economic match. On this basis, you can see inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2021 represented 135 days, 18 days higher than the 117 days at the end of the second quarter of 2021 and six days higher than the 129 days at the end of the third quarter of 2020. Currently, our inventory levels remain lean. We are working very hard to return inventory to the 180 day to 200 day level necessary to support our future growth. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2021. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $314 million to $326 million. We also expect the following: GAAP gross margin in the range of 56.0% to 56.6%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 56.3% to 56.9%; total stock-based compensation expense of $30.8 million to $32.8 million, including approximately $950,000 that we'd be charged to cost of goods sold. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses should be between $107.8 million and $111.8 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $77.9 million to $79.9 million. Litigation expense is expected to be in the range of $3.5 million to $3.9 million. Interest income is expected to range from $1.0 million to $1.4 million. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.9 million to 48.9 million shares. In conclusion, we are continuing to execute our strategy. I will now open the webinar up for questions.\nA - Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie and analyst. I would now like to begin our Q&A session.  Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you and congratulations on these continued stellar results. First question, and not to, sort of, pick on segments there, but your consumer segment was down sequentially, and you talked about cellphone. I wasn't aware -- we don't think power had that much exposure to cellphones. Is this mainly on the charger side or anything else there that we should be aware of?\nMichael Hsing: Hi, Tore. Yes, I think, It is on the charger side. And we do these fast chargings, and we picked up some revenues in the last few years in those cellphone companies. And they thought that they can have a more adoption in the market. So they have some inventories, but it's an unusual way of charging of phones and that came in still not very popular.\nTore Svanberg: Great. Thanks for clarifying that. And as my follow-up, you have a luxury problem now. You have about $0.75 billion in cash on your balance sheet. I know you're out there trying to secure more capacity. So first of all, could you update us on where you are on securing capacity, especially for the next few years? And related to that, will you start to use some of that cash more aggressively to potentially buying more equipment as you continue to obviously show very strong growth? Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: All right. Let me answer the first part first. It is -- the expansion is still on track, okay. And the fab issues, we don't have -- we have less fab issues. And we came -- we are on the way to expand our capacity in sometimes in the middle or -- middle of the next year to over $2 billion -- supporting $2 billion of sales. But at the same times, we do have to buy more equipment for testing, for qualifications and also, we need to hire more people. And as you know, to qualify each part it takes time. And the revenues there, opportunities there, it's just a matter of time. And so the second part is buying more equipment. On the other hand, as an investor, our shareholders, investors are very critical about our -- criticized in the past our spending, okay? I mean, we are out of -- we are slightly out of our model now, okay, and I -- we spend money on -- what I mean, a lot more careful, okay? But the opportunity is there, but we do more sensibly.\nBernie Blegen: Yeah. And I think if I can just add to Michael's comment there is that as far as the model that we've always pursued, it was to have our fab partners and our assembly house partners absorb much of the capital required in order to build up capacity, and that remains our being as a fabless company. So nothing has changed in our model. We're just adapting it to this rate of growth that we're enjoying right now.\nTore Svanberg: Thanks again. I\u2019ll go back in line.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matt, your line is now open.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. For my first question, Michael, I wanted to ask about a couple of the different computing markets that you guys have product to support. The first one, I think you could -- I don't know, from my perspective, if you could kind of drive a bus through what different PC expectations are for next year. And I wonder if you might touch on what -- rough percentage, Bernie, of revenue might come from the notebook market? And what your underlying planning assumptions are on the PC market for next year? And I guess, in contrast to that, how -- Intel is launching Sapphire Rapids, AMD is launching Genoa next year. What kind of a tailwind from a content perspective could those upgrades in the server market be? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks guys.\nMichael Hsing: Okay. For the notebook side, obviously, we gained some market shares in the high-end notebook in this -- after the pandemic, okay, or it was still the tail end of the pandemic. And we increased quite a bit of our market share. And -- but the story there is not -- it's not just we're gaining, that's all we can get. We -- as we increased our new generation with our technologies that's in place, and we will further reduce the cost, and we will address the high-end of our consumer side. And allow me if I address the -- answered your questions, Matthew. And on the server side, we are still a very, very small players. There's a lot more room for MPS to gain.\nBernie Blegen: Yeah. And I don't think that we've ever specifically broken out what percent of the group's revenue is tied to any one of the categories that we track. But I think we have been clear that in each of the last two years, that the growth in notebooks has outpaced the rest of the sectors, including server and storage. Now having said that, one of the things that we're benefiting from is that diversification of how we're positioned in this group. As Michael indicated, we are a relatively small player when it comes to core power management for servers and we believe that with both the next generation of Intel and AMD processor releases, that we stand to benefit from market share gains. And in the more near-term element, as we called out in Q3, we're actually seeing a nice increase in storage sales, which is usually a precursor to ongoing infrastructure spending within the data centers. So I think that we're having a great difficulty, as anybody, in understanding when work from home or work from work, as it relates to notebooks, begins or ends. But I think that we're well positioned because of our diversification to enjoy continued growth in this category for a number of years.\nMatt Ramsay: Yes. Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: Let me go back to the notebook side that I can -- I think that part of the question, I didn't answer. And again, we're still facing shortages and still a lot of demand in the notebook side. And we don't see the -- we see revenues from -- in the middle of the next year even.\nMatt Ramsay: Got it. Thank you very much for all that commentary guys. Just a quick couple of things on gross margin. One, Bernie, the one-timer that was in Q3, any particular reason you didn't pull that out of the non-GAAP number? And secondly, with the pricing environment that we're feeling today, how do you guys think about price increases going forward relative to input costs and what that could mean to margins? Thank you very much.\nBernie Blegen: I'll take the first half of that question real quickly. And then Michael will give comments on the second. As far as how we try to manage GAAP and non-GAAP reporting, is really to be a reflection of what is cash. And in this case, we highlighted that there was a settlement, and that was a cash payment that we received. And so that's the thinking behind not adjusting it as a non-GAAP item. Conversely so, if we have something that works to our detriment and it also has cash implications, we wouldn't non-GAAP that out either. So the two areas that we stay pretty closely to, or three, I should say, are only stock comp, gain and loss from a deferred comp plan and if we have any intangible acquisition amortization.\nMichael Hsing: Okay. The second part is how it affected our gross margins on the current supply shortages. I think, as I said, all these new -- well, let me say this, yes, we do see the cost increase in, fortunately, in all the product that we released have gained market shares as all these greenfield products. We started to gain momentum a couple of years ago. And these all have higher margins. And our customers give us a very long-term forecast commitment, and we honor those. We can absorb some in -- some of the cost and -- because the way these products have a much higher margins. And -- so during this time, we value the customer relationship and we don't gouge price.\nGenevieve Cunningham: All right. Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.\nRoss Seymore: Thanks for letting me ask a question. Congrats on continued strong reports and guides. One question on an end market. The communications side, Bernie or Michael, you guys said that, that was up because of infrastructure. That's been a really choppy market for you guys between the infrastructure side going on and off and then the kind of the access side. Can you just talk a little bit more about what you meant by the infrastructure side? And is that the start of something that's going to continue, or should you expect that segment to continue to be lumpy going forward?\nMichael Hsing: Well, Ross, you know then that we're transitioning from a these Wi-Fi routers and those to more in real infrastructures like I mean in data centers or these communication between the data centers and the switchers and even towers. So the last years, our customers are pulling a lot of revenues. And this time, then we see all the other things are going like 5Gs and including the commercial Wi-Fi systems and then and \u2013 where we play a critical role on these in these areas. And we see the expansions, and we will see a further \u2013 continue to expand in the next few quarters.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. I think we remain very optimistic about our long-term positioning within the communication sector and in particular, infrastructure as it relates to 5G. But I think that right now, we have not hit a constant investment cadence on the part of the carriers in either Europe or North America. So we think that as that starts to gain momentum and gets more predictable, we're very well positioned to participate in that.\nRoss Seymore: Thanks for that color. I guess as my follow-up, seasonality versus kind of cyclicality and/or supply-driven moves. Obviously, your fourth quarter has guided a bit better than your traditional seasonality kind of flattish this year. But how are you thinking about that as we go into next year and beyond? Is it mainly going to be driven by the product cycles you have in short supply in aggregate? So those would be big tailwinds, or do you believe seasonality is going to become a framework that's something that investors should consider as we go into 2022?\nMichael Hsing: Well, Ross, you see the \u2013 this market is an exceptionally strong market, I mean. And like I mean, a lot of demand is everywhere, so like I mean, also are constrained by the supply. And we do have a delinquencies. And I mean, but that's we're facing delinquency for many quarters, like I mean \u2013 and for \u2013 I think we still have the \u2013 my opinion is that we still have some kind of seasonality in fourth quarters because all these holidays, all these and it will kind of affect us. And so we see the \u2013 as I said earlier, we see the demand is still very strong. So like I mean we're just cautious, and we are on our guidance.\nRoss Seymore: And just to add to that is that right now, what we are continuing to do is investing and expanding our capacity because we do believe that this robust demand that we're experiencing will continue, and we want to be able to participate, optimize to the best of our ability, this growth opportunity.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, let me clarify the shortages, okay. All these \u2013 what I mean with shortage is that we have a few thousand products and always have some mixed issues. And as we don't have a serious \u2013 we don't have fab capacity issues. And \u2013 but all these are mixed in the \u2013 for particular product that we may have \u2013 we have a few products that have a \u2013 are facing shortages now. So \u2013 and as we transfer to a different fab, it just takes time to qualify this.\nRoss Seymore: Got it. Thanks, guys.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Alex Vecchi of William Blair. Alex, your line is now open.\nAlex Vecchi: Hey, guys. Congratulations on the strong results. Maybe just to piggyback on Ross' question a little bit with seasonality. Bernie, can you give a little color on how we should think about the sequential growth rate by end market for Q4 in terms of maybe strongest end market to weakest?\nBernie Blegen: Sure. So, when you look at Q4, I think that the two primary drivers are going to be computing and continuation of automotive. And then you would normally expect and we expect to see a slight downturn in consumer. So, I think many of the trend lines that we're familiar with are continuing and ongoing, but the amplitude might be a little up or down from what the traditional seasonality has been.\nAlex Vecchi: Great. that's helpful. And then similarly, I think on the communications line as well over the last couple of quarters, I believe you guys have pointed to ramp up to that Tier 2 5G OEMs. How should we be thinking about the opportunity eventually next year to crack into a Tier 1, or just generally, how to think about how you're positioned there geographically?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. We are designing all -- in all Tier 1s now. And we are so small still like I mean in these big growing market segments. As you know, we don't have anything in 4G, and we expect that we'll be a significant players in there.\nAlex Vecchi: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. With that, I'll go back in queue.\nMichael Hsing: Okay.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.\nQuinn Bolton: Hi guys. Let me offer my congratulations. Michael or Bernie, I guess I wanted to -- I know there have been a lot of disruptions in Southeast Asia, more on the package and test side. Wondering if you could just say whether or not you have any exposure to Malaysia subcons and whether that affected your ability to ship or receive products here in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter looking forward?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. There's not so much that affected it. Maybe some products, not I mean -- because we control a lot of our -- the new product, we control our own package technologies. And so we always qualify in a different locations. And so we came in that -- the Southeast Asia problems, okay, we can go through it. We didn't have that much of issues.\nBernie Blegen: Correct, in either Q3 or our outlook for Q4.\nMichael Hsing: Yes.\nQuinn Bolton: Got it. My second question just on the supply chain is it sounds like from your comments, you're not seeing some of the fab constraints that you'd seen earlier. And inventory increased by $30 million sequentially. I guess my question is, as that capacity comes online, as you ramp inventory on hand, do you think that, that could lead to an acceleration in your ability to meet former delinquencies and see revenue growth rate potentially accelerate as you meet some of those delinquencies, or it -- does it really all come down to that product mix of what customers are demanding versus what you have in inventory that you see that mismatch potentially continuing for several quarters?\nMichael Hsing: Yes, to answer your question, as today, absolutely. And we have a lot more we can chew off now. And as the shortages go on or the new product adoptions in all the greenfield products that we ramp up much, much faster than we expected, and we have a normal out-of-forecast orders and we cannot fulfill. And these ones, our customers understand that. I mean -- and so we -- so now, as of today, we have a blue skies. And -- but doesn't mean -- we're not regulators, so I can't forecast it.\nBernie Blegen: Just to add, it's a balancing act, as you can appreciate, because for some of the more mature products that we have, they already have developed markets and a fairly predictable growth in the current market. But what we're trying to do is make sure that these new product introductions can be successful, because that is going to be the future growth opportunity for the company. So, we're trying to satisfy sort of the run rate business in this heightened demand, a period of heightened demand, and at the same time, have very successful new product launches with new customers.\nQuinn Bolton: Got it. Can I squeeze one last one in? Do you guys have any meaningful exposure to Chromebooks? And is that a share gain opportunity as you look into 2022? Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, we have. And it's -- if we have a local product, we might as well make them and go design, I mean, everywhere.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. Chromebooks are unique, because while they're considered a -- we tend to go after high-value notebooks, and Chromebooks are known to be lower priced. But they depend on the access to the cloud and good processing power. So the power management, our power management solution is very key. It's a high value for the Chromebooks.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. As I said earlier, as our technologies bring online in -- become more mature, so that can mean why not just attacking all these other markets that we're not in.\nQuinn Bolton: Yes. Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: Yes.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open.\nQ \u2013 William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the great results and outlook. I'm -- I want to ask one question about supply chain stuff and one about long-term growth. First, on the supply chain, it seems -- certainly, if we look not just at your business but across semis, that customers have been in sort of freak-out expedite mode for quite some time. I wonder if you could give us a sense as to whether that abated at all. Did the level or breadth of expedite requests change meaningfully in the quarter? Is it getting hotter or colder in any end market with regard to this sort of urgency of expedites and pull-ins and upsides and all that activity we've heard about? And then again, I have a long-term growth question.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Okay. The answer is okay. I wish that they come down a little bit, then I mean -- and that they're exactly the same as the last quarter and the quarter before. And -- yes, okay.\nWilliam Stein: Okay. So the long-term growth question, Michael, I think we've discussed this many times, but we're aware that there's this long-term potential to transition to more of a solutions provider with modules relative to your traditional semi device business. Can you talk about the trajectory of growth of the modules business? An update on perhaps percent of revenues today relative to a quarter ago and where you think it -- that could go over time? Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. I -- our homegrown modules, okay, well, all this strategy, there's MPS involved. There are a lot of technicals in the gate in terms of delivering the end product. Okay, it feels -- there's no end project, it's a mid product, as I feel it well. So our strategies are move up to a food games. And since we put -- we have the knowledge and why win are not captured all the values. And for currently -- current, our module growth, okay, I mean it's much faster than other semiconductors side or selling the chips. But the volume overall is still very small, so like I mean, compare the entire revenues. We tried it different ways in like a launch our websites and like a NPS analyses. And then, they're also using e-commerce, okay? These are doing well. And -- but -- now I'm thinking about it, why we're just applying companies, like I mean, -- and we know that, we need to gain knowledge, gain sales channels, like I mean -- and have those company adopting an MPS technology, we can provide them with better tools, again. And I think the first field attempt in -- are very, very, very encouraging. So like I mean, obviously, I can't talk the detail now. So again, -- and I think that's our strategy.\nBernie Blegen: And if I can just remind you, Will that we talked about this -- touched on it last quarter. And we indicated that what we're trying to do is source different technologies through either IP acquisitions or talent acquisitions that are complementary to our business. And that will accelerate our ability to be a solutions provider for our customers in the next seven, eight years.\nMichael Hsing: Yeah. I just don't like it. We have so much knowledge to put an end to it. And in the end, we sell a piece of silicon averaging well below $1, okay? We should sell our solutions at much more than $1, so like a $5, $6, $10, those type of things. And those customers will really appreciate it. They don't have to design from scratch.\nWilliam Stein: That's helpful insight. Thank you both.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.\nWei Mok: Hi. Good afternoon. This is Wei Mok on the call for Rick Schafer. I just wanted to echo congrats on the results. So for my first question, it's in regards to auto, so it's pretty much well known that the market is supply constrained though you guys are still growing nearly 90% this year. With industry reports showing vehicle unit production improving in 2022, how should we think about your auto business as we look into 2022?\nMichael Hsing: Well, it's a very -- at this time, we see everything is very rosy now. And we -- but on the other hand, in -- we are so small. There's no reason, we would not grow, even the downturns. And as we have looked at the addressable market is that this is like over $6 billion, okay? I mean that's conservatively numbers. That's a conservative numbers. And as we introduce more products in especially in ADAS and the EV proportion size. And, okay, we are developing products. I mean, all of these, and again, we can address the future growth really well. So like I mean, there is 2022 -- and okay, there's no reason not if it's a -- I would not say there's a lack of tool like last year, so like also in the auto industry just stopped like I mean, it was a in the normal times. And there's no reason for us not to grow.\nBernie Blegen: And I think to just follow on to the previous question. When we look at automotive, we actually have system-level design wins in ADAS, regenerative braking systems and in external lighting. And all of these solutions have much higher dollar content for us, $60 to $100 per vehicle. So I think this is a very exciting example of how the solution strategy could play out in different end markets for us as well.\nWei Mok: Got it. Great. Thanks for that. As for my second question, it's regards to the console. You guys highlighted consumer being down in 4Q. So is this more of a reflection of normal seasonality, or are you seeing any supply constraints impacting consoles? Thanks.\nMichael Hsing: Well, Q3 -- in Q3 in consumer side, it shouldn't be the highest to us. And I think at our customer side, they have too much inventory in the -- for the cell phones in like I mean that affects us. And then in the cellphones especially that's in China, like I mean when they \u2013 when the US had an embargo on one of our companies, but the other ones, they thought they can gain the market share. Like I mean, actually, they didn't. And so they're stuck with the inventory.\nBernie Blegen: And I think that what we tried to do in our prepared comments is really make that dip more narrowly defined, but it is really the fast charger in the handsets as opposed to anything that is more broad or pervasive in the rest of consumer?\nWei Mok: Okay. Thanks for that.\nMichael Hsing: Yeah, we didn't have much of an exposure in the handsets, and that wasn't my favorite either anyway. So we've got the least products, however in the last years and okay, why not, okay? But now it's okay. We thought it would be a good.\nBernie Blegen: The technology has actually been very well positively received. It's just the imbalance as far as the demand that was expected has trailed those expectations. And so we believe that they have excess inventory and so we're seeing a slowdown for that particular individual category.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Kevin Garrigan of Rosenblatt. Kevin, your line is now open.\nHans Mosesmann: This is Hans for Kevin. Congrats. A couple of questions. Along the lines of inventory, I think AMD, Micron, on the PC side of things, and Texas Instruments on a broader basis, are indicating that customers are changing their behavior a bit in terms of how they take in components in a supply-constrained environment. So rather than just take everything they can get, they're being more selective. Is that something you guys are seeing? And is that unusual if you are seeing that? Thanks.\nMichael Hsing: We are too small, but these \u2013 we're a very small player, much smaller players compare with the Texas Instruments or the other guys. We don't have a luxury of picking market segments. We're only focusing on long terms. Focus or not focus. We don't do short-term business anyway.\nBernie Blegen: Yeah. To answer your question really succinctly, we haven't seen any change in ordering patterns or our delivery schedule and really don't have an opinion on what the broader market or other market participants are experiencing.\nHans Mosesmann: Fair enough. And so just the last question, your visibility in terms of when you can capture or get back to that 180 to 200 days of inventory, has that changed? And what is that time line? Is it the end of next year? Is it 2023? Thanks.\nMichael Hsing: I think the end of the next year would be a good number. Yeah. That's what we \u2013 that's a \u2013 if the market goes \u2013 continue to go this strong, so like I mean hopefully, some we can catch up at the end of the next year.\nHans Mosesmann: And that's \u2013 is that a push-out, or is that a pull-in from last quarter?\nBernie Blegen: I'm sorry?\nMichael Hsing: Again, you said I talked about last quarter, pull-in or push-out. And like I mean, as I said earlier, we have a \u2013 we still have a delinquent season, like I mean \u2013 and we're having more delinquency than a customer push-out let's say it that way.\nHans Mosesmann: Okay.\nBernie Blegen: I think the important thing is that, even with the demands that are placed upon us and Michael is correct that we saw no change in Q3 from what we experienced in Q1 or Q2. We were able to increase inventory in a meaningful way this quarter. So again, I refer back to an earlier answer. We said the balancing act that we're trying to do between satisfy more run rate business at the same time as we're meeting demand for our new products as well as building inventory that gives us more flexibility.\nHans Mosesmann: Great. Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: Okay.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open\nTore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you. I just had a few follow-ups. First of all, Bernie, the gross margin guidance for Q4, that does not include any more litigation impact, right? That's...\nBernie Blegen: That is correct.\nTore Svanberg: Okay. Great. So the other question is, a lot of your competitors are discrete companies, and they're probably allocating their products all over the place right now, which I assume means you're gaining share. Can you just talk a little bit to the stickiness of that? I mean I assume once they go with an integrated solution there, they're not going to go back\nMichael Hsing: That's very true. And when they've tasted a simple, easy solution, it's difficult. And for these high end -- a little bit of high end in the market, that's what we focus on. The customer pay for it, and they deviated from the way they -- their behavior, how they design product. And I think that's a huge benefit to us. And our other customers, the more in the low-end consumer business, we don't care.\nTore Svanberg: Got it. Just one last question. Michael, in the past, you've talked about, especially in servers and automotive, kind of just getting the side dishes. But eventually, you'll get the main course. Should we expect those two segments to see some main course revenue in 2022?\nMichael Hsing: Yes, yes. We are keep eating the crumbs, okay. We eat a lot of crumbs like a whales. Well, not whales. We -- we're small fish trying to eat a lot of crumbs. And now the fish is like, we grow ourselves a little bit, we can eat the real meals, like I mean we -- as you we keep saying, okay, we have the reference design in Intels, and then the real OEMs pick up a onesie and a twosie for these projects and but these are the real beast, like I mean, end up a little bit small. So I think in the next years, we will grow much bigger in so called VR14s and VR13.5. We benefit a lot in -- and other than the point of loans and the E-Fuse and that kind of growth came in, now we really have a core power, have a meaningful revenue coming next years. And now talking about VR14 yet again. And the other thing that worth to mention about and there's about a 48-volt process, as we said earlier. And like I mean by these years, and we forecast about this year and the next year, the cross point had to happen. And like I mean we're waiting -- we were waiting about three, four years ago. And we said that until we end up -- when the powers keep increasing and the heat generation, heat dissipations, they cannot handle anymore, they have to use the 48-volt solutions, and this has happened. And start from AR and next year, we see many data centers adopting 48-volt solutions. And well, we have a benefit of a large lake.\nTore Svanberg: Great. Thank you very much\nMichael Hsing: Okay. Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham:  As there are no further questions, I would like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.\nBernie Blegen: I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call, and we look forward to talking to you again during the fourth quarter conference call, which will likely be in early February. With that, thank you, and have a nice day.\nMichael Hsing: Okay. Goodbye.",

            "name": "Bernie Blegen",
            "content": "Thanks, Jen. MPS achieved record third quarter revenue of $323.5 million, 10.3% higher than revenue in the second quarter of 2021 and 24.7% higher than the comparable quarter in 2020. Looking at our revenue by market, third quarter 2021 industrial revenue of $52.2 million increased 20.5% from the second quarter of 2021, due primarily to increased revenue for industrial meters and power sources. Industrial revenue represented 16.1% of our total third quarter 2021 revenue. Third quarter 2021 communications revenue of $44.7 million was up 19.3% from the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to increased infrastructure demand. Communication sales represented 13.8% of our total third quarter 2021 revenue. In our computing and storage market, third quarter revenue of $98.6 million increased $10.9 million or 12.4% from the second quarter of 2021. The sequential quarterly revenue growth primarily reflected sales gains in storage applications. Computing and storage revenue represented 30.5% of MPS' third quarter 2021 revenue. Third quarter automotive revenue of $54.4 million grew $5.7 million or 11.7% over the second quarter of 2021. This improvement reflects continued gains in applications for infotainment, lighting and ADAS. Automotive revenue was 16.8% of MPS' total third quarter 2021 revenue. In our consumer markets, third quarter 2021 revenue of $73.6 million fell 3.3% from revenue reported in the second quarter of 2021. This decrease in consumer revenue reflected lower handset sales. Consumer revenue represented 22.8% of our third quarter 2021 revenue. Third quarter 2021 GAAP gross margin was 57.6%, which was 160 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2021 and 245 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2020. Non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter of 2021 was 57.8%, 148 basis points higher than the gross margin percentage reported from the second quarter of 2021 and 231 basis points higher than the third quarter from a year ago. Third quarter 2021 gross margin on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis included a $4 million litigation settlement. Excluding this onetime benefit, non-GAAP gross margin would have been 56.6%, essentially flat with the second quarter of 2021 and 110 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2020. Our GAAP operating income was $77.1 million compared to $60.6 million reported in the second quarter of 2021 and $60.0 million reported in the third quarter of 2020. Our third quarter 2021 non-GAAP operating income was $108.4 million compared to $94.9 million reported in the prior quarter and $84.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2020. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $109.2 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with $103.6 million in the second quarter of 2021 and $83.1 million in the third quarter of 2020. Our non-GAAP third quarter 2021 operating expenses were $78.7 million, up from the $70.3 million we spent in the second quarter of 2021 and up from the $59.1 million reported in the third quarter of 2020. The sequential increase in Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses primarily reflected in increased spending in R&D for qualifying parts for production and securing foundry capacity. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the third quarter of 2021, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $922,000 charged cost of goods sold was $31.6 million, compared with $32.1 million recorded in the second quarter of 2021. Switching to the bottom line. Third quarter 2021 GAAP net income was $68.8 million or $1.44 per fully diluted share compared with $55.2 million or $1.16 per share in the second quarter of 2021 and $55.6 million or $1.18 per share in the third quarter of 2020. Q3 non-GAAP net income was $98.6 million or $2.06 per fully diluted share compared with $86.5 million or $1.81 per share in the second quarter of 2021 and $79.4 million or $1.69 per share in the third quarter of 2020. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q3 2021 were 47.9 million. Now, let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $744.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 2021 compared to $672.9 million at the end of the second quarter of 2021. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $117.8 million, compared with Q2 2021 operating cash flow of $96.9 million. Third quarter 2021 capital spending totaled $18.6 million. Accounts receivable ended the third quarter of 2021 at $79.9 million, representing 22 days of sales outstanding which was two days lower than the 24 days reported at the end of the second quarter of 2021 and 11 days lower than the 33 days at the end of the third quarter of 2020. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2021 were $208.1 million, up $30.8 million from the $177.3 million reported at the end of the second quarter of 2021. Inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2021 represented 134 days, which were nine days higher than at the end of the second quarter of 2021. Historically, we have calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of the current quarter revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's revenue provides a better economic match. On this basis, you can see inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2021 represented 135 days, 18 days higher than the 117 days at the end of the second quarter of 2021 and six days higher than the 129 days at the end of the third quarter of 2020. Currently, our inventory levels remain lean. We are working very hard to return inventory to the 180 day to 200 day level necessary to support our future growth. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2021. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $314 million to $326 million. We also expect the following: GAAP gross margin in the range of 56.0% to 56.6%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 56.3% to 56.9%; total stock-based compensation expense of $30.8 million to $32.8 million, including approximately $950,000 that we'd be charged to cost of goods sold. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses should be between $107.8 million and $111.8 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $77.9 million to $79.9 million. Litigation expense is expected to be in the range of $3.5 million to $3.9 million. Interest income is expected to range from $1.0 million to $1.4 million. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.9 million to 48.9 million shares. In conclusion, we are continuing to execute our strategy. I will now open the webinar up for questions. Yeah. And I think if I can just add to Michael's comment there is that as far as the model that we've always pursued, it was to have our fab partners and our assembly house partners absorb much of the capital required in order to build up capacity, and that remains our being as a fabless company. So nothing has changed in our model. We're just adapting it to this rate of growth that we're enjoying right now. Yeah. And I don't think that we've ever specifically broken out what percent of the group's revenue is tied to any one of the categories that we track. But I think we have been clear that in each of the last two years, that the growth in notebooks has outpaced the rest of the sectors, including server and storage. Now having said that, one of the things that we're benefiting from is that diversification of how we're positioned in this group. As Michael indicated, we are a relatively small player when it comes to core power management for servers and we believe that with both the next generation of Intel and AMD processor releases, that we stand to benefit from market share gains. And in the more near-term element, as we called out in Q3, we're actually seeing a nice increase in storage sales, which is usually a precursor to ongoing infrastructure spending within the data centers. So I think that we're having a great difficulty, as anybody, in understanding when work from home or work from work, as it relates to notebooks, begins or ends. But I think that we're well positioned because of our diversification to enjoy continued growth in this category for a number of years. I'll take the first half of that question real quickly. And then Michael will give comments on the second. As far as how we try to manage GAAP and non-GAAP reporting, is really to be a reflection of what is cash. And in this case, we highlighted that there was a settlement, and that was a cash payment that we received. And so that's the thinking behind not adjusting it as a non-GAAP item. Conversely so, if we have something that works to our detriment and it also has cash implications, we wouldn't non-GAAP that out either. So the two areas that we stay pretty closely to, or three, I should say, are only stock comp, gain and loss from a deferred comp plan and if we have any intangible acquisition amortization. Yes. I think we remain very optimistic about our long-term positioning within the communication sector and in particular, infrastructure as it relates to 5G. But I think that right now, we have not hit a constant investment cadence on the part of the carriers in either Europe or North America. So we think that as that starts to gain momentum and gets more predictable, we're very well positioned to participate in that. Sure. So, when you look at Q4, I think that the two primary drivers are going to be computing and continuation of automotive. And then you would normally expect and we expect to see a slight downturn in consumer. So, I think many of the trend lines that we're familiar with are continuing and ongoing, but the amplitude might be a little up or down from what the traditional seasonality has been. Correct, in either Q3 or our outlook for Q4. Just to add, it's a balancing act, as you can appreciate, because for some of the more mature products that we have, they already have developed markets and a fairly predictable growth in the current market. But what we're trying to do is make sure that these new product introductions can be successful, because that is going to be the future growth opportunity for the company. So, we're trying to satisfy sort of the run rate business in this heightened demand, a period of heightened demand, and at the same time, have very successful new product launches with new customers. Yes. Chromebooks are unique, because while they're considered a -- we tend to go after high-value notebooks, and Chromebooks are known to be lower priced. But they depend on the access to the cloud and good processing power. So the power management, our power management solution is very key. It's a high value for the Chromebooks. And if I can just remind you, Will that we talked about this -- touched on it last quarter. And we indicated that what we're trying to do is source different technologies through either IP acquisitions or talent acquisitions that are complementary to our business. And that will accelerate our ability to be a solutions provider for our customers in the next seven, eight years. And I think to just follow on to the previous question. When we look at automotive, we actually have system-level design wins in ADAS, regenerative braking systems and in external lighting. And all of these solutions have much higher dollar content for us, $60 to $100 per vehicle. So I think this is a very exciting example of how the solution strategy could play out in different end markets for us as well. And I think that what we tried to do in our prepared comments is really make that dip more narrowly defined, but it is really the fast charger in the handsets as opposed to anything that is more broad or pervasive in the rest of consumer? The technology has actually been very well positively received. It's just the imbalance as far as the demand that was expected has trailed those expectations.

With that, thank you, and have a nice day."

            "name": "Michael Hsing",
            "content": "Hi, Tore. Yes, I think, It is on the charger side. And we do these fast chargings, and we picked up some revenues in the last few years in those cellphone companies. And they thought that they can have a more adoption in the market. So they have some inventories, but it's an unusual way of charging of phones and that came in still not very popular. All right. Let me answer the first part first. It is -- the expansion is still on track, okay. And the fab issues, we don't have -- we have less fab issues. And we came -- we are on the way to expand our capacity in sometimes in the middle or -- middle of the next year to over $2 billion -- supporting $2 billion of sales. But at the same times, we do have to buy more equipment for testing, for qualifications and also, we need to hire more people. And as you know, to qualify each part it takes time. And the revenues there, opportunities there, it's just a matter of time. And so the second part is buying more equipment. On the other hand, as an investor, our shareholders, investors are very critical about our -- criticized in the past our spending, okay? I mean, we are out of -- we are slightly out of our model now, okay, and I -- we spend money on -- what I mean, a lot more careful, okay? But the opportunity is there, but we do more sensibly. Okay. For the notebook side, obviously, we gained some market shares in the high-end notebook in this -- after the pandemic, okay, or it was still the tail end of the pandemic. And we increased quite a bit of our market share. And -- but the story there is not -- it's not just we're gaining, that's all we can get. We -- as we increased our new generation with our technologies that's in place, and we will further reduce the cost, and we will address the high-end of our consumer side. And allow me if I address the -- answered your questions, Matthew. And on the server side, we are still a very, very small players. There's a lot more room for MPS to gain. Let me go back to the notebook side that I can -- I think that part of the question, I didn't answer. And again, we're still facing shortages and still a lot of demand in the notebook side. And we don't see the -- we see revenues from -- in the middle of the next year even. Okay. The second part is how it affected our gross margins on the current supply shortages. I think, as I said, all these new -- well, let me say this, yes, we do see the cost increase in, fortunately, in all the product that we released have gained market shares as all these greenfield products. We started to gain momentum a couple of years ago. And these all have higher margins. And our customers give us a very long-term forecast commitment, and we honor those. We can absorb some in -- some of the cost and -- because the way these products have a much higher margins. And -- so during this time, we value the customer relationship and we don't gouge price. Well, Ross, you know then that we're transitioning from a these Wi-Fi routers and those to more in real infrastructures like I mean in data centers or these communication between the data centers and the switchers and even towers. So the last years, our customers are pulling a lot of revenues. And this time, then we see all the other things are going like 5Gs and including the commercial Wi-Fi systems and then and \u2013 where we play a critical role on these in these areas. And we see the expansions, and we will see a further \u2013 continue to expand in the next few quarters. Well, Ross, you see the \u2013 this market is an exceptionally strong market, I mean. And like I mean, a lot of demand is everywhere, so like I mean, also are constrained by the supply. And we do have a delinquencies. And I mean, but that's we're facing delinquency for many quarters, like I mean \u2013 and for \u2013 I think we still have the \u2013 my opinion is that we still have some kind of seasonality in fourth quarters because all these holidays, all these and it will kind of affect us. And so we see the \u2013 as I said earlier, we see the demand is still very strong. So like I mean we're just cautious, and we are on our guidance. Yes, let me clarify the shortages, okay. All these \u2013 what I mean with shortage is that we have a few thousand products and always have some mixed issues. And as we don't have a serious \u2013 we don't have fab capacity issues. And \u2013 but all these are mixed in the \u2013 for particular product that we may have \u2013 we have a few products that have a \u2013 are facing shortages now. So \u2013 and as we transfer to a different fab, it just takes time to qualify this. Yes. We are designing all -- in all Tier 1s now. And we are so small still like I mean in these big growing market segments. As you know, we don't have anything in 4G, and we expect that we'll be a significant players in there. Okay. Yes. There's not so much that affected it. Maybe some products, not I mean -- because we control a lot of our -- the new product, we control our own package technologies. And so we always qualify in a different locations. And so we came in that -- the Southeast Asia problems, okay, we can go through it. We didn't have that much of issues. Yes. Yes, to answer your question, as today, absolutely. And we have a lot more we can chew off now. And as the shortages go on or the new product adoptions in all the greenfield products that we ramp up much, much faster than we expected, and we have a normal out-of-forecast orders and we cannot fulfill. And these ones, our customers understand that. I mean -- and so we -- so now, as of today, we have a blue skies. And -- but doesn't mean -- we're not regulators, so I can't forecast it. Yes, we have. And it's -- if we have a local product, we might as well make them and go design, I mean, everywhere. Yes. As I said earlier, as our technologies bring online in -- become more mature, so that can mean why not just attacking all these other markets that we're not in. Yes. Yes. Okay. The answer is okay. I wish that they come down a little bit, then I mean -- and that they're exactly the same as the last quarter and the quarter before. And -- yes, okay. Yes. I -- our homegrown modules, okay, well, all this strategy, there's MPS involved. There are a lot of technicals in the gate in terms of delivering the end product. Okay, it feels -- there's no end project, it's a mid product, as I feel it well. So our strategies are move up to a food games. And since we put -- we have the knowledge and why win are not captured all the values. And for currently -- current, our module growth, okay, I mean it's much faster than other semiconductors side or selling the chips. But the volume overall is still very small, so like I mean, compare the entire revenues. We tried it different ways in like a launch our websites and like a NPS analyses. And then, they're also using e-commerce, okay? These are doing well. And -- but -- now I'm thinking about it, why we're just applying companies, like I mean, -- and we know that, we need to gain knowledge, gain sales channels, like I mean -- and have those company adopting an MPS technology, we can provide them with better tools, again. And I think the first field attempt in -- are very, very, very encouraging. So like I mean, obviously, I can't talk the detail now. So again, -- and I think that's our strategy. Yeah. I just don't like it. We have so much knowledge to put an end to it. And in the end, we sell a piece of silicon averaging well below $1, okay? We should sell our solutions at much more than $1, so like a $5, $6, $10, those type of things. And those customers will really appreciate it. They don't have to design from scratch. Well, it's a very -- at this time, we see everything is very rosy now. And we -- but on the other hand, in -- we are so small. There's no reason, we would not grow, even the downturns. And as we have looked at the addressable market is that this is like over $6 billion, okay? I mean that's conservatively numbers. That's a conservative numbers. And as we introduce more products in especially in ADAS and the EV proportion size. And, okay, we are developing products. I mean, all of these, and again, we can address the future growth really well. So like I mean, there is 2022 -- and okay, there's no reason not if it's a -- I would not say there's a lack of tool like last year, so like also in the auto industry just stopped like I mean, it was a in the normal times. And there's no reason for us not to grow. Well, Q3 -- in Q3 in consumer side, it shouldn't be the highest to us. And I think at our customer side, they have too much inventory in the -- for the cell phones in like I mean that affects us. And then in the cellphones especially that's in China, like I mean when they \u2013 when the US had an embargo on one of our companies, but the other ones, they thought they can gain the market share. Like I mean, actually, they didn't. And so they're stuck with the inventory. Yeah, we didn't have much of an exposure in the handsets, and that wasn't my favorite either anyway. So we've got the least products, however in the last years and okay, why not, okay? But now it's okay. We thought it would be a good. We are too small, but these \u2013 we're a very small player, much smaller players compare with the Texas Instruments or the other guys. We don't have a luxury of picking market segments. We're only focusing on long terms. Focus or not focus. We don't do short-term business anyway. I think the end of the next year would be a good number. Yeah. That's what we \u2013 that's a \u2013 if the market goes \u2013 continue to go this strong, so like I mean hopefully, some we can catch up at the end of the next year. Again, you said I talked about last quarter, pull-in or push-out. And like I mean, as I said earlier, we have a \u2013 we still have a delinquent season, like I mean \u2013 and we're having more delinquency than a customer push-out let's say it that way. Okay. That's very true. And when they've tasted a simple, easy solution, it's difficult. And for these high end -- a little bit of high end in the market, that's what we focus on. The customer pay for it, and they deviated from the way they -- their behavior, how they design product. And I think that's a huge benefit to us. And our other customers, the more in the low-end consumer business, we don't care. Yes, yes. We are keep eating the crumbs, okay. We eat a lot of crumbs like a whales. Well, not whales. We -- we're small fish trying to eat a lot of crumbs. And now the fish is like, we grow ourselves a little bit, we can eat the real meals, like I mean we -- as you we keep saying, okay, we have the reference design in Intels, and then the real OEMs pick up a onesie and a twosie for these projects and but these are the real beast, like I mean, end up a little bit small. So I think in the next years, we will grow much bigger in so called VR14s and VR13.5. We benefit a lot in -- and other than the point of loans and the E-Fuse and that kind of growth came in, now we really have a core power, have a meaningful revenue coming next years. And now talking about VR14 yet again. And the other thing that worth to mention about and there's about a 48-volt process, as we said earlier. And like I mean by these years, and we forecast about this year and the next year, the cross point had to happen. And like I mean we're waiting -- we were waiting about three, four years ago. And we said that until we end up -- when the powers keep increasing and the heat generation, heat dissipations, they cannot handle anymore, they have to use the 48-volt solutions, and this has happened. And start from AR and next year, we see many data centers adopting 48-volt solutions. And well, we have a benefit of a large lake. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Goodbye."

Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for one year on our Investor Relations page at www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. During this webinar, we will discuss our Q2, 2021 financial results and guidance for Q3, 2021, followed by Q&A session.  \nBernie Blegen: Thanks Jen. MPS achieved record second quarter revenue of $293.3 million, 15.3% higher than the first quarter of 2021 and 57.5% higher than the second quarter of 2020. This broad based year-over-year revenue growth was a result of our diversified growth strategy, technological innovation and investment in production capacity. Turning now to our second quarter 2021 revenue by market, computing and storage revenue of $87.7 million increased 30.0% from the first quarter of 2021. The sequential revenue improvement reflected increased demand and market share gains for servers and data centers and notebooks. Computing and storage revenue represented 29.9% of MPS' second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 34.4% in the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter consumer revenue of $76.1 million increased 14.9% from the first quarter of 2021. The sequential quarterly revenue increase reflected earlier than normal sales of gaming console products.  Consumer revenue represented 25.9% of MPS' second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 25.6% in the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter automotive revenue of $48.7 million increased 8.5% from the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to increase sales of infotainment products. Second quarter 2021 revenue was up 173.9% year-over-year, automotive revenue represented 16.6% of MPS' second quarter 2021 revenue, compared with 9.5% in the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter 2021 Industrial revenue of $43.3 million increased 8.9% from the first quarter of 2021, reflecting increased sales of products for power source applications. Industrial revenue represented 14.8% of our total second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 14.3% in the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter 2021 communications revenue of $37.5 million was up 3.9% from the first quarter of 2021. Most of this sequential revenue increase was due to higher product sales for networking and wireless applications. Communication sales represented 12.8% of our total second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 16.2% in the second quarter of 2020.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg of Stifel.\nToreSvanberg: Yes, thank you, Michael, Bernie, congrats again on another strong and record quarter. I was hoping you could update us on your capacity plans. I know you've done a pretty good job here, the last 18 months, your inventory seem to be in good shape, perhaps a bit at the lower end. But yes, maybe you could help us understand a little bit more what you specifically are doing on the capacity side.\nMichaelHsing: Thanks Tore. Our capacities as always in the past three or four years and we keep expanding. And now we continue that. However, we do have capacities of over $2 billion and before the middle of next year. So we have enough capacity for us to grow. And now we have just qualifier more product and release to productions. And ultimately in our customers' hand.\nBernieBlegen: And at the expense of repeating our self story. You recall that last year, we brought up the 12 inch fab. And this year, we've brought up 8 inch fab which is already contributing to inventory. So in both cases, what we're continuing to do is expand out by qualifying more parts so that we will be able to meet the $2 billion level by the middle of next year.\nToreSvanberg: Very good. Thank you for that. And your cash balance has doubled here over the last couple of years. And it's now at $670 million. Obviously, it's a luxury issue to have. But what do you intend to do with that cash? Because obviously, you don't need that much. So do you plan to return that more back to shareholders? Are you potentially looking at M&A? And the reason I'm asking this is because it's so high now, right? I mean, I know historically, you've grown your business organically, but it's so high now that I just have to ask the question what you intend to do with it?\nMichaelHsing: That's a good question. As a company, I keep saying we transforming the company from a semiconductor to more solution providers and so we can utilize our cash much better than we can in the past and the strategy is  okay, we will buy in a tuck-in technology companies which comparable to MPS revenues, MPS as a general market coverage. So on the other hand we are also consistently raising dividends. And that's our strategy but we're not excluding buyback shares.\nOperator: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham.\nQuinnBolton: You guys hope you can hear me but let me echo my congratulations on the strong revenue and the very nice, gross and operating margins. Bernie, I guess you teased us there at the end of your script, saying that you've got the capacity now to support acceleration in revenue growth. If I look at revenue last year, you did about 35% growth looks like this year; you might do better than that. I'm just trying to interpret when you talk about acceleration in revenue growth, what should we read into that?\nBernieBlegen: Yes, I think that you're familiar with our model, which is to outperform the industry by 10 to 15 percentage points. And, obviously, that's a model, that's a guideline. And there are certain periods where we have the right factors both strategically as well as from a market perspective, that allowed us to do better, and sometimes not as well as that model. So for example, if you look at last year's results, you could argue that at 34.5% growth, that we exceeded the market, which was right about 5% to 8%, depending on what you're looking at, by somewhere in the neighborhood of, 15-17 percentage points. And so we look at that is, well above our model, in the current year, obviously, we only guide to Q3. But it's not unrealistic to expect that within the range of possibilities that we could match that performance, or in fact do just a little bit better. So what we're trying to observe here is that in this two three year period, we're actually benefiting from a lot of factors that have us exceeding what our normal model is.\nQuinnBolton: Great, thanks for that additional color. Bernie, I also wanted to ask on the compute and storage business up 30% sequentially, I think you mentioned that it was share gains in both servers as well as notebooks. On the notebook side, I thought you already had pretty high share at the high end of the notebook market. So I'm wondering if you could comment, are you starting to see share gains and maybe more mainstream or even low end or Chromebooks on the notebook side. And are there any notable areas of share gains on servers? Thank you.\nMichaelHsing: Yes, so we do have some of the share gain across the board in a notebook market segment, as our technologies advanced in which lower the cost, our die size become much smaller. So the cost, the lower costs allow MPS enters a lower notebook segment.\nBernieBlegen: And then as far as server, we've been fairly consistent in articulating our strategy as far as being able to grow our market position with each succeeding next generation, particularly Intel and AMD products. Not limited to that though, but also on 48 volt GPUs. So it really expresses the point that we're branching up in share gains within the Intel family, but also branching out into these other opportunities.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer.\nRickSchafer: Thank you and I'll add my congratulations. Just kind of keep amazing, everybody, I think I'll ask one more capacity, if that's okay. And it's coming from a spending kind of standpoint. Can you Bernie maybe remind us what the outlook for kind of spending just as a general rule as a percent of revenue, maybe starting next year, once all the new capacity is installed? I mean, I think you're getting so many questions, because everybody sees the kind of growth you guys are putting up. And it's awesome that you have $2 billion in capacity onboard by this time next year. But at this rate, it's only going to in a couple years, right you're going to be bumping your head-on by so. I'm curious because how soon would you have to look to begin ramping incremental capacity again? And what might impact beyond on spending? I'm curious what like, just hypothetically, in two years, three years time, if you're at $2 billion top line, like what would gross margin look like, for instance?\nBernieBlegen: Rick, thank you. Good question. Something that's really important to comment on here is that a lot of companies and a lot of analysts and a lot of investors are focused on capacity as if this is a new aspect of the semiconductor business. In fact, capacity is something that we have been managing for the 10 years that I've been hearing before that. It's an integral component to our growth strategy. And so the way that we've been doing it is sequentially adding new fabs and also assembly houses and testing capacity alongside of that to accommodate to be in front of what is expected revenue growth. So while we have made public comment on the fabs that we've invested in to date, we're still continuing on with ongoing relationships in order to secure more fab capacity for the future in order to accommodate that growth beyond $2 billion.\nMichaelHsing: Yes, as I said earlier, so we keep expanding and we will never stop. But sometimes faster, other ones -- other times it's slower, again, other than the capacities, physical capacity itself, we have to increase a lot of haircuts, and MPS is a very, very lean, and so we will hire -- we are hiring a lot of people. \nRickSchafer: Thanks. Sorry, I was having some trouble on my end. Thanks, Michael. And thanks, Bernie, quick question on auto, if I could, I mean, by my math, it's on track to maybe grow sort of an 80% or better range this year for you guys. I mean, I'm curious how much of that is being either directly or indirectly limited by supply? And if you could give a sense of what growth could be or talk about growth, maybe demand that's pushed and how that ultimately would show up in the model say next year? I don't know if you could maybe quantify or talk about your auto backlog and maybe where it is today.\nMichaelHsing: Maybe Bernie can, this year you said that you mentioned that whether the automotive product is limited by the capacities and the answer is not as much as other segments. Because automotive company, they give us a long lead times. And so we prepare the last year, the last didn't, our customer didn't consume that many of our products, okay and so it all translate to this year. And so we'll be able to ship them now.\nBernieBlegen: One of the aspects of automotive that's getting a lot of attention in the press has to do with the fact of electronic component shortages that are shutting down plants or limiting their ability in order to kit a car and put it assembly and as Michael just said we're actually not capacity constrained there. We are meeting all demand from them. And what's been interesting is one of the reasons that automotive got into this bind is because they were working with a just in time inventory model. And I think that they've learned from that that when the parts the electronic components are available, that they will stock them even though they don't have a complete kit to build the car. Now in our conversations and feedback that we're getting is they're actually only trying to satisfy real demand. But that is the timing of when the build plan, when they'll have the complete kit that they can then build the cars. So it's something that we want to monitor because there's been no change in the ordering pattern or our shipment schedule versus expectations because of the other limitations in automotive.\nMichaelHsing: Yes, I might as well add it, okay, about a year and a year and a half ago our inventory were at all time high. And that was one of the reasons that why we do that because we were a newcomer in automotive industries, okay, even though with this type of a current revenue. We're still in a very, very little on a market -- in a market percentage of a market, and so it's a clear as a newcomer, and you don't want to upset the customers, okay, and you don't have a product. So as all these as a lack of what we do to all these key customers, we have an inventory, even though they don't have a clear forecast. And so now is a really benefited us. And we gain a lot more design win activities. And because our competitor couldn't, cannot ship a product.\nOperator: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist.\nWilliamStein: Thanks for taking my question. I hope you can hear me. With regard to first sort of maintenance question with regard to your capacity and inventory, which you've already explained quite a bit about on this call. Are you supply constrained at this time? Are you able to meet all the demand whether it's upside, or maybe customers stretching and trying to build a bit of inventory? Or are you in fact capacity constrained? And our lead times extended as you're communicating them to customers? And then I have a big question of more sort of strategic question after that.\nMichaelHsing: Yes, let me explain that way. Okay, we have less capacity constraints than compared to like a half year ago also, and however, as a customer's -- when you call, after you qualify all these new fabs, and we have a month or couple months delayed of a qualifying these product. And to qualify in the fab, it's not exactly science, okay, mean you use different supplier or different equipments, okay, mean different materials and all the problem, all these issue comes -- have an effect on how you qualify products in the end. So this time, okay, we just have to release a lot of new product, lot of existing product from different fabs. And so it's kind of a -- to answer your question here is the kind of a constraints, we have a lot more orders, and we couldn't fulfilled, okay mean but just only a couple of months late.\nBernieBlegen: And again, what we're trying to do here is make sure that we're servicing real demand, and not building up inventory, either in the channel or on our customer shelves. So what we've done is we've actually have very transparent relationships with our customers so that we make sure that we're in touch with their business sufficient to be able to make those trade offs.\nWilliamStein: Great, thanks. And then the follow up if I can, or the more strategic question, Michael, you refer to this transition from a semi company to a technology solutions company, and it's something I've written about specifically to transition from semi devices to modules. Any quantification around this and perhaps it relates to the ecommerce strategy as well. Any update in that area would be very helpful. Thank you.\nMichaelHsing: Yes. Thanks for asking for that question, now is overwhelming by the revenue growth and the company but not only from analysts from outside and the company inside company is overwhelming by the revenue growth, that allocations and the product allocations and in a lot of strategic things, okay, as less pronounced, okay but the module you're absolutely right module business is for a solution, as a solution transforming to a module company as we transforming, we're transitioning from semiconductor to a solution company. And the ecommerce, we have a teams and we finally, we have organized like a product line. And I know the activities in the last quarter also are quadruple. And so the revenue is still small, but is in the millions of dollars. Okay. I mean, it's more than a million dollars, okay somewhere $30 million - $40 million.\nWilliamStein: With a module and service?\nMichaelHsing: Yes, with the module and service and is growing, as you recall in about five years ago. Three years ago, it's almost zero. Yes. And four years ago, almost zero, okay, I mean we started that. And so we'll continue to focus on that. And so I truly believe that's our future.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joshua Buchalter of Cowen.\nJoshuaBuchalter: Hey, guys congrats on the results. And thanks for taking my question. Gross margins in both the print and guide were meaningfully higher than your usual 10 to 20 basis point trajectory. Can you elaborate on the key drivers of the leverage there? And I guess speak to the sustainability? Was it driven by mix or something on the cost side getting wafers through your recently ran fabs? Thanks. \nBernieBlegen: Sure. I think that we've discussed in the past that, again, it's our model is that we want to be able to grow gross margin at 10 to 20 basis points sequentially, over the long haul. And we've demonstrated very good consistency in being able to do that. But much like I was describing before, this is an unusual period of growth for the company, both in terms of how fast the revenue is growing. And then obviously, as we described in the narrative, it was that the overheads is not, which would be like direct spending or inventory provisions or anything like that is not growing at the same rate as the revenue growth. And that's where we're getting the near term leverage. As we look out, obviously, we don't want to create an expectation that we're going to be able to grow at the same rate. But by the same token, we have established another floor level for what we expect sustainable gross margin to be.\nJoshuaBuchalter: That's helpful. Thank you. And then also on the model, I guess, you mentioned that consumer in console was a bit accelerated versus your normal seasonality. Can you remind us what you would expect the shape of the console business to look like in the second half? And maybe just give us some clues on revenue growth by segment? Thank you.\nMichaelHsing: Sure. I don't know if we call it normal, okay. I don't -- I can't think of a normal anymore. Okay. Regarding to our console business, yes, we win a lot of designing, wining the next design, okay, I mean I think the business continues, okay, I mean I think you have a better judgment than us what's the seasonality now for console.\nBernieBlegen: I think that Michael makes a very strong point there is that we've had so many puts and takes and different lines of businesses that have been added that the rule of thumb is not as applicable as it might have been back in 2018 or 2019. I would comment on is that we believe that we are optimizing across all of our different end markets. And again, it's really the strength of the model is in the diversification. And whereas a lot of the traditional seasonality would have been tied to consumer for example. Now we have much higher percentage of our business that is tied to computing, automotive and industrial, and they don't necessarily recognize the same level of seasonality. But then to sort of complete the question, I think if you look at the near term growth, obviously, the current year is benefited significantly from automotive and computing storage in particular. And we believe that going forward automotive along with communications should be our longer-term drivers. \nOperator: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel.\nToreSvanberg: Yes, thank you. I just have a few follow up questions. First of all, I have a question on your ASPs, which obviously tied to your revenue growth. So now that you are sort of growing in the 50% range, how much of that is units versus ASPs?\nBernieBlegen: Yes, I would say if you look at last year, and last year is representative what we're doing in 2021, is of the 34.5% growth 25% of that was tied to volume, 10% was tied to price. And I think when Michael talks about the solutions business; you're looking at previously selling an individual piece of silicon for $0.20 to $0.25. And now depending on the module, we can get between $1 to $3. And what we're looking to be able to do is design complete integrated solutions for different end applications, where those will be able to achieve for the total cost for that solution can be somewhere between $60 to $100. So, there's the ASP on the individual component, but it's more importantly, it's having that attach rate with the total solution.\nToreSvanberg: Very good. And talking about systems, how's your motor business doing? I know that's probably the highest ASP products you have. So how's that business going?\nMichaelHsing: It's doing well, but the rest of our company is growing much faster. So it's still small. And you can't break out a percentage yet. But I think that was a -- we will more -- have a -- give a more category of our product rolls. Okay, as we divided into a more finer product line. Yes, we'll give it that number later. Okay.\nToreSvanberg: Sounds good. Michael. And last one, about a year ago, you talked about getting into the medical end market any updates there? I mean, I know it's still probably very, very smallest percentage of revenue, but just trying to understand how fast your traction is in the medical end market.\nMichaelHsing: Yes. We have our product now. And that's a well, we're -- we have a several things that we have ultrasound and the ultrasound, we do generate revenue, we see the revenue now. Okay and the other one is x-ray machines. Okay, x-rays. And we put -- we have -- we are evaluating the first silicones and from our design size is  but we have some issue with the fab. But that's a very minor issue, okay, I mean we will be able to solve that problems. And it is outstanding, thank you for bringing it up this. And the performance is like a 5x, 6x better than existing solutions. So the image is a lot more cleaner now. And we couldn't deliver. And so I think the customers are waiting. And we're very excited.\nBernieBlegen: One other comment to add here is the technology that we're referring to here is related to our high performance or precision analog converters, right.\nMichaelHsing: Data converters, yes, right.\nBernieBlegen: And this has been something that we've been working on for I think about 2.5 and three years now. \nMichaelHsing: Two and a half years.\nBernieBlegen: 2.5 years. And I think what is really exciting is that this is incredible opportunity. And we're very close to being able to declare that it's commercially viable in the market. So it's not just a medical which is the first end market we're going after with this technology. But the other opportunities this opens up for us.\nMichaelHsing: Yes, it's same technologies, similar technologies that we'll be able to use in the telecommunication side.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kevin Garrigan of Rosenblatt.\nKevinGarrigan: Hi, guys, congrats on the quarter. And thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one for me. I was wondering if you could tell us what percentage of your business or percentage of backlog is based on three year newer products. I think last quarter; Bernie and you had said new products introduced in the last three years were about 37% of sales. So just kind of wondering if this was in the same range this quarter?\nBernieBlegen: Yes, the reason that we use that stuff on sort of a one time basis was to really give order of magnitude to just how dynamic this new product introduction is as a component to our growth. So right now, obviously, in such a short one quarter term, it hasn't changed a whole lot up or down. But it's really not something that we want to be reporting on an ongoing basis. \nMichaelHsing: Yes, I think the last time we reported, is that 37%? Yes, I actually went back and look at it and was-- we actually cannibalize ourselves. And I think that's a better way, okay, rather than other big guys eat us alive. And I think that we cannibalize a quite a bit, okay; I think is somewhere as a 10% range. Okay, all these new products, we cannibalize it. And that's why the numbers are so high.\nBernieBlegen: But I would say that when there's cannibalization involved, you can bet that for market share gains against our peer companies that's really the leverageable part of this story.\nOperator: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham.\nQuinnBolton: Hey, guys. Just wanted to follow up on Joshua's question on gross margins. I know in the near term, better overhead absorption is driving the better margins. But if you guys have access to capacity, and most of your competitors getting strained, I'm wondering, is there any room for you to get a little bit more to raise pricing in certain segments to take advantage of that capacity support? Or will you just continue to kind of put your foot on the pedal and try to drive as much revenue through that additional capacity to support rather than trying to do it through pricing?\nMichaelHsing: Well, yes, MPS is still a smaller, is a smallest analog semiconductor business, and at the same times, we want to have a deliver a consistent result. And so now you see the margin even in this period, we don't fluctuate a lot because we don't -- we just pass on our costs to our customers, and we don't randomly just raise because we can now the shortage, we can gouging a price, okay, and that affected our long-term relationship with our customers. And so we just maintain that and maintain our margins. Okay, I think this strategy fits everything, fits for us, yes.\nOperator: As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.\nBernie Blegen: I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this webinar and look forward to talking with you again during our third quarter webinar, which will likely be at the end of October. Thank you and have a nice day.\nMichael Hsing: Have a nice day.",

            "content": "Thanks Jen. MPS achieved record second quarter revenue of $293.3 million, 15.3% higher than the first quarter of 2021 and 57.5% higher than the second quarter of 2020. This broad based year-over-year revenue growth was a result of our diversified growth strategy, technological innovation and investment in production capacity. Turning now to our second quarter 2021 revenue by market, computing and storage revenue of $87.7 million increased 30.0% from the first quarter of 2021. The sequential revenue improvement reflected increased demand and market share gains for servers and data centers and notebooks. Computing and storage revenue represented 29.9% of MPS' second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 34.4% in the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter consumer revenue of $76.1 million increased 14.9% from the first quarter of 2021. The sequential quarterly revenue increase reflected earlier than normal sales of gaming console products.  Consumer revenue represented 25.9% of MPS' second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 25.6% in the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter automotive revenue of $48.7 million increased 8.5% from the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to increase sales of infotainment products. Second quarter 2021 revenue was up 173.9% year-over-year, automotive revenue represented 16.6% of MPS' second quarter 2021 revenue, compared with 9.5% in the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter 2021 Industrial revenue of $43.3 million increased 8.9% from the first quarter of 2021, reflecting increased sales of products for power source applications. Industrial revenue represented 14.8% of our total second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 14.3% in the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter 2021 communications revenue of $37.5 million was up 3.9% from the first quarter of 2021. Most of this sequential revenue increase was due to higher product sales for networking and wireless applications. Communication sales represented 12.8% of our total second quarter 2021 revenue compared with 16.2% in the second quarter of 2020. And at the expense of repeating our self story. You recall that last year, we brought up the 12 inch fab. And this year, we've brought up 8 inch fab which is already contributing to inventory. So in both cases, what we're continuing to do is expand out by qualifying more parts so that we will be able to meet the $2 billion level by the middle of next year. Yes, I think that you're familiar with our model, which is to outperform the industry by 10 to 15 percentage points. And, obviously, that's a model, that's a guideline. And there are certain periods where we have the right factors both strategically as well as from a market perspective, that allowed us to do better, and sometimes not as well as that model. So for example, if you look at last year's results, you could argue that at 34.5% growth, that we exceeded the market, which was right about 5% to 8%, depending on what you're looking at, by somewhere in the neighborhood of, 15-17 percentage points. And so we look at that is, well above our model, in the current year, obviously, we only guide to Q3. But it's not unrealistic to expect that within the range of possibilities that we could match that performance, or in fact do just a little bit better. So what we're trying to observe here is that in this two three year period, we're actually benefiting from a lot of factors that have us exceeding what our normal model is. And then as far as server, we've been fairly consistent in articulating our strategy as far as being able to grow our market position with each succeeding next generation, particularly Intel and AMD products. Not limited to that though, but also on 48 volt GPUs. So it really expresses the point that we're branching up in share gains within the Intel family, but also branching out into these other opportunities. Rick, thank you. Good question. Something that's really important to comment on here is that a lot of companies and a lot of analysts and a lot of investors are focused on capacity as if this is a new aspect of the semiconductor business. In fact, capacity is something that we have been managing for the 10 years that I've been hearing before that. It's an integral component to our growth strategy. And so the way that we've been doing it is sequentially adding new fabs and also assembly houses and testing capacity alongside of that to accommodate to be in front of what is expected revenue growth. So while we have made public comment on the fabs that we've invested in to date, we're still continuing on with ongoing relationships in order to secure more fab capacity for the future in order to accommodate that growth beyond $2 billion. One of the aspects of automotive that's getting a lot of attention in the press has to do with the fact of electronic component shortages that are shutting down plants or limiting their ability in order to kit a car and put it assembly and as Michael just said we're actually not capacity constrained there. We are meeting all demand from them. And what's been interesting is one of the reasons that automotive got into this bind is because they were working with a just in time inventory model. And I think that they've learned from that that when the parts the electronic components are available, that they will stock them even though they don't have a complete kit to build the car. Now in our conversations and feedback that we're getting is they're actually only trying to satisfy real demand. But that is the timing of when the build plan, when they'll have the complete kit that they can then build the cars. So it's something that we want to monitor because there's been no change in the ordering pattern or our shipment schedule versus expectations because of the other limitations in automotive. And again, what we're trying to do here is make sure that we're servicing real demand, and not building up inventory, either in the channel or on our customer shelves. So what we've done is we've actually have very transparent relationships with our customers so that we make sure that we're in touch with their business sufficient to be able to make those trade offs. Sure. I think that we've discussed in the past that, again, it's our model is that we want to be able to grow gross margin at 10 to 20 basis points sequentially, over the long haul. And we've demonstrated very good consistency in being able to do that. But much like I was describing before, this is an unusual period of growth for the company, both in terms of how fast the revenue is growing. And then obviously, as we described in the narrative, it was that the overheads is not, which would be like direct spending or inventory provisions or anything like that is not growing at the same rate as the revenue growth. And that's where we're getting the near term leverage. As we look out, obviously, we don't want to create an expectation that we're going to be able to grow at the same rate. But by the same token, we have established another floor level for what we expect sustainable gross margin to be. I think that Michael makes a very strong point there is that we've had so many puts and takes and different lines of businesses that have been added that the rule of thumb is not as applicable as it might have been back in 2018 or 2019. I would comment on is that we believe that we are optimizing across all of our different end markets. And again, it's really the strength of the model is in the diversification. And whereas a lot of the traditional seasonality would have been tied to consumer for example. Now we have much higher percentage of our business that is tied to computing, automotive and industrial, and they don't necessarily recognize the same level of seasonality. But then to sort of complete the question, I think if you look at the near term growth, obviously, the current year is benefited significantly from automotive and computing storage in particular. And we believe that going forward automotive along with communications should be our longer-term drivers. Yes, I would say if you look at last year, and last year is representative what we're doing in 2021, is of the 34.5% growth 25% of that was tied to volume, 10% was tied to price. And I think when Michael talks about the solutions business; you're looking at previously selling an individual piece of silicon for $0.20 to $0.25. And now depending on the module, we can get between $1 to $3. And what we're looking to be able to do is design complete integrated solutions for different end applications, where those will be able to achieve for the total cost for that solution can be somewhere between $60 to $100. So, there's the ASP on the individual component, but it's more importantly, it's having that attach rate with the total solution. One other comment to add here is the technology that we're referring to here is related to our high performance or precision analog converters, right. And this has been something that we've been working on for I think about 2.5 and three years now. 2.5 years. And I think what is really exciting is that this is incredible opportunity. And we're very close to being able to declare that it's commercially viable in the market. So it's not just a medical which is the first end market we're going after with this technology. But the other opportunities this opens up for us. Yes, the reason that we use that stuff on sort of a one time basis was to really give order of magnitude to just how dynamic this new product introduction is as a component to our growth. So right now, obviously, in such a short one quarter term, it hasn't changed a whole lot up or down. But it's really not something that we want to be reporting on an ongoing basis. But I would say that when there's cannibalization involved, you can bet that for market share gains against our peer companies that's really the leverageable part of this story.

            "content": "Thanks Tore. Our capacities as always in the past three or four years and we keep expanding. And now we continue that. However, we do have capacities of over $2 billion and before the middle of next year. So we have enough capacity for us to grow. And now we have just qualifier more product and release to productions. And ultimately in our customers' hand. That's a good question. As a company, I keep saying we transforming the company from a semiconductor to more solution providers and so we can utilize our cash much better than we can in the past and the strategy is  okay, we will buy in a tuck-in technology companies which comparable to MPS revenues, MPS as a general market coverage. So on the other hand we are also consistently raising dividends. And that's our strategy but we're not excluding buyback shares. Yes, so we do have some of the share gain across the board in a notebook market segment, as our technologies advanced in which lower the cost, our die size become much smaller. So the cost, the lower costs allow MPS enters a lower notebook segment. Yes, as I said earlier, so we keep expanding and we will never stop. But sometimes faster, other ones -- other times it's slower, again, other than the capacities, physical capacity itself, we have to increase a lot of haircuts, and MPS is a very, very lean, and so we will hire -- we are hiring a lot of people. Maybe Bernie can, this year you said that you mentioned that whether the automotive product is limited by the capacities and the answer is not as much as other segments. Because automotive company, they give us a long lead times. And so we prepare the last year, the last didn't, our customer didn't consume that many of our products, okay and so it all translate to this year. And so we'll be able to ship them now. Yes, I might as well add it, okay, about a year and a year and a half ago our inventory were at all time high. And that was one of the reasons that why we do that because we were a newcomer in automotive industries, okay, even though with this type of a current revenue. We're still in a very, very little on a market -- in a market percentage of a market, and so it's a clear as a newcomer, and you don't want to upset the customers, okay, and you don't have a product. So as all these as a lack of what we do to all these key customers, we have an inventory, even though they don't have a clear forecast. And so now is a really benefited us. And we gain a lot more design win activities. And because our competitor couldn't, cannot ship a product. Yes, let me explain that way. Okay, we have less capacity constraints than compared to like a half year ago also, and however, as a customer's -- when you call, after you qualify all these new fabs, and we have a month or couple months delayed of a qualifying these product. And to qualify in the fab, it's not exactly science, okay, mean you use different supplier or different equipments, okay, mean different materials and all the problem, all these issue comes -- have an effect on how you qualify products in the end. So this time, okay, we just have to release a lot of new product, lot of existing product from different fabs. And so it's kind of a -- to answer your question here is the kind of a constraints, we have a lot more orders, and we couldn't fulfilled, okay mean but just only a couple of months late. Yes. Thanks for asking for that question, now is overwhelming by the revenue growth and the company but not only from analysts from outside and the company inside company is overwhelming by the revenue growth, that allocations and the product allocations and in a lot of strategic things, okay, as less pronounced, okay but the module you're absolutely right module business is for a solution, as a solution transforming to a module company as we transforming, we're transitioning from semiconductor to a solution company. And the ecommerce, we have a teams and we finally, we have organized like a product line. And I know the activities in the last quarter also are quadruple. And so the revenue is still small, but is in the millions of dollars. Okay. I mean, it's more than a million dollars, okay somewhere $30 million - $40 million. Yes, with the module and service and is growing, as you recall in about five years ago. Three years ago, it's almost zero. Yes. And four years ago, almost zero, okay, I mean we started that. And so we'll continue to focus on that. And so I truly believe that's our future. Sure. I don't know if we call it normal, okay. I don't -- I can't think of a normal anymore. Okay. Regarding to our console business, yes, we win a lot of designing, wining the next design, okay, I mean I think the business continues, okay, I mean I think you have a better judgment than us what's the seasonality now for console. It's doing well, but the rest of our company is growing much faster. So it's still small. And you can't break out a percentage yet. But I think that was a -- we will more -- have a -- give a more category of our product rolls. Okay, as we divided into a more finer product line. Yes, we'll give it that number later. Okay. Yes. We have our product now. And that's a well, we're -- we have a several things that we have ultrasound and the ultrasound, we do generate revenue, we see the revenue now. Okay and the other one is x-ray machines. Okay, x-rays. And we put -- we have -- we are evaluating the first silicones and from our design size is  but we have some issue with the fab. But that's a very minor issue, okay, I mean we will be able to solve that problems. And it is outstanding, thank you for bringing it up this. And the performance is like a 5x, 6x better than existing solutions. So the image is a lot more cleaner now. And we couldn't deliver. And so I think the customers are waiting. And we're very excited. Data converters, yes, right. Two and a half years. Yes, it's same technologies, similar technologies that we'll be able to use in the telecommunication side. Yes, I think the last time we reported, is that 37%? Yes, I actually went back and look at it and was-- we actually cannibalize ourselves. And I think that's a better way, okay, rather than other big guys eat us alive. And I think that we cannibalize a quite a bit, okay; I think is somewhere as a 10% range. Okay, all these new products, we cannibalize it. And that's why the numbers are so high. Well, yes, MPS is still a smaller, is a smallest analog semiconductor business, and at the same times, we want to have a deliver a consistent result. And so now you see the margin even in this period, we don't fluctuate a lot because we don't -- we just pass on our costs to our customers, and we don't randomly just raise because we can now the shortage, we can gouging a price, okay, and that affected our long-term relationship with our customers. And so we just maintain that and maintain our margins. Okay, I think this strategy fits everything, fits for us, yes. Have a nice day."

Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for one year on our Investor Relations page at www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. In the course of today's conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today.\nBernie Blegen: Thanks Genevieve. MPS posted record first quarter revenue of $254.5 million 53.5% higher than the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year revenue increase represented strength in the overall market and more importantly, broad-based market share gains resulting from customer acceptance of our new product introductions. 37% of our first quarter 2021 revenue resulted from new products introduced in the last three years. New product acceptance on this scale has paved the way for accelerated growth. Looking at our revenue by market, first quarter 2021 revenue from consumer markets of $66.2 million increased $28.8 million or 77.1% from the same period of 2020. The year-over-year revenue increase reflected a broad increase in overall demand. Along with the initial ramp - revenue ramp from our new mobile device charging IC. Consumer revenue represented 26.0% of our Q1 revenue compared with 22.6% contribution in the first quarter of 2020. First quarter 2021 automotive revenue of $44.9 million grew 92.5% over the same period of 2020. This growth primarily reflected continuing sales growth for infotainment, safety and connectivity application products and first time revenue from products introduced in the 2021 model year. Automotive revenue represented 17.6% of MPS\u2019 first quarter 2021 revenue compared with 14.1% in the previous year.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie. . Our first question comes from Joshua Buchalter of Cowen. Joshua, your line is now open.\nJoshua Buchalter: Yes, thanks for taking my question and congrats on another set of solid results. I was hoping you could elaborate on the inventory dynamics. You're one of the few companies that invested proactively ahead of the supply issues across the industry, but you're still not near your 180 to 200-day target. So just wondering how you're thinking about balancing rebuilding the channel versus, taking businesses some of your peers can serve or endorse of your share gains? Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: Well, as we expand, continue to expand our capacities, as we said it earlier - as we said it in last quarters. And I think that - we expected it with a current rate of increase the capacity will be at the end of the year or early next year. So we achieved that type of inventories. So if the demand is not continued to increase this much.\nBernie Blegen: And I think it's notable, Josh, that we did increase both in terms of dollars and days, the amount of inventory we had from Q4 to Q1, which runs counter to the capacity constraints that some peer companies are experiencing.\nJoshua Buchalter: Got it, thank you that makes sense. And any more granularity you can provide in the guidance by end market for next quarter, any of the buckets moving materially more than the others? Thanks and congrats again.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, I would probably look to computing where there was a couple quarter gap in data center that data center should begin to take off again. I think automotive appears to be continuing to grow nicely both in terms of year-over-year performance and sequentially. And also we're seeing that same continuation in consumer.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.\nRoss Seymore: Hi guys, thanks for letting me ask a question. I want to talk about the sustainability of demand. Recently in this earning season, a lot of semi-stocks have sold off on really good numbers. And it clearly looks like the market is worried about double ordering those sorts of peak cyclical activities?\nMichael Hsing: Yes, okay and of course, we concerning a double okay I mean in the past, we said okay, we have a rigorous procedures and okay to prevent that, okay. And we partial - we practicing partial shipments in the last six quarters, and we make sure so like - our customers have a very minimal on hand inventories. And the same times - we're not preventing their line downs okay their production line downs. To go back to your questions what's the demand and okay we believe and a lot of our demand is sustainable. The reason we said that, Bernie said earlier in a script and that for us these are Greenfield market, Greenfield product lines, we started to grow and as Bernie said, 37% of our products, we grow all from new products that we released from last three years. And there is no reason to believe next two years, and next years and not even talking about next six months. I'm talking about next couple years. These products will continue to grow. And at the same times, and with the product that we released in the last two years, that will continue to turn into revenues in the 12 months later. So we believe our growth is sustainable.\nRoss Seymore: Okay, thanks Michael. I guess for my follow-up a little more specific on one of your segments, the communications area has been very, very volatile. I know there is bans on different customers that can ship at different points in times. But can you talk a little bit about what's driving the sequential growth that was up so much in the first quarter, admittedly off of a weaker fourth quarter? And then as this year progresses, how do you see that market specifically more at the 5G side of things rather than the networking and gateway sides?\nMichael Hsing: We see as a matter of fact, I see have talk to - we have a committee casing meetings with the top tiers and a non-Chinese 5G makers okay and that market segment. So we're picking up and we\u2019ll believe, okay they believe this year and in the next year, they're on the delinquency to.\nBernie Blegen: We believe we're very well positioned just as Michael said there, because the reach of new customers that we're addressing the 5G solutions is very broad. So, we think that as the market gains momentum, we're very well positioned to take full advantage of it.\nRoss Seymore: Great thanks, guys and congrats again.\nMichael Hsing: Thank you.\nBernie Blegen: Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.\nTore Svanberg: Yes, thank you, Michael and Bernie, congrats again on a very strong quarter. First question, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your share gains especially during times when capacities really tight. So your solutions tend to be more integrated especially versus discrete and a lot of those discretes are in shortage. So I'm just wondering if you are seeing and acceleration in your share gains during this very tight semiconductor environment?\nMichael Hsing: Well, if examples and I can give you a couple of example - couple of scenarios and okay, if we were in a - it\u2019s a dual sources and our competitors using - our customers using dual source or triple source. And I was tend to be in a lot more a fewer components, then our competitor. And that is a one interpretation why the demands and we\u2019re gaining so much demand. And another scenario is for the futures, and we gain a lot of market shares, because just recently, because - for those new - there are new project the shippings, they were putting up production for next six to 12 months. And we have a lot of design win lately.\nTore Svanberg: Great and as my follow-up, and you talked about the contribution from the new products, I know you're not going to give us specific information on pricing. But is it fair to say that the ASP is now of those new products are considerably higher than perhaps the last year or two?\nMichael Hsing: Yes for the gross margins we stay on course and we are not looking for a price hiking, price hikes okay I mean and that's probably is not sustainable? So like I think probably protects our models and again and going the same train as before, okay and Bernie.\nBernie Blegen: Yes, and just to add to that yes, certainly the new products that we're introducing, and particularly those that are more heavily integrated. The mix of business does favor higher ASP for those new products.\nTore Svanberg: Yes, that's what I thought. Okay thank you congrats again.\nMichael Hsing: Thank you.\nBernie Blegen: Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open.\nWilliam Stein: Great, thanks for taking my questions. Bernie, you think it was you in the opening remarks? You said something about paved the way for accelerated growth? We all know Monolithic done pretty amazing job with regard to growth relative to the industry. But should we interpret that as meaning perhaps we stay above 20% for a more protracted period of time?\nMichael Hsing: I think that's all we see announced. And what we see announced and that could be in a year or two years ago. So that can only grow like 8% again mean the last year 30 somethings and that, and this year so far sort of we're in a very high percentage. And so we're look this kind of way it will continue.\nBernie Blegen: Yes, I think that's the message that we've tried to say in the formal comments. And Michael added to that, if you look at the reason for our growth, both last year and this year, it has much more to do with market share gains and new products and having developed our supply chain than it does necessarily rely upon just the broader market. And so, certainly in 2019, we had high expectations, and we were - we're not immune to downturns in the market. But I think that if we have a more normalized demand, that we can perpetuate this accelerated rate of revenue growth, perhaps in excess of the 20% mark.\nWilliam Stein: And then along these lines, I think a couple of other questions might have even alluded to it with regard to higher ASP, I think of a big driver of that is your transition to selling more of these modules those types of more complex integrated solutions? Is that the case and I'm hoping you might quantify that for us I think in the past you've talked about growth rates at least to offline of the module business maybe you can talk about whether this is reaching a size where it makes sense to disclose revenue from that piece?\nMichael Hsing: Yes, the module business is doing really well and like I mean and a modules/e-commerce business is doing really well. And I think we're beginning to find a way how to grow that. That business by no mean this is a - full blown business yet again, we haven't really break it out. And but that business announced and okay, IC it in - it's much higher ASP. And that will start to grow like a two years out will be a significant difference - and a significant contribution to the revenue growth.\nBernie Blegen: One other aspect to add Will is, that if you look at certain of our end markets, and I'll pick automotive as an example, much more of what they're demanding is not for a specific IC, they want to have a system solution. So if you look for example, autonomous driving or ADAS there has to be built in failsafe redundancy. You have to have system communications throughout and the example I'm using here, that coordinate that the cameras, the sensors and the processor. And so you're buying, you're creating entire chipsets for a dynamic solution. And just by the natural consequence of how you're designing those solutions that have significantly higher ASPs.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, and to elaborate on that, and that these are not restricted to only a semiconductor that we design and we offer an entire solutions. And we design like and MPS don't produce anything, but MPS okay, including semiconductor, we design a semiconductor at the same time, we design other components. And we'll - now as Bernie said earlier, even in the automotive business, we're selling solutions, rather than in the past, we\u2019re selling a single piece of silicon in a two or three years later. I don't know - how can you specify as MPS is a semiconductor company, but we're a solution providers. And then we sell solutions, much higher, higher ASP.\nWilliam Stein: Yes that's great. Thanks, guys.\nMichael Hsing: Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from David Williams of Loop Capital. David, your line is now open.\nDavid Williams: Thank you, and congrats on the quarter.\nMichael Hsing: Thanks, David.\nDavid Williams: I wanted to touch on the capacity expansion and you had mentioned this earlier. But how is that progressing? And I guess, is it moving at the same pace as you would have expected just kind of given some of the tightness that we're seeing within the industry - or maybe is that moving - at your the pace you expected and maybe the pricing of that anything surprising there?\nMichael Hsing: Yes, capacity expansions - we mentioned about six quarters ago. So again I mean we steadily an increase in the last years and we did some extra work okay, to increase the capacity okay and from now on probably pretty continuous - kind of increase okay. And so Bernie, you can comment on that okay.\nBernie Blegen: Yes, I think that we've been clear that in 2020, we brought up the 12-inch fab. And now we're continuing to qualify parts on that. In 2021, we're midstream and bringing up an 8-inch capacity. We're continuing to qualify parts. One of the underreported stories here is that we have existing relationships with our fab partners that date back as long as 15 to 20 years. And they're excellent relationships. And we have been able to manage both in terms of when there's under capacity and over capacity, where we have very even handed relationships. So even within our existing foundation or base, that they've been encouraged and been very positive contributors to helping us add capacity as well. So I think the important point here, as we said in our earlier comments, is that continuous investment has always been a part of MPS. It's a differentiator and that we see it as being able to expand over the next several years in order to keep up with the increased demand that we're anticipate.\nDavid Williams: Great, and then maybe just on the leverage, do you think that's remaining in the model here? Obviously, there's quite a bit that's embedded but how - we're thinking that gross margin at the brand and maybe even the operating margin. Where do you think those could go to as you really start to hit on all cylinders and get the revenue acceleration that you've mentioned?\nMichael Hsing: Well as revenue acceleration, we need to continue to invest. And obviously, as we can't grow out of thin air so many times, okay. And as long - as the growth rate there, can we see the growth rate in the next four years in the next four months. And once we see that we will invest.\nDavid Williams: Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.\nRick Schafer: Thanks. Hey guys, I'll add my congratulations as well. Maybe a couple questions by end market I guess the first one is automotive. I think you guys outgrew SAR by 35%, 40% last year. And I know tight component supplies, kind of curved first quarter auto production didn't seem to hurt you guys too much. I know your auto business I think was up almost 100%? So I guess my question is, do you see that as a as an ongoing risk or something, that could impact your auto growth I'm curious. You almost doubled it this past quarter I mean, could it have been better if it weren't for components, supply constraints out there, whether they're direct or indirect or I guess any signs things - are things getting better yet in that auto food chain?\nMichael Hsing: Yes, whether as our growth is restricted by the shortage of a component from our customer size, okay we don't really know okay. I mean but on the other hand, we have total market share is addressable market where MPS is so small, so teeny tiny. And so, we will notice it, and all these Greenfield product growth okay I mean and these are new demand. And right off the bat okay and these products is just taking off.\nRick Schafer: Okay thanks sorry Bernie.\nBernie Blegen: I'm sorry, just to add one more quick comment we have seen nothing at this point, to indicate that there's necessarily been a slowdown in ordering and automotive. So again as Michael said, we can't make a guess as far as you know, whether there is a limit on demand. But we see continued strong numbers of our backlog.\nRick Schafer: Great, thanks. And maybe just a follow-up on hyperscale as you highlighted, Bernie. I think you've mentioned hyperscale spend kind of picking up or data center starting to show signs of life. So I'm curious, just with the launch of Ice Lake and things are - we are picking that up hearing that elsewhere as well, but hyperscale is getting better. How do you see I guess QSMOD data center? How do you see that ramping this year? I mean, is it relatively linear from here? Are we going to see a second half inflection of some kind? Is that kind of build some inertia? And I'm also curious, I think last quarter, you talked about 48-volt a little bit. I don't know, is it - is it still much too small to kind of break out or talk about, or can you give a sense of what kind of contribution 48-volt QSMODs is now? Thanks.\nBernie Blegen: Sure. So let me start with the 48-volt question. I believe that there is significant growth opportunity for us in 48-volt. I think we're very well positioned as far as both GPUs and down the road in the eventual.\nMichael Hsing: AI.\nBernie Blegen: Yes AI applications and there are even automotive applications that were positioned there.\nMichael Hsing: And that these are - it\u2019s not in the six months, probably nine months will the revenue will be significantly up.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. So then turning to your other point, the point of inflection for QSMOD, and remember, just for everybody else's benefit that's our dynamic power management for the CPU processor. That really, we see good growth in what we refer to as VR 13.5. But it's when it goes to seven nanometer VR 14, which is expected for next year that, that's where we might get much more of an uplift market share gains.\nRick Schafer: Got it thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.\nQuinn Bolton: Thanks, I will offer for my congratulations. Michael and Bernie, I guess my first question is I think you've sort of said 2020 and 2021 would be investment years, which would somewhat constrain your operating margin. Here in the near-term, it looks like your revenues is coming stronger than expected? And so even with that investment, your up margin is expanding, and if I'm doing my math right, it looks like up margin will be over 31% in June. How should we think about your level of investment as revenue continues to come in better than expected? Will you continue to invest or do you think you'll drive further operating leverage going forward?\nMichael Hsing: I think up to - from now we see the growth opportunity is, even higher than the last - than the three years ago. And so we will continue to invest and okay, as long as we see that okay as long as we can keep up that kind of growth rate. And if not - we\u2019ll definitely slow it down okay and until we regroup okay. So far - we see too much opportunities.\nBernie Blegen: I guess that's a good problem.\nMichael Hsing: Yes.\nBernie Blegen: Yes Quinn, I do think that there are further opportunities for operating margin expansion. But I think that we've tried to be clear on this Quinn. In particular the last 18 months, that we see that there's more value to our shareholders in being able to accelerate the rate of revenue growth. And that's really where we've been putting most of our emphasis on.\nQuinn Bolton: Got it? And the second question is, I think you touched on some of this with your disclosure, that new products were 37% of sales, but obviously, is the investment community worries about how much double ordering may be going on, given the overall industry tightness? I guess I'm wondering, do you guys have a figure you can give us for the percentage of your products that are either sole sourced, and/or new products? Because I think where, you know, the threat of double ordering maybe would be on older products that are dual source? And so I guess I'm trying to figure out, what percent of your revenue today might be from older products, that that could have alternative sources?\nMichael Hsing: Yes, let me put it that way okay. We have 37% of our products, okay, we have a 4,000, 5,000 products. So think about it and again, and these are 37% and okay of our product in January all these revenue as a portion of our revenue still relatively small. And still in the ramping stage and those products - they are mostly a single source. And as you say that these are legacy products and okay, once the production volume ramps somewhere into the stabilizer and that they will have a second source. And of course, we clearly, we experienced some urgency for - even double ordering okay. And as we said we try to keep them very, very minimal, and okay I mean and just prevent them from lying down at the same times and prevent - we prevent them to have - to carry too much of inventory. I don't know if I answer your questions maybe Bernie you can.\nQuinn Bolton: Yes that's helpful. I guess my last quick one for you. Bernie, do you expect to increase your absolute inventory dollars on hand in the June quarter?\nBernie Blegen: Yes, currently, that's what we're modeling yes. Now again, Michael is careful to add that, this is the supply chain, we have pretty good visibility on the demand. We have to continually try to test and make sure we understand that. So on the supply chain we are looking at continuing to increase the dollar value of inventory sequentially in quarters. And demand, we just have to continue to reassess. But as Michael also said, our time horizon has more to do on the demand front, over the next 15 to 18 months as opposed to anything that we're concerned about in the next quarter or two.\nQuinn Bolton: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kevin Garrigan of Rosenblatt. Kevin, your line is now open.\nKevin Garrigan: Hi guys, let me echo my congratulations on the quarter. Just a quick one from me, you alluded a little to it before, I was just kind of wondering how your MPS now service and e-commerce business did this quarter. And how that compares to last quarter, which I believe also had some pretty strong growth, and just kind of looking a little further out, as things start to open back up, do you think that business will take a pause?\nMichael Hsing: I don't think it's a business taking a pause, and we just started - that would be very upsetting us, is simply just taking pause okay. And if we\u2019re taking a pause okay I mean we probably won't. At this time, we're still learning and may take a pause okay I mean and that's something we haven't really figured okay I mean. But so far as in the last - four, five quarters okay I mean, and the measurements that were in place, and that we\u2019re putting place and okay they are keep going up and orders and the interacting and demand creating the value for the index for demand - creation is to keep increasing. And I think they were turning to our revenues and okay and turning to a much bigger revenues.\nBernie Blegen: Yes Kevin, if I could add to that a little bit is the e-commerce and the MPS now are just two legs or two aspects of the much larger story of how we transition from an IC company to a solutions provider. That also includes providing fully complete reference designs and a broad array of solutions in all of our different end markets. So this is really proving the longer-term model. And while we are still learning and the numbers are still relatively small, we're in the early innings of this. Everything is very encouraging that we're headed in the right direction and on to something that is very sustainable.\nKevin Garrigan: Got it, that's very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nMichael Hsing: Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham:  As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.\nBernie Blegen: Thanks, Genevieve. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for the Q1 2021 earnings webinar. I look forward to talking to you again during our second quarter conference call which will likely be in July. Thank you. Have a nice day.",

            "content": "Thanks Genevieve. MPS posted record first quarter revenue of $254.5 million 53.5% higher than the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year revenue increase represented strength in the overall market and more importantly, broad-based market share gains resulting from customer acceptance of our new product introductions. 37% of our first quarter 2021 revenue resulted from new products introduced in the last three years. New product acceptance on this scale has paved the way for accelerated growth. Looking at our revenue by market, first quarter 2021 revenue from consumer markets of $66.2 million increased $28.8 million or 77.1% from the same period of 2020. The year-over-year revenue increase reflected a broad increase in overall demand. Along with the initial ramp - revenue ramp from our new mobile device charging IC. Consumer revenue represented 26.0% of our Q1 revenue compared with 22.6% contribution in the first quarter of 2020. First quarter 2021 automotive revenue of $44.9 million grew 92.5% over the same period of 2020. This growth primarily reflected continuing sales growth for infotainment, safety and connectivity application products and first time revenue from products introduced in the 2021 model year. Automotive revenue represented 17.6% of MPS' first quarter 2021 revenue compared with 14.1% in the previous year. And I think it's notable, Josh, that we did increase both in terms of dollars and days, the amount of inventory we had from Q4 to Q1, which runs counter to the capacity constraints that some peer companies are experiencing. We believe we're very well positioned just as Michael said there, because the reach of new customers that we're addressing the 5G solutions is very broad. So, we think that as the market gains momentum, we're very well positioned to take full advantage of it. Thank you. Yes, and just to add to that yes, certainly the new products that we're introducing, and particularly those that are more heavily integrated. The mix of business does favor higher ASP for those new products. Thank you. Yes, I think that's the message that we've tried to say in the formal comments. And Michael added to that, if you look at the reason for our growth, both last year and this year, it has much more to do with market share gains and new products and having developed our supply chain than it does necessarily rely upon just the broader market. And so, certainly in 2019, we had high expectations, and we were - we're not immune to downturns in the market. But I think that if we have a more normalized demand, that we can perpetuate this accelerated rate of revenue growth, perhaps in excess of the 20% mark. One other aspect to add Will is, that if you look at certain of our end markets, and I'll pick automotive as an example, much more of what they're demanding is not for a specific IC, they want to have a system solution. So if you look for example, autonomous driving or ADAS there has to be built in failsafe redundancy. You have to have system communications throughout and the example I'm using here, that coordinate that the cameras, the sensors and the processor. And so you're buying, you're creating entire chipsets for a dynamic solution. And just by the natural consequence of how you're designing those solutions that have significantly higher ASPs.

I'm sorry, just to add one more quick comment we have seen nothing at this point, to indicate that there's necessarily been a slowdown in ordering and automotive. So again as Michael said, we can't make a guess as far as you know, whether there is a limit on demand. But we see continued strong numbers of our backlog. Sure. So let me start with the 48-volt question. I believe that there is significant growth opportunity for us in 48-volt.

            "name": "Michael Hsing",
            "content": "Well, as we expand, continue to expand our capacities, as we said it earlier - as we said it in last quarters. And I think that - we expected it with a current rate of increase the capacity will be at the end of the year or early next year. So we achieved that type of inventories. So if the demand is not continued to increase this much. Yes, I would probably look to computing where there was a couple quarter gap in data center that data center should begin to take off again. I think automotive appears to be continuing to grow nicely both in terms of year-over-year performance and sequentially. And also we're seeing that same continuation in consumer. Yes, okay and of course, we concerning a double okay I mean in the past, we said okay, we have a rigorous procedures and okay to prevent that, okay. And we partial - we practicing partial shipments in the last six quarters, and we make sure so like - our customers have a very minimal on hand inventories. And the same times - we're not preventing their line downs okay their production line downs. To go back to your questions what's the demand and okay we believe and a lot of our demand is sustainable. The reason we said that, Bernie said earlier in a script and that for us these are Greenfield market, Greenfield product lines, we started to grow and as Bernie said, 37% of our products, we grow all from new products that we released from last three years. And there is no reason to believe next two years, and next years and not even talking about next six months. I'm talking about next couple years. These products will continue to grow. And at the same times, and with the product that we released in the last two years, that will continue to turn into revenues in the 12 months later. So we believe our growth is sustainable. We see as a matter of fact, I see have talk to - we have a committee casing meetings with the top tiers and a non-Chinese 5G makers okay and that market segment. So we're picking up and we'll believe, okay they believe this year and in the next year, they're on the delinquency to. Thank you. Well, if examples and I can give you a couple of example - couple of scenarios and okay, if we were in a - it's a dual sources and our competitors using - our customers using dual source or triple source. And I was tend to be in a lot more a fewer components, then our competitor. And that is a one interpretation why the demands and we're gaining so much demand. And another scenario is for the futures, and we gain a lot of market shares, because just recently, because - for those new - there are new project the shippings, they were putting up production for next six to 12 months. And we have a lot of design win lately. Yes for the gross margins we stay on course and we are not looking for a price hiking, price hikes okay I mean and that's probably is not sustainable? So like I think probably protects our models and again and going the same train as before, okay and Bernie. Thank you. I think that's all we see announced. And what we see announced and that could be in a year or two years ago. So that can only grow like 8% again mean the last year 30 somethings and that, and this year so far sort of we're in a very high percentage. And so we're look this kind of way it will continue. Yes, the module business is doing really well and like I mean and a modules/e-commerce business is doing really well. And I think we're beginning to find a way how to grow that. That business by no mean this is a - full blown business yet again, we haven't really break it out. And but that business announced and okay, IC it in - it's much higher ASP. And that will start to grow like a two years out will be a significant difference - and a significant contribution to the revenue growth. Yes, and to elaborate on that, and that these are not restricted to only a semiconductor that we design and we offer an entire solutions. And we design like and MPS don't produce anything, but MPS okay, including semiconductor, we design a semiconductor at the same time, we design other components. And we'll - now as Bernie said earlier, even in the automotive business, we're selling solutions, rather than in the past, we're selling a single piece of silicon in a two or three years later. I don't know - how can you specify as MPS is a semiconductor company, but we're a solution providers. And then we sell solutions, much higher, higher ASP. Thank you. Thanks, David. Yes, capacity expansions - we mentioned about six quarters ago. So again I mean we steadily an increase in the last years and we did some extra work okay, to increase the capacity okay and from now on probably pretty continuous - kind of increase okay. And so Bernie, you can comment on that okay. Well as revenue acceleration, we need to continue to invest. And obviously, as we can't grow out of thin air so many times, okay. And as long - as the growth rate there, can we see the growth rate in the next four years in the next four months. And once we see that we will invest. Yes, whether as our growth is restricted by the shortage of a component from our customer size, okay we don't really know okay. I mean but on the other hand, we have total market share is addressable market where MPS is so small, so teeny tiny. And so, we will notice it, and all these Greenfield product growth okay I mean and these are new demand. And right off the bat okay and these products is just taking off. AI. And that these are - it's not in the six months, probably nine months will the revenue will be significantly up. I think up to - from now we see the growth opportunity is, even higher than the last - than the three years ago. And so we will continue to invest and okay, as long as we see that okay as long as we can keep up that kind of growth rate. And if not - we'll definitely slow it down okay and until we regroup okay. So far - we see too much opportunities. Yes. Yes, let me put it that way okay. We have 37% of our products, okay, we have a 4,000, 5,000 products. So think about it and again, and these are 37% and okay of our product in January all these revenue as a portion of our revenue still relatively small.

Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. In the course of today\u2019s conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management\u2019s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q4 2022 earnings release and in our latest 10-K and 10-Q filings that can be found on our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today\u2019s call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our Q4 and full year 2022 earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC and is currently available on our website. I\u2019d also like to remind you that today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.\nBernie Blegen: Thanks, Gen. For the full year, 2022, MPS achieved record revenue of $1.79 billion, growing 48.5% from the prior year. This is despite industry-wide supply chain capacity constraints. This performance represented consistent execution against our strategies and having more Tier 1 customers recognize MPS for advanced technologies, product quality and excellent customer support. Here are a few highlights from 2022. We introduced a new product line of isolated power modules for applications exceeding 1 kilowatt with a fully integrated controller, isolator and power devices. Our initial revenue ramp for this highly integrated and reliable solution is targeted for 2024. These modules are critical building blocks for power management applications for data centers, EVs, plug-in traction inverters, EV chargers, solar power, wind turbines, battery power storage and other industrial applications. Our products are designed to set the industry standard for these critical system-level applications. MPS\u2019 first advanced data converter products for high precision industrial and medical applications were made commercially available during 2022, and we expect to have an initial revenue ramp in 2023. We continue to diversify our global footprint in the expansion of our R&D centers, supply chain partnerships and facilities outside of China to better match our resource distribution with our customers\u2019 geographic demand profile. With our global presence, we believe MPS is in a strong position to support our customers worldwide. Turning to our full year 2022 revenue by market segment compared with 2021. Enterprise Data revenue was up 116.1%, Storage and Computing revenue up 76.8%, Communication revenue up 53.2%, Automotive revenue up 46.8%, Industrial revenue up 18.6% and Consumer revenue up 13.2%, demonstrating broad-based full year 2022 revenue improvement. Full year 2022 Enterprise Data revenue grew $135.1 million over the prior year to $251.4 million. This 116.1% increase is primarily due to higher sales of our power management solutions for cloud-based CPU and GPU server applications. Enterprise Data revenue represented 14.0% of MPS\u2019 total revenue in 2022, compared with 9.6% in 2021. Storage and Computing revenue for 2022 grew $196.7 million over the prior year to $452.6 million. This 76.8% increase primarily resulted from strong sales growth for storage applications and enterprise notebooks. Storage and Computing revenue represented 25.3% of MPS\u2019 total revenue in 2022, compared with 21.2% in 2021. Communications revenue grew $87.4 million to $251.5 million. This 53.2% improvement reflected higher sales of products for both 5G and satellite communications infrastructure applications. Communications revenue represented 14.0% of our 2022 revenue compared with 13.6% in 2021. Automotive revenue grew $95.7 million to $300.0 million in 2022. This 46.8% year-over-year gain primarily represented increased sales of our highly integrated applications supporting automated driver assistance systems, the digital cockpit and connectivity. Automotive revenue represented 16.7% of MPS\u2019 full year 2022 revenue compared with 16.9% in 2021. Industrial revenue grew $34.4 million to $218.2 million in 2022. This 18.6% year-over-year increase primarily reflected higher sales in applications for smart meters and industrial automation. Industrial revenue represented 12.2% of MPS\u2019 full year 2022 revenue compared with 15.3% in 2021. Consumer revenue grew $37.2 million to $319.5 million in 2022. This 13.2% year-over-year increase primarily reflected increased product sales for home appliances and smart TVs. Consumer revenue represented 17.8% of MPS\u2019 full year 2022 revenue compared with 23.4% in 2021. Let\u2019s talk about the general business conditions. During our Q3 2022 earnings call, we highlighted that customers were becoming more concerned with near-term business conditions and order patterns might oscillate in the near future. As a result of this change in ordering patterns, we indicated that our inventory levels would likely catch up to our target of 180 to 200 days and possibly be higher in the near-term. During the quarter, ordering patterns stabilized as customers requested push outs slowed. While this is positive, customers\u2019 orders are still trending below historic norms. In our Q4 2022 inventory is above our target levels. As a result, we remain cautious about near-term business conditions. We also believe MPS can swiftly adapt to market changes as we have done so successfully during similar macroeconomic changes in the past. Switching to Q4. MPS had a record fourth quarter with revenue of $460.0 million, down 7.1% from revenue generated in the third quarter of 2022, but up 36.7% from the comparable quarter of 2021. On a year-over-year basis comparison by market segment, fourth quarter 2022 revenue for automotive grew 72.8%. Enterprise Data revenue increased 69.0%. Storage and computing revenue grew 55.0%. Communications revenue grew 40.1%, and industrial revenue grew 13.3%, while consumer revenue decreased 20.1%. Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP gross margin was 58.2%, down 50 basis points from third quarter 2022 with 60 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. Our GAAP operating income was $136.9 million compared to $151.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2022 and $78.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021. Fourth quarter 2022 non-GAAP gross margin was 58.5%, 50 basis points below the third quarter of 2022, but 60 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. The year-over-year expansion in fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin was largely due to a shift in sales mix favoring high-value greenfield products and operational efficiencies, which more than offset higher product input costs. Our non-GAAP operating income was $174.1 million compared to $193.7 million reported in the prior quarter and $102.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021. Let\u2019s review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $130.9 million in the fourth quarter compared with $139.0 million in the third quarter of 2022, and $115.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2022 operating expenses were $94.8 million, down from the $98.4 million we spent in the third quarter of 2022 and up from the $83.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021. On both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2022 litigation expense was $3.2 million compared with a $2.1 million in Q3 2022 and a $420,000 credit balance in Q4 2021. The fourth quarter 2021 litigation credit reflected in IP settlement and refund of a legal retainer. The differences between GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Fourth quarter 2022 stock compensation expense, including $1.0 million charged to cost of goods sold was $35.3 million compared with $43.0 million recorded in the third quarter of 2022. The quarter-over-quarter change in stock compensation expense reflected a change in the planned vesting assumptions. Switching to the bottom line. Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP net income was $119.1 million or $2.45 per fully diluted share compared with $2.57 per share in the third quarter of 2022 and $1.51 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. Q4 2022 non-GAAP net income was $154.0 million or $3.17 per fully diluted share compared with $3.53 per share in the third quarter of 2022, and $2.12 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q4 2022 were 48.5 million. Now let\u2019s look at the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $739.6 million compared to $738.1 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022. For fourth quarter \u2013 for the fourth quarter of 2022, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $52.2 million compared with Q3 2022 operating cash flow consumed of $18.2 million. Fourth quarter 2022 capital spending totaled $12.8 million. Accounts receivable ended the fourth quarter of 2022 at $182.7 million or 36 days of sales outstanding compared with the $153.4 million or 28 days of sales outstanding reported at the end of the third quarter of 2022, and the $104.8 million or 28 days reported at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 were $447.3 million, up from $397.4 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022. Calculated on a basis consistent with our past practice, and as you can see on the webinar video, days of inventory rose to 212 days at the end of Q4 2022 from the 167 days at the end of the third quarter of 2022. Historically, we\u2019ve calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of current quarter revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter\u2019s revenue provides a better economic match. On this basis, again, you can see days of inventory increased to 214 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 from 188 days at the end of the third quarter of 2022. I would now like to turn to our Q1 2023 outlook. We are forecasting Q1 2023 revenue in the range of $440 million to $460 million. We also expect the following: GAAP gross margin in the range of 57.4% to 58.0%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 57.7% to 58.3%. Total stock-based compensation expense of $40.2 million to $42.2 million, including approximately $1.2 million that would be charged cost of goods sold. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses including litigation expenses between $135.1 million and million $139.1 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be in the range of $96.1 to $98.1 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation expense, but includes litigation expense. Beginning with the Q1 2023 outlook, MPS will no longer separately forecast litigation expenses. Interest income is expected to be in the range from $1.8 million to $2.2 million before foreign exchange gains or losses and charitable contributions. The non-GAAP tax rate for Q1 2023 will be 12.5%. The non-GAAP tax rate remains unchanged from 2022 as there have not been any material changes in tax regulations. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 48.2 to 49.2 million shares. Finally, I\u2019m pleased to announce a 33% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1 per share from $0.75 per share for stockholders of a record as of March 31, 2023. In conclusion, while we remain cautious about near-term business conditions, we believe MPS can swiftly adapt to market changes and take advantage of the current environment to focus on business development and investing in infrastructure necessary to support long-term growth. I\u2019ll now open the webinar up for questions.\nA - Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.\nQuinn Bolton: Hey, guys. Congratulations on the strong results and the nice outlook in this environment. I guess I wanted to start Bernie and Michael, the computing storage business was much stronger than at least I expected in the fourth quarter. You grew revenue quarter-on-quarter when the rest of the PC [ph] market is clearly experiencing softness and inventory correction. So I guess, can you give us sort of your outlook? How do you see that business trending over the next couple of quarters? And then I\u2019ve got a follow up. Thank you.\nBernie Blegen: Sure. I think that there\u2019s been a lot of press recently around weakness in notebooks as far as unit sales. And in addition, we\u2019ve started to see some word [ph] here about declines also in the memory market. Interestingly, memory continued to be very strong for us offsetting a decline in notebooks. And as we look ahead here, we actually see notebooks beginning to improve in the early part of 2023. And probably those gains will offset a decline in memory. So we\u2019re basically looking at this category at least for the first half of the year to be flattish.\nQuinn Bolton: Okay.\nMichael Hsing: The one component the AI portions still remain to be very strong in the near futures. And then we see a very high growth.\nBernie Blegen: Absolutely. In the enterprise data we\u2019ve really got good traction with the GPUs for artificial intelligence and so that should really be one of our growth drivers in the first half of 2023.\nQuinn Bolton: That was going to be my next question, enterprise data was down slightly in the fourth quarter. But it sounds like you see the ramp or just strong results in the first half driven by. It sounds like specifically GPUs, is that right?\nMichael Hsing: Yes, that\u2019s related to artificial intelligence.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. When we look at CPUs in the enterprise data, there\u2019s still initial softness as we\u2019re waiting for the platform launches for both the Sapphire Rapids and Genoa to take off.\nQuinn Bolton: Do you expect that in the second half than the CPU to on a take [ph] in more second half of the year?\nBernie Blegen: Yes.\nQuinn Bolton: Perfect. Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you. And congratulations on another record year. Michael, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the power isolation module business, they expect to ramp in 2024. Is this still based on the company\u2019s BCD technology or are you now starting to venture into some newer technologists? I\u2019m just curious, because you haven\u2019t talked a whole lot about potentially getting into silicon carbide or GaN or anything like that?\nMichael Hsing: Yes, so we do have programs that are going to a wide bandgap materials, okay? And in the past, I think we talk about it in, we have a program to make to investigating and develop those devices since 2017. And now we see the first result and we do have some samples ready, but not in the production yet. My prediction is that are somewhere in the middle of the years, okay, or second half of the years. And related to the \u2013 your questions about the isolated modules, when any higher powers is pressuring inverters, solar and solar inverters and data centers also chargers, onboard chargers and all these in the wind turbines. All of these have one basic component in all these very high power applications, which is all the power devices driven by using the isolated modules. And MPS is using, again, using our own BCD process and as well as our bandgap materials and we combine togethers and making a very simple [indiscernible] and a very ease of use power modules for those type of applications. Some of these products already in production in the EVs currently. And things that we expected higher growth in the next couple years.\nTore Svanberg: That\u2019s very helpful. And as my follow-up, could you just give us an update on the manufacturing footprint both from a capacity perspective, but more importantly about diversification. You talked about, looking at all sorts of regions to partner with some new manufacturing partners, so yes, both capacity, but then also from a geographic \u2013 geographical perspective perhaps an update that? Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. We see as everybody else see in the geopolitical tensions and as you know MPS in the past, we always want to be a local company in every political regions. And we did that successfully in R&D site. And because for one thing is close to customers, other ones and \u2013 other ones we isolated from these tensions from between the countries. And for the manufacturing side, currently, we can fulfill all our customer demand to \u2013 demand for wherever they want to manufacture it. And we want to \u2013 by end of the year or by the next \u2013 by end of the year or next years, we will have fully rent and for the new capacities just in case the [indiscernible] really separated.\nTore Svanberg: Great. Thank you so much, and congrats again.\nMichael Hsing: Thanks, Tore.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Alex Vecchi of William Blair. Alex, your line is now open. Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matt, your line is now open.\nMattRamsay: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. Can you hear me, okay?\nMichael Hsing: Yes.\nMattRamsay: Hey, Michael. Hey, Bernie. The \u2013 one question that I wanted to ask you that we\u2019ve heard, I mean, you guys \u2013 I guess, addressed in your prepared script how you are working to move sort of the operations at manufacturing footprint and other pieces outside of China to in the long term, more sort of align with your TAM and revenue mix for the really, really long term in the company. And you\u2019ve been very clear about those plans. But there\u2019s been some more, I guess, acute reports of maybe some customers that want to very quickly use product sources outside of China. And you\u2019ll probably know some of those reports that I\u2019m talking about. I guess, have those impacted your revenues at all? Are you seeing any strange behaviors from customers that maybe you want to move and source product outside of China more quickly than you\u2019re able to? Or are you already sourcing outside of China to support many of your global customers? Thanks.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, it\u2019s a misconception for MPS is that we are \u2013 lot of manufacturers that\u2019s in China. That\u2019s true. But it\u2019s a misconception. So, okay, we do in a prior COVID \u2013 we do \u2013 most of, we do at least half of it manufacturer and at least we have capacities is outside the countries or outside of China. And to answer your question, whether zero impact in the \u2013 for whoever customers request to manufacture in the outside of China in the past and the futures.\nMattRamsay: All right. Thank you for that, Michael. That\u2019s really clear. Just a question we get a lot. I wanted to talk a little bit about the consumer business, which is kind of the \u2013 maybe the least important strategic segment, but also the most volatile. If you look at where, I guess the numbers came in the fourth quarter. And I guess what I\u2019m wanting to understand a little bit is the philosophy that you guys might have if and when some of those consumer markets and the China market in general recover. Are you excited to keep that segment down around 10% of revenue and will continue to prioritize everything else? Or is that a business that you want to serve Michael as it potentially rebounds? Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, and again, I would say that I mean, in the past, last year capacity issues like a constrain the consumer growth. And we do have a lot of opportunity. We just didn\u2019t pick it up because of the capacity issues. And in the downturns in the past, as you know, that again and will be a lot more aggressive for in these consumer market segment because when you react to a price and you react to the opportunity how fast you react to the opportunity. And within the six months, you\u2019ll see the \u2013 you\u2019ll see the bigger number change in a consumer segment. And that\u2019s what we would do.\nBernie Blegen: And Matt keep in mind, the resilience of our business model has to do with the diversity of the end markets, the customers, the geographies that we serve. So consumer, well, it has dropped to around 10% of the quarter remains a very important part of that strategy and will continue to invest in it.\nMattRamsay: Thank you very much, guys. Appreciate it.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Alex Vecchi of William Blair. Alex, your line is now open.\nMichael Hsing: Hello?\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Gary Mobley of Wells Fargo. Gary, your line is now open.\nGary Mobley: Hey, Michael. Hey, Bernie. [Indiscernible] And thanks for taking my question for the first time as a covering analyst. And related to that, I apologize in advance if I ask an uninformed question here. But the inventory for you guys, that 212 days, that\u2019s internal inventory. I believe, however, your sales, 83% of your sales roughly go through distribution. So maybe you can give us a view in terms of distribution inventory and did it increase and if so, to what extent did it favor revenue?\nBernie Blegen: Gary, opening up, welcome to the party. This is Gary\u2019s first call with us.\nMichael Hsing: And welcome to the inventory question.\nBernie Blegen: Inventory question. I thought we finished this question.\nMichael Hsing: For Gary\u2019s, okay.\nBernie Blegen: Okay. Gary, it\u2019s okay. So when I look at the channel inventories from Q4 to Q1, or I\u2019m sorry, from Q3 to Q4, they basically stabilized. So we didn\u2019t see a significant increase either in terms of dollars or days in the quarter. Likewise when we talk about inventory on our balance sheet, and I\u2019ll address that out as well. There\u2019s about a six month lead time from when we can slow down wafer starts when you see it on the balance sheet. So likewise, as we\u2019re looking now to head to Q1, we see both inventory in terms of dollars on our balance sheet as well as in the channel, stabilizing sell-through in the channel remains very good. And then it should normalize in the second half of the year.\nGary Mobley: I apologize if I step into\u2026\nMichael Hsing: It\u2019s fair to say like I mean, in 2019, we deliberate build 200 days plus inventory because we did see all these opportunity. And then now the inventory goes this highs because go over 200 days again. And that is because the customers demand start to pushing out and this is on the high side and we will cautiously and reduce it. And it\u2019s not \u2013 this is not the same as it was done in 2019.\nGary Mobley: Got it. Thank you for that. And I wanted to ask about contributors to the revenue growth for the fiscal year, for the quarter, 48.5% is quite commendable. I was hoping maybe you can deconstruct that between ASP increases and unit increases and how you see that playing out for fiscal year 2023 as well?\nMichael Hsing: It\u2019s very diverse to growth in \u2013 with a little more aggressive activities in the consumer segment. And this is different from 2020 to 2021. And everything is the same because we are not \u2013 we don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not a one trick ponies, and like not a two trick pony either. So I mean we have a multiple product. We have a product like 5,000, 6,000 different products. We have a few thousands of customers, large customers, let\u2019s say, biggest customer is less than 4% in a different industry. And with our \u2013 that\u2019s the same way as we do in the last 10 full years. And we\u2019re still continue to pass.\nBernie Blegen: Clearly, as you look at a business driver in 2022 and as we look ahead, you can also see the impact of selling higher value technologies and higher ASPs that go along with it. So while many companies use this supply-demand imbalance as an opportunity to raise prices to their customers, we only had one single-digit price increase back in February and all of the other is representative of higher ASPs and volume gains.\nGary Mobley: Helpful. Thank you, guys.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.\nRoss Seymore: Hi guys, can you hear me?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Its fine.\nRoss Seymore: Perfect. Well, first, I also want to welcome Gary to the call and thank him so much for being the one asking the inventory question\u2026\nMichael Hsing: You still remember.\nRoss Seymore: I knew you would. So I had just one question, one follow-up. The question on the near-term first was, you talked a little bit about stabilization in your orders, but said they\u2019re still below normal. So any color on that? And then folding another near-term follow-on is the first quarter, you said it sounded like Storage and Computing would be flat and Enterprise Data would be up a bit. If you\u2019re flat overall, what\u2019s going down sequentially in the first quarter to get you to that? So that\u2019s kind of an aggregate first question.\nBernie Blegen: So when we look at Q1, and obviously, we\u2019ve guided down about 2%, which is sort of consistent with seasonal trends. And it\u2019s \u2013 the industrial is likely to come down. And I may have left you with an incorrect impression because Enterprise Data is likely to go down even though GPU, AI will improve. And then on the plus side, the momentum in automotive continues to be very strong.\nRoss Seymore: In the stabilization color geographically by end market, the order stuff you said?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. We\u2019re seeing better activity. I think that we commented both in Q3 and repeated it here, that customers have gotten a lot more near-term focused and you can point to consumer, you can point China as being areas that was very observable. And right now, we\u2019re seeing a lot better activity but it hasn\u2019t necessarily translated into what I call a normalized ordering cover.\nRoss Seymore: Got it. Thanks for that. And I guess as my longer-term follow-up, a question I get a lot from investors is the really impressive growth you guys did in 2022, up about 50% round numbers. That\u2019s about 30% faster than the SIA defined analog category. And that delta is kind of 2x what you guys historically have done. And some people are concerned that that\u2019s just because of insufficient supply and competition and assume fungibility that you guys are just growing because other people can\u2019t, or some of your competitors had some product issues that they\u2019ll soon rectify. And so those tailwinds could turn into headwinds this year. I know you\u2019re not going to guide for the full year. But are you at all concerned about those two dynamics having kind of overinflated 2022 and turning into headwinds this year?\nMichael Hsing: Okay, tell those customer \u2013 tell those not customers, okay?\nRoss Seymore: Investors.\nMichael Hsing: Our investors, our customers choose to buy our stocks. And hey, we don\u2019t do it in the pay to pay, the me-too products. Everything is pretty much single source product. And our products a lot more programmable, a lot more versatile and gave me and our customer can configure those products. And of course, we\u2019ll take advantage of it, okay, in a shortage. Our customers can use our product in a multiple way, I mean, lot of them are software based. And announced and as you know, in the software side and I mean is a lot more stickier. And we will continue to use our technical strengths and to gain the market share and I mean headwinds, okay, for those people they don\u2019t believe that, okay. We have a hearing I mean that\u2019s fair, but our numbers delivered like our past number to show that.\nRoss Seymore: Thanks, guys.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.\nRick Schafer: Thanks and I\u2019ll add my congratulations, guys. If I could ask my first question, it\u2019s kind of a broad question on your module, just your overall module strategy. I mean, say, it doubles this year to sort of 10% or so of revenues. Bernie, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll correct me if that\u2019s all base there. But sort of what\u2019s the right contribution long-term? I mean, Michael, I mean, eventually, do you want sort of everything to move in that direction toward module, or is it weighted more to specific end markets, maybe a couple of them already. And I\u2019m curious if you can comment on the margin implications as module becomes a bigger contributor. I think in the past you said this a 5x type ASP multiplier. But again, please correct me.\nBernie Blegen: So I\u2019ll give you the numbers correction and Michael will give you this strategic answer. Modules currently are about 5% of our business.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, and it has doubled.\nBernie Blegen: Yes.\nMichael Hsing: In a double the year, year-over-year for the last two years. Three years or two years?\nBernie Blegen: Yes, three.\nMichael Hsing: Three years.\nBernie Blegen: Yes.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. And so it\u2019s a significant business now. I mean and eventually, yes, that\u2019s what all I want to see. And MPS all going to move into a new type of modules I mean in modules, power module has a bad connotation, I know that I mean lot of companies in a power module business and those are 30% gross margins and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the right word to use it, it is a power modules and like in place okay with, but that\u2019s not your old grandpa\u2019s, again, power modules. And again, this is very different. Our margin is above core average. And some of the solutions much, much higher. But \u2013 and we sell it was all well over $100 stuff, and that\u2019s kind of I see as a part of its hardware plus service and customers, the users, they don\u2019t need to know like how does \u2013 how to use the product or how to \u2013 you have to have a very deep knowledge how to design a power supply, okay. And they should use very simple solutions like what we provide. They don\u2019t need the headaches to design a power supply, I think that we\u2019re going to end up with MPS or without MPS will be that, okay, but MPS want to be a leader in that.\nBernie Blegen: And I\u2019d like to go back to Rick\u2019s earlier question, I would say that back in the day, the single biggest ingredient as far as making a decision for design win had to do with the lowest cost. And I think that what our customers are seeing, particularly in the last three years is there are other value drivers consider as far as time to market how much design resource they want to be saved from having to do a total cost of ownership. And those are areas that we\u2019re able to meet our customers\u2019 demand as well, if not better than any other analog or power provider\u2026\nMichael Hsing: Yes, as well to give you examples and okay, we build our own test equipment, semi equipment test equipment and all based on the MPS power modules. And if you buy those kind of power modules, they can selling well over $50. And so that in semi equipment market segments that\u2019s a perfect thought for that. And these are very high ASP and very much, much compact than on the current market.\nRick Schafer: Okay. Thanks for that color. And it actually leads you to my next question. I appreciate all the color that and you guys have certainly discussed with the power isolation module. But just specific to the silicon carbide update, just it does \u2013 it sounds like you\u2019ll be sampling this year. Do we \u2013 should we expect any material contribution from silicon carbide this year? Or are we kind of looking at 2024? And Michael, I mean, we\u2019ve heard different numbers, but what is the addition of silicon carbide modules for traction inverter, et cetera? What does that do to your potential content per vehicle?\nMichael Hsing: Our trashing inverters and using silicon carbide, okay, it\u2019s not this year and maybe even if we will see it next year. Our silicon carbide devices, okay, we design our own \u2013 we develop our own, okay. And we want \u2013 we picked up some market segment that proves our products are reliable in the first. And that\u2019s the first step. To answer your questions, and this year, okay, and there\u2019s no large number of building in our revenue stream, yes, okay, and so we don\u2019t expect that, but that\u2019s just approved the technologies now.\nRick Schafer: Thanks, Michael. Thanks, Bernie.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open.\nWilliam Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Someone beat me to the module question this time. So I\u2019ll focus in a little bit different direction in the past. I know a few quarters ago, you talked about a team that you hired to work in the converter area, which is something you\u2019re not really that known for, but I think this is also another being ASP and a big growth opportunity for Monolithic. Can you talk about your traction in converters so far and what you expect to come in the coming quarters?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. We can \u2013 are glad to ask the questions, okay, a couple of days ago, I saw an image and we received from our customers, and we use our customers, use our imaging for the X-ray machines and much better than their prior versions. And so when is \u2013 we sample other biotech companies and they are \u2013 our product is designed in and we will see the revenues probably a small revenue this year in the next years. This is a slow ramping products that get very high barriers. And the bottom line is we have the technologies, and we have the know-how to design a very high performance data converted. These are \u2013 is comparable if it\u2019s not better. And we will broaden the product portfolios and as we expand our teams and these take lot of efforts and a lot of investment. And so far, we built up a pretty good sizable teams. And now you will have \u2013 see more general product coming up in the next couple of quarters.\nWilliam Stein: Thank you, Michael, appreciate that. Maybe one other, if I can. Something we haven\u2019t heard the company speak a whole lot about lately, and that\u2019s the e-commerce effort. Any update on how your traction is progressing there?\nMichael Hsing: E-commerce. Well, maybe it\u2019s not as fast as I want to be. And I said my expectation too high and I think it\u2019s better here is that we launched MPS now I mean, actually, I\u2019ll take back. I think it\u2019s not as \u2013 it\u2019s true, not I expect more, okay, but there\u2019s a lot of resistance. I mean \u2013 but our modules lot of module ramp-up. It\u2019s from e-commerce. And we \u2013 after last year, yes, after maybe 13 or 14 or 15 months ago, we launched MPS in a remote technical support. And that helped a lot. And especially our module side, again, help our customers can schedule a meeting online. And we can solve their \u2013 when they\u2019re logging we solve their technical issues. That helped a lot. And I think the most part of the ramp-up is from the MPS now from a website. But overall, all things and it will take time, okay? And you are talking about engineer change their behaviors, okay, how do you design the product and how you\u2019re purchasing the product. And I think as next 10, 12 years, even now in the next five to 10 years for the millenniums and to design a power supply and they want to do Google search rather than do the fundamental design like in the past 20 years ago, like the last 20 years. And so these are the products designed for that, okay, for easy plugging play use and easy to use and can buy from the Internet.\nWilliam Stein: Okay, thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Chris Caso of Credit Suisse. Chris, your line is now open.\nChris Caso: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. The question is about where lead times are right now and the degree of product shortages. With your inventory up now, has that helped to bring down lead times and alleviate some of the shortages? And if so, has that taken away perhaps some of the incentive for customers to place orders for a product they didn\u2019t \u2013 they don\u2019t need. What \u2013 it\u2019s obviously one of the things we worry about as we go through the cycle, interested in your view on that.\nMichael Hsing: I\u2019d agree that lead times have been coming down. They were up as long combined as much as 26 weeks or six months. And they\u2019re coming down more slowly than you think. So I don\u2019t know. Obviously, our customers have changed their ordering behavior. And if that could be attributed to the change in lead times or the fact that they have adequate inventory or that they\u2019re uncertain about with the next six months, I can\u2019t really say which is a driver in their decision.\nChris Caso: Got it. Okay. As a follow-up, Michael, you mentioned in some earlier remarks, plans to be a little more aggressive on consumer business as you go through the year. So wondering if you could expand on those comments? Is that something just opportunistic this year, something that you see in the market is that just a function of the diversity of your business model where some other business is slow. So you can go find business elsewhere, if you could give us some more color on that, please.\nMichael Hsing: I think you made a very good comment. It is opportunistic, okay? Remember, we \u2013 how many years ago, we \u2013 years ago, let say and we have more than 50% of our MPS revenues is all from consumer. And these are five fast design cycles in fast revenues and cycles product and on opportunities. And we have the right product, right support and right price and you can move the needle quickly. And obviously, in contrary to the other industrial automotive cloud computing and these are much longer design cycles and they\u2019re kind of slowing down one segment to the other or relative in \u2013 it\u2019s not as \u2013 clearly, it\u2019s not as in the last couple of years. And the consumer is our opportunity again, and we know how to do it, okay? And we have the product and we have the price structures and not as high as all the other segments, and we will do that.\nChris Caso: If I could just follow on that, does that imply when business improves elsewhere, we\u2019ve got a better macro and such some of the product cycles elsewhere with maybe higher margin opportunities develop that you sort of back away from some of that and come back to some of the other segments that have driven growth more recently.\nMichael Hsing: No, it\u2019s not. Okay, consumers is a \u2013 diversity is always our strategies. And last couple of years, we didn\u2019t grow because of capacity constraints, okay? And we sacrifice on the consumer side.\nChris Caso: Got it. Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: Thanks, Chris.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.\nTore Svanberg: Yes, thank you. I just wanted to come back to the data converter business. So you\u2019re obviously getting into the kitchen of 400-pound gorillas here and I think historically, it\u2019s been very difficult to crack into this market. You talked about the high barriers to entry. And other than the product being higher precision, I get that, but is there anything else about your business model that will allow MPS to be successful in this market?\nMichael Hsing: I think it\u2019s \u2013 we don\u2019t know what is the business model. I think it\u2019s \u2013 I know this size takes time. And the market is large, a few competitors. All these, you said these are 800 pounds of gorilla, okay. We are well little highs going around \u2013 and we had to run fast. And it\u2019s just to take opportunities and okay, what presents the product and our customers. And they do have an eye on the different suppliers especially come from the last couple of years. And it\u2019s \u2013 we have a good hope, but we know it take a while.\nTore Svanberg: That\u2019s fair. And just lastly, could you give us an update on the time line for the $3 billion and the $4 billion capacity that you\u2019re working on?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. As we said in next couple of years \u2013 next two years, and we\u2019re still on it. And we work with our suppliers and the gaming I just mentioned the consumer business, okay? And one of the reason is we do have obligations and to fill up these facts. And we\u2019ll be aggressive and getting all these \u2013 getting these orders, fill the capacities. And that\u2019s our gaming in the past. We repeatedly and do this \u2013 have done these kind of things in several cycles already. And this cycle, I don\u2019t see a difference from the last downturns. And \u2013 but \u2013 so for the capacity expansion, we\u2019re still intact in the game. We\u2019re not \u2013 we may slow down a little, so I mean, but we really have obligations with our fabs, okay?\nTore Svanberg: Great. Thank you, again.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.\nQuinn Bolton: Great. Thanks for letting me take a quick or ask a quick follow up. Bernie, I just wanted to ask your sort of thoughts on gross margin. You guided to 58% at the mid-point. It looks like the Street consensus was probably 50 to 100 basis points higher than that through the year. So as you look at 2023, do you think March is sort of the bottom and margins can trend higher into the second half of the year? Or is this push in the ability to be opportunistic in the consumer segment likely to keep margins flattish in this 58% level through 2023.\nBernie Blegen: Yes, I\u2019d probably look at it as being flattish for the remainder of 2023. And when you look at what\u2019s taken the margin down and while you\u2019re right, we\u2019re down 50 basis points. It\u2019s not a significant deflation from the rate that we\u2019ve been at trending at over the last two years. And it\u2019s really because we have the additional manufacturing capacity, lower revenue. And as we look at the next two quarters at least, the sales mix is not as desirable. \nQuinn Bolton: Understood. Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.\nRoss Seymore: Okay, just a quick follow-up on my side on the margin side as well. And this time on the OpEx side, you guys did a good job on the OpEx. I know you\u2019re putting litigation expense up into regular OpEx, which thank you for doing that. But just the trend in OpEx throughout the year last year grew maybe half the rate of what revenues did? How do we think about this year?\nBernie Blegen: I think as Michael is expressed here between diversifying our supply chain and continuing to invest in R&D capabilities that we have some very real opportunities for additional investment that would show up in growing our operating expenses. Having said that, though, there is a fair amount of uncertainty as far as what the revenue outlook is, and we want to be good financial managers as we go through these market conditions. So I would expect that it\u2019s likely that operating expenses won\u2019t grow much more than 50%, 60% of revenue growth in the current year.\nMichael Hsing: Having said that, in the past, in the past two years, now we reached $2 billion companies and they all one point okay, whatever\u2026 \nBernie Blegen: 1.8.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, 1.8, okay. I mean, our infrastructure hasn\u2019t really grown that much. In the last couple of years, and it\u2019s difficult to hire people and now we have a lot more breathing room, okay, this is the time to build up a company.\nRoss Seymore: Great. And I guess for a quick follow-up, I just wanted to revisit one of the questions that was asked, I think it was the very first question or close to the beginning on the storage and computing strength. I know you said notebook was better than you thought and the memory/storage was weaker, and those two kind of go the opposite direction in the first quarter then. But those markets in aggregate have been weak across the board for quite some time. So I\u2019m still a little surprised at the strength in the fourth quarter and the stability in the first. What would you attribute that to? Obviously, you\u2019re getting the orders, but are you guys taking share? Is it the Tier 1 penetration? Is it content? Just any more color on that because it\u2019s such a disconnect to the end market in general?\nMichael Hsing: I think I believe we gained some shares.\nBernie Blegen: Absolutely.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. We gained some market shares.\nRoss Seymore: Great. Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, we\u2019re a little bit aggressive on in summer low end market.\nBernie Blegen: Yes.\nRoss Seymore: Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: [Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.\nBernie Blegen: Great. Thank you very much and for joining us for this conference call, and we\u2019ll be talking again here for the first quarter update, which will likely be in the late April. So thank you very much.",

            "name": "Bernie Blegen",
            "content": "Thanks, Gen. For the full year, 2022, MPS achieved record revenue of $1.79 billion, growing 48.5% from the prior year. This is despite industry-wide supply chain capacity constraints. This performance represented consistent execution against our strategies and having more Tier 1 customers recognize MPS for advanced technologies, product quality and excellent customer support. Here are a few highlights from 2022. We introduced a new product line of isolated power modules for applications exceeding 1 kilowatt with a fully integrated controller, isolator and power devices. Our initial revenue ramp for this highly integrated and reliable solution is targeted for 2024. These modules are critical building blocks for power management applications for data centers, EVs, plug-in traction inverters, EV chargers, solar power, wind turbines, battery power storage and other industrial applications. Our products are designed to set the industry standard for these critical system-level applications. MPS' first advanced data converter products for high precision industrial and medical applications were made commercially available during 2022, and we expect to have an initial revenue ramp in 2023. We continue to diversify our global footprint in the expansion of our R&D centers, supply chain partnerships and facilities outside of China to better match our resource distribution with our customers' geographic demand profile. With our global presence, we believe MPS is in a strong position to support our customers worldwide. Turning to our full year 2022 revenue by market segment compared with 2021. Enterprise Data revenue was up 116.1%, Storage and Computing revenue up 76.8%, Communication revenue up 53.2%, Automotive revenue up 46.8%, Industrial revenue up 18.6% and Consumer revenue up 13.2%, demonstrating broad-based full year 2022 revenue improvement. Full year 2022 Enterprise Data revenue grew $135.1 million over the prior year to $251.4 million. This 116.1% increase is primarily due to higher sales of our power management solutions for cloud-based CPU and GPU server applications. Enterprise Data revenue represented 14.0% of MPS' total revenue in 2022, compared with 9.6% in 2021. Storage and Computing revenue for 2022 grew $196.7 million over the prior year to $452.6 million. This 76.8% increase primarily resulted from strong sales growth for storage applications and enterprise notebooks. Storage and Computing revenue represented 25.3% of MPS' total revenue in 2022, compared with 21.2% in 2021. Communications revenue grew $87.4 million to $251.5 million. This 53.2% improvement reflected higher sales of products for both 5G and satellite communications infrastructure applications. Communications revenue represented 14.0% of our 2022 revenue compared with 13.6% in 2021. Automotive revenue grew $95.7 million to $300.0 million in 2022. This 46.8% year-over-year gain primarily represented increased sales of our highly integrated applications supporting automated driver assistance systems, the digital cockpit and connectivity. Automotive revenue represented 16.7% of MPS' full year 2022 revenue compared with 16.9% in 2021. Industrial revenue grew $34.4 million to $218.2 million in 2022. This 18.6% year-over-year increase primarily reflected higher sales in applications for smart meters and industrial automation. Industrial revenue represented 12.2% of MPS' full year 2022 revenue compared with 15.3% in 2021. Consumer revenue grew $37.2 million to $319.5 million in 2022. This 13.2% year-over-year increase primarily reflected increased product sales for home appliances and smart TVs. Consumer revenue represented 17.8% of MPS' full year 2022 revenue compared with 23.4% in 2021. Let's talk about the general business conditions. During our Q3 2022 earnings call, we highlighted that customers were becoming more concerned with near-term business conditions and order patterns might oscillate in the near future. As a result of this change in ordering patterns, we indicated that our inventory levels would likely catch up to our target of 180 to 200 days and possibly be higher in the near-term. During the quarter, ordering patterns stabilized as customers requested push outs slowed. While this is positive, customers' orders are still trending below historic norms. In our Q4 2022 inventory is above our target levels. As a result, we remain cautious about near-term business conditions. We also believe MPS can swiftly adapt to market changes as we have done so successfully during similar macroeconomic changes in the past. Switching to Q4. MPS had a record fourth quarter with revenue of $460.0 million, down 7.1% from revenue generated in the third quarter of 2022, but up 36.7% from the comparable quarter of 2021. On a year-over-year basis comparison by market segment, fourth quarter 2022 revenue for automotive grew 72.8%. Enterprise Data revenue increased 69.0%. Storage and computing revenue grew 55.0%. Communications revenue grew 40.1%, and industrial revenue grew 13.3%, while consumer revenue decreased 20.1%. Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP gross margin was 58.2%, down 50 basis points from third quarter 2022 with 60 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. Our GAAP operating income was $136.9 million compared to $151.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2022 and $78.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021. Fourth quarter 2022 non-GAAP gross margin was 58.5%, 50 basis points below the third quarter of 2022, but 60 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. The year-over-year expansion in fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin was largely due to a shift in sales mix favoring high-value greenfield products and operational efficiencies, which more than offset higher product input costs. Our non-GAAP operating income was $174.1 million compared to $193.7 million reported in the prior quarter and $102.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $130.9 million in the fourth quarter compared with $139.0 million in the third quarter of 2022, and $115.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2022 operating expenses were $94.8 million, down from the $98.4 million we spent in the third quarter of 2022 and up from the $83.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021. On both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2022 litigation expense was $3.2 million compared with a $2.1 million in Q3 2022 and a $420,000 credit balance in Q4 2021. The fourth quarter 2021 litigation credit reflected in IP settlement and refund of a legal retainer. The differences between GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Fourth quarter 2022 stock compensation expense, including $1.0 million charged to cost of goods sold was $35.3 million compared with $43.0 million recorded in the third quarter of 2022. The quarter-over-quarter change in stock compensation expense reflected a change in the planned vesting assumptions. Switching to the bottom line. Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP net income was $119.1 million or $2.45 per fully diluted share compared with $2.57 per share in the third quarter of 2022 and $1.51 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. Q4 2022 non-GAAP net income was $154.0 million or $3.17 per fully diluted share compared with $3.53 per share in the third quarter of 2022, and $2.12 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q4 2022 were 48.5 million. Now let's look at the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $739.6 million compared to $738.1 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022. For fourth quarter \u2013 for the fourth quarter of 2022, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $52.2 million compared with Q3 2022 operating cash flow consumed of $18.2 million. Fourth quarter 2022 capital spending totaled $12.8 million. Accounts receivable ended the fourth quarter of 2022 at $182.7 million or 36 days of sales outstanding compared with the $153.4 million or 28 days of sales outstanding reported at the end of the third quarter of 2022, and the $104.8 million or 28 days reported at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 were $447.3 million, up from $397.4 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022. Calculated on a basis consistent with our past practice, and as you can see on the webinar video, days of inventory rose to 212 days at the end of Q4 2022 from the 167 days at the end of the third quarter of 2022. Historically, we've calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of current quarter revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's revenue provides a better economic match. On this basis, again, you can see days of inventory increased to 214 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 from 188 days at the end of the third quarter of 2022. I would now like to turn to our Q1 2023 outlook. We are forecasting Q1 2023 revenue in the range of $440 million to $460 million. We also expect the following: GAAP gross margin in the range of 57.4% to 58.0%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 57.7% to 58.3%. Total stock-based compensation expense of $40.2 million to $42.2 million, including approximately $1.2 million that would be charged cost of goods sold. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses including litigation expenses between $135.1 million and million $139.1 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to be in the range of $96.1 to $98.1 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation expense, but includes litigation expense. Beginning with the Q1 2023 outlook, MPS will no longer separately forecast litigation expenses. Interest income is expected to be in the range from $1.8 million to $2.2 million before foreign exchange gains or losses and charitable contributions. The non-GAAP tax rate for Q1 2023 will be 12.5%. The non-GAAP tax rate remains unchanged from 2022 as there have not been any material changes in tax regulations. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 48.2 to 49.2 million shares. Finally, I'm pleased to announce a 33% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1 per share from $0.75 per share for stockholders of a record as of March 31, 2023. In conclusion, while we remain cautious about near-term business conditions, we believe MPS can swiftly adapt to market changes and take advantage of the current environment to focus on business development and investing in infrastructure necessary to support long-term growth. I'll now open the webinar up for questions. Sure. I think that there's been a lot of press recently around weakness in notebooks as far as unit sales. And in addition, we've started to see some word [ph] here about declines also in the memory market. Interestingly, memory continued to be very strong for us offsetting a decline in notebooks. And as we look ahead here, we actually see notebooks beginning to improve in the early part of 2023. And probably those gains will offset a decline in memory. So we're basically looking at this category at least for the first half of the year to be flattish. Absolutely. In the enterprise data we've really got good traction with the GPUs for artificial intelligence and so that should really be one of our growth drivers in the first half of 2023. Yes. When we look at CPUs in the enterprise data, there's still initial softness as we're waiting for the platform launches for both the Sapphire Rapids and Genoa to take off. Yes. And Matt keep in mind, the resilience of our business model has to do with the diversity of the end markets, the customers, the geographies that we serve. So consumer, well, it has dropped to around 10% of the quarter remains a very important part of that strategy and will continue to invest in it. Gary, opening up, welcome to the party. This is Gary's first call with us. Inventory question. I thought we finished this question. Okay. Gary, it's okay. So when I look at the channel inventories from Q4 to Q1, or I'm sorry, from Q3 to Q4, they basically stabilized. So we didn't see a significant increase either in terms of dollars or days in the quarter. Likewise when we talk about inventory on our balance sheet, and I'll address that out as well. There's about a six month lead time from when we can slow down wafer starts when you see it on the balance sheet. So likewise, as we're looking now to head to Q1, we see both inventory in terms of dollars on our balance sheet as well as in the channel, stabilizing sell-through in the channel remains very good. And then it should normalize in the second half of the year. Clearly, as you look at a business driver in 2022 and as we look ahead, you can also see the impact of selling higher value technologies and higher ASPs that go along with it. So while many companies use this supply-demand imbalance as an opportunity to raise prices to their customers, we only had one single-digit price increase back in February and all of the other is representative of higher ASPs and volume gains. So when we look at Q1, and obviously, we've guided down about 2%, which is sort of consistent with seasonal trends. And it's \u2013 the industrial is likely to come down. And I may have left you with an incorrect impression because Enterprise Data is likely to go down even though GPU, AI will improve. And then on the plus side, the momentum in automotive continues to be very strong. So I'll give you the numbers correction and Michael will give you this strategic answer. Modules currently are about 5% of our business. Yes. Yes, three. Yes. And I'd like to go back to Rick's earlier question, I would say that back in the day, the single biggest ingredient as far as making a decision for design win had to do with the lowest cost. And I think that what our customers are seeing, particularly in the last three years is there are other value drivers consider as far as time to market how much design resource they want to be saved from having to do a total cost of ownership. And those are areas that we're able to meet our customers' demand as well, if not better than any other analog or power provider... Yes, I'd probably look at it as being flattish for the remainder of 2023. And when you look at what's taken the margin down and while you're right, we're down 50 basis points. It's not a significant deflation from the rate that we've been at trending at over the last two years. And it's really because we have the additional manufacturing capacity, lower revenue. And as we look at the next two quarters at least, the sales mix is not as desirable. I think as Michael is expressed here between diversifying our supply chain and continuing to invest in R&D capabilities that we have some very real opportunities for additional investment that would show up in growing our operating expenses. Having said that, though, there is a fair amount of uncertainty as far as what the revenue outlook is, and we want to be good financial managers as we go through these market conditions. So I would expect that it's likely that operating expenses won't grow much more than 50%, 60% of revenue growth in the current year. 1.8. Absolutely. Yes. Great. Thank you very much and for joining us for this conference call, and we'll be talking again here for the first quarter update, which will likely be in the late April. So thank you very much."

            "content": "The one component the AI portions still remain to be very strong in the near futures. And then we see a very high growth. Yes, that's related to artificial intelligence. Yes, so we do have programs that are going to a wide bandgap materials, okay? And in the past, I think we talk about it in, we have a program to make to investigating and develop those devices since 2017. And now we see the first result and we do have some samples ready, but not in the production yet. My prediction is that are somewhere in the middle of the years, okay, or second half of the years. And related to the \u2013 your questions about the isolated modules, when any higher powers is pressuring inverters, solar and solar inverters and data centers also chargers, onboard chargers and all these in the wind turbines. All of these have one basic component in all these very high power applications, which is all the power devices driven by using the isolated modules. And MPS is using, again, using our own BCD process and as well as our bandgap materials and we combine togethers and making a very simple [indiscernible] and a very ease of use power modules for those type of applications. Some of these products already in production in the EVs currently. And things that we expected higher growth in the next couple years. Yes. We see as everybody else see in the geopolitical tensions and as you know MPS in the past, we always want to be a local company in every political regions. And we did that successfully in R&D site. And because for one thing is close to customers, other ones and \u2013 other ones we isolated from these tensions from between the countries. And for the manufacturing side, currently, we can fulfill all our customer demand to \u2013 demand for wherever they want to manufacture it. And we want to \u2013 by end of the year or by the next \u2013 by end of the year or next years, we will have fully rent and for the new capacities just in case the [indiscernible] really separated. Thanks, Tore. Yes. Yes, it's a misconception for MPS is that we are \u2013 lot of manufacturers that's in China. That's true. But it's a misconception. So, okay, we do in a prior COVID \u2013 we do \u2013 most of, we do at least half of it manufacturer and at least we have capacities is outside the countries or outside of China. And to answer your question, whether zero impact in the \u2013 for whoever customers request to manufacture in the outside of China in the past and the futures. Yes, and again, I would say that I mean, in the past, last year capacity issues like a constrain the consumer growth. And we do have a lot of opportunity. We just didn't pick it up because of the capacity issues. And in the downturns in the past, as you know, that again and will be a lot more aggressive for in these consumer market segment because when you react to a price and you react to the opportunity how fast you react to the opportunity. And within the six months, you'll see the \u2013 you'll see the bigger number change in a consumer segment. And that's what we would do. Hello? And welcome to the inventory question. For Gary's, okay. It's fair to say like I mean, in 2019, we deliberate build 200 days plus inventory because we did see all these opportunity. And then now the inventory goes this highs because go over 200 days again. And that is because the customers demand start to pushing out and this is on the high side and we will cautiously and reduce it. And it's not \u2013 this is not the same as it was done in 2019. It's very diverse to growth in \u2013 with a little more aggressive activities in the consumer segment. And this is different from 2020 to 2021. And everything is the same because we are not \u2013 we don't \u2013 it's not a one trick ponies, and like not a two trick pony either. So I mean we have a multiple product. We have a product like 5,000, 6,000 different products. We have a few thousands of customers, large customers, let's say, biggest customer is less than 4% in a different industry. And with our \u2013 that's the same way as we do in the last 10 full years. And we're still continue to pass. Yes. Its fine. You still remember. Yes. We're seeing better activity. I think that we commented both in Q3 and repeated it here, that customers have gotten a lot more near-term focused and you can point to consumer, you can point China as being areas that was very observable. And right now, we're seeing a lot better activity but it hasn't necessarily translated into what I call a normalized ordering cover. Okay, tell those customer \u2013 tell those not customers, okay? Our investors, our customers choose to buy our stocks. And hey, we don't do it in the pay to pay, the me-too products. Everything is pretty much single source product. And our products a lot more programmable, a lot more versatile and gave me and our customer can configure those products. And of course, we'll take advantage of it, okay, in a shortage. Our customers can use our product in a multiple way, I mean, lot of them are software based. And announced and as you know, in the software side and I mean is a lot more stickier. And we will continue to use our technical strengths and to gain the market share and I mean headwinds, okay, for those people they don't believe that, okay. We have a hearing I mean that's fair, but our numbers delivered like our past number to show that. Yes, and it has doubled. In a double the year, year-over-year for the last two years. Three years or two years? Three years. Yes. And so it's a significant business now. I mean and eventually, yes, that's what all I want to see. And MPS all going to move into a new type of modules I mean in modules, power module has a bad connotation, I know that I mean lot of companies in a power module business and those are 30% gross margins and I don't know what's the right word to use it, it is a power modules and like in place okay with, but that's not your old grandpa's, again, power modules. And again, this is very different. Our margin is above core average. And some of the solutions much, much higher. But \u2013 and we sell it was all well over $100 stuff, and that's kind of I see as a part of its hardware plus service and customers, the users, they don't need to know like how does \u2013 how to use the product or how to \u2013 you have to have a very deep knowledge how to design a power supply, okay. And they should use very simple solutions like what we provide. They don't need the headaches to design a power supply, I think that we're going to end up with MPS or without MPS will be that, okay, but MPS want to be a leader in that. Yes, as well to give you examples and okay, we build our own test equipment, semi equipment test equipment and all based on the MPS power modules. And if you buy those kind of power modules, they can selling well over $50. And so that in semi equipment market segments that's a perfect thought for that. And these are very high ASP and very much, much compact than on the current market. Our trashing inverters and using silicon carbide, okay, it's not this year and maybe even if we will see it next year. Our silicon carbide devices, okay, we design our own \u2013 we develop our own, okay. And we want \u2013 we picked up some market segment that proves our products are reliable in the first. And that's the first step. To answer your questions, and this year, okay, and there's no large number of building in our revenue stream, yes, okay, and so we don't expect that, but that's just approved the technologies now. Yes. We can \u2013 are glad to ask the questions, okay, a couple of days ago, I saw an image and we received from our customers, and we use our customers, use our imaging for the X-ray machines and much better than their prior versions. And so when is \u2013 we sample other biotech companies and they are \u2013 our product is designed in and we will see the revenues probably a small revenue this year in the next years. This is a slow ramping products that get very high barriers. And the bottom line is we have the technologies, and we have the know-how to design a very high performance data converted. These are \u2013 is comparable if it's not better. And we will broaden the product portfolios and as we expand our teams and these take lot of efforts and a lot of investment. And so far, we built up a pretty good sizable teams. And now you will have \u2013 see more general product coming up in the next couple of quarters. E-commerce. Well, maybe it's not as fast as I want to be. And I said my expectation too high and I think it's better here is that we launched MPS now I mean, actually, I'll take back. I think it's not as \u2013 it's true, not I expect more, okay, but there's a lot of resistance. I mean \u2013 but our modules lot of module ramp-up. It's from e-commerce. And we \u2013 after last year, yes, after maybe 13 or 14 or 15 months ago, we launched MPS in a remote technical support. And that helped a lot. And especially our module side, again, help our customers can schedule a meeting online. And we can solve their \u2013 when they're logging we solve their technical issues. That helped a lot. And I think the most part of the ramp-up is from the MPS now from a website. But overall, all things and it will take time, okay? And you are talking about engineer change their behaviors, okay, how do you design the product and how you're purchasing the product. And I think as next 10, 12 years, even now in the next five to 10 years for the millenniums and to design a power supply and they want to do Google search rather than do the fundamental design like in the past 20 years ago, like the last 20 years. And so these are the products designed for that, okay, for easy plugging play use and easy to use and can buy from the Internet. I'd agree that lead times have been coming down. They were up as long combined as much as 26 weeks or six months. And they're coming down more slowly than you think. So I don't know. Obviously, our customers have changed their ordering behavior. And if that could be attributed to the change in lead times or the fact that they have adequate inventory or that they're uncertain about with the next six months, I can't really say which is a driver in their decision. I think you made a very good comment. It is opportunistic, okay? Remember, we \u2013 how many years ago, we \u2013 years ago, let say and we have more than 50% of our MPS revenues is all from consumer. And these are five fast design cycles in fast revenues and cycles product and on opportunities. And we have the right product, right support and right price and you can move the needle quickly. And obviously, in contrary to the other industrial automotive cloud computing and these are much longer design cycles and they're kind of slowing down one segment to the other or relative in \u2013 it's not as \u2013 clearly, it's not as in the last couple of years. And the consumer is our opportunity again, and we know how to do it, okay? And we have the product and we have the price structures and not as high as all the other segments, and we will do that. No, it's not. Okay, consumers is a \u2013 diversity is always our strategies. And last couple of years, we didn't grow because of capacity constraints, okay? And we sacrifice on the consumer side. Thanks, Chris. I think it's \u2013 we don't know what is the business model. I think it's \u2013 I know this size takes time. And the market is large, a few competitors. All these, you said these are 800 pounds of gorilla, okay. We are well little highs going around \u2013 and we had to run fast. And it's just to take opportunities and okay, what presents the product and our customers. And they do have an eye on the different suppliers especially come from the last couple of years. And it's \u2013 we have a good hope, but we know it take a while. Yes. As we said in next couple of years \u2013 next two years, and we're still on it. And we work with our suppliers and the gaming I just mentioned the consumer business, okay? And one of the reason is we do have obligations and to fill up these facts. And we'll be aggressive and getting all these \u2013 getting these orders, fill the capacities. And that's our gaming in the past. We repeatedly and do this \u2013 have done these kind of things in several cycles already. And this cycle, I don't see a difference from the last downturns. And \u2013 but \u2013 so for the capacity expansion, we're still intact in the game. We're not \u2013 we may slow down a little, so I mean, but we really have obligations with our fabs, okay? Having said that, in the past, in the past two years, now we reached $2 billion companies and they all one point okay, whatever... Yes, 1.8, okay. I mean, our infrastructure hasn't really grown that much. In the last couple of years, and it's difficult to hire people and now we have a lot more breathing room, okay, this is the time to build up a company. I think I believe we gained some shares. Yes. We gained some market shares. Yes, we're a little bit aggressive on in summer low end market."

Please note that this webinar is bring recorded and will be archived for one year on our Investor Relations page at www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. In the course of today\u2019s webinar we will be making forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management\u2019s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q3 2022 earnings release and in our latest 10-K and 10-Q filings that can be found on our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today\u2019s call.  We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our Q3 2022 earnings release, which we have furnished to the SEC and is currently available on our website. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.\nBernie Blegen: Thanks, Gen. First of all, today I\u2019m greeting you from Europe. We held our third quarter Board of Directors meeting in our Barcelona office. We have our Board Members tour of the facility and oversee the operations here.  Now, to the financial results. MPS achieved record third quarter revenue of $495.4 million, 7.5% higher than revenue in the second quarter of 2022, and 53.1% higher than revenue in the third quarter of 2021. This broad based year-over-year revenue growth was the result of consistent executions against our strategies.  Looking at our third quarter 2022 revenue by market. Third quarter automotive revenue of $87.1 million increase 42.7% from the second quarter of 2022, due primarily to new platform launches. Third quarter 2022 automotive revenue was up 60.0% year-over-year. Automotive revenue represented 17.6% of MPSs third quarter 2022 revenue compared with 16.8% in the third quarter of 2021.  Third quarter 2022 communications revenue of $72.3 million is up 21.9% from the second quarter of 2022. Most of the sequential revenue increase was related to the continued communications infrastructure ramp. Third quarter 2022 communications revenue was up 61.8% year-over-year. Communication sales represented 14.6% of our total third quarter 2022 revenue compared with 13.8% in the third quarter of 2021.  In our enterprise data market, third quarter 2022 revenue $75.3 million increased 15.5% from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to continued strength in our data center and workstation computing sales.  Third quarter 2022 revenue represented 15.2% of MPSs third quarter 2022 revenue, compared with 9.2% in the third quarter of 2021. Third quarter 2022 industrial revenue of $58.7 million increased 5.1% from the second quarter of 2022. Third quarter 2022 industrial revenue was up 12.5% year-over-year. Industrial revenue represented 11.8% of our third quarter 2022 revenue compared with 16.1% in the third quarter of 2021.  Storage and computing revenue of $112.9 million decreased 7.7% from the second quarter of 2022. The sequential revenue decline was primarily due to softening of customer demand from notebooks. Third quarter 2022 storage and computing revenue was up 63.9% year-over-year. Storage and computing revenue represented 22.8% of MPS\u2019s third quarter 2022 revenue compared with 21.3% in the third quarter of 2021.  Third quarter consumer revenue of $89.2 million decreased 8.4% from the second quarter of 2022. The sequential quarterly revenue decline was primarily due to softening of overall demand. Third quarter 2022 consumer revenue was up 21.1% year-over-year. Consumer revenue represented 18.0% of MPSs third quarter 2022 revenue, compared with 22.8% in the third quarter of 2021.  Let's talk about the general business conditions. For the prior six quarters, we have faced product shortages, especially in consumer, storage and computing. Now we have started to see our customers reduce their orders and push out shipments. We\u2019ve experienced similar patterns in the past. We anticipate order patterns might oscillate in the near future. This is not a surprise to us. As a result of this change in ordering patterns, our inventory level will catch up to our target of 180 to 200 days and possibly be higher in the near term.  In addition, we have over 4,000 different products which are required to support thousands of our customers' applications. On average, our product lifecycle succeeds six to eight years, so we are not concerned with carrying an inventory level above target. MPSs business is in a better position today. Rather than managing product shortage problems, we can now focus on long-term business development.  For longer cycle, business like automotive, enterprise data, coms infrastructure and industrial, both our customers and MPS have extended significant effort and made joint investments in the development of multiple leading edge products and applications. As a result, we have secured business which we believe will ramp over the next several years driving revenue growth.  For shorter cycle consumer related business, we will continue to proactively support our customers' needs. We have established MPS as a reliable supplier with excellent customer support during this extended period of product shortages. Accordingly, we believe both longer and shorter cycle customers value MPS as a strategic partner.  We are cautious about the overall business conditions and believe we can swiftly adapt to market changes as we have done successfully during similar macroeconomic changes in the past. There have been recent changes to export control rules and additional companies have been added to the MPs list. As of today we see immaterial revenue impact, directly or indirectly from those new trade restrictions. Our products utilize process nodes in excess a 40 nanometer, which falls well outside the current restrictions.  Moving now to a few comments on gross margin and operating income. Third quarter 2022 GAAP gross margin was 58.7%, which was 10 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2022, and 110 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2021.  Our GAAP operating income was $151.9 million compared to $141.9 million reported in the second quarter of 2022. Non GAAP gross margin for the third quarter of 2022 was 59.0%, essentially flat from the gross margin percentage reported in the second quarter of 2022 and 120 basis points higher than the third quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $193.7 million compared to $179.4 million reported in the second quarter of 2022.  Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $139.0 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared with $129.1 million in the second quarter of 2022, and $109.2 million in the third quarter of 2021. Our non GAAP third quarter 2022 operating expenses were $98.4 million, up from $92.7 million in the second quarter of 2022 and up from the $78.7 million reported in the third quarter of 2021.  The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or expense from an unfunded deferred compensation plan.  For the third quarter of 2022, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $1.2 million charged to cost of goods sold was $43.0 million, compared with $42.9 million recorded in the second quarter of 2022.  Switching to the bottom line, third quarter 2022 GAAP net income was $124.3 million or $2.57 per fully diluted share compared with $114.7 million or $2.37 per share in the second quarter of 2022 and $68.8 million or $1.44 per share in the third quarter of 2021. Q3 2022 non GAAP net income was $170.7 million or $3.53 per fully diluted share compared with $157 million or $3.25 per share in the second quarter of 2022, and $98.6 million or $2.06 per share in the third quarter of 2021. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q3, 2022 were $48.3 million.  Now, let\u2019s look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $738.1 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022 compared to $814.1 million at the end of the second quarter of 2022. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $18.2 million compared with Q2, 2022 operating cash flow of $105.2 million. The decline in operating cash flow and increase in other long term assets reflected a $170 million prepaid payment made during the quarter to secure a long term purchasing commitment.  Accounts receivable ended the third quarter of 2022 at $153.4 million, representing 28 days of sales outstanding, which was three days higher than the 25 days reported at the end of the second quarter of 2022, and six days higher than the 22 days at the end of the third quarter of 2021. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2022 were $397.4 million, up $37.8 million from the $359.6 million reported at the end of the second quarter of 2022. Inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2022 represented 167 days, which were five days lower than at the end of the second quarter of 2022.  Historically, we have calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of current order revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter\u2019s revenue provides a better economic match. On this basis, you can see inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2022 represented 189 days, 29 days higher than 160 days at the end of the second quarter of 2022 and 56 days higher than the 133 days at the end of the third quarter of 2021. I would like now to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2022. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $450 million to $470 million. We also expect the following: GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 58.1% to 58.7%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 58.3% to 58.9%. Total stock-based compensation expense of $37.7 million to $39.7 million, including approximately $1.1 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold.  GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses should be between $131 million and $135 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $94.4 million to $96.4 million. Litigation expense in expected to be in the range of $1.3 million and $1.7 million. Interest income is expected to be in the range from $1.1 million to $1.5 million. Fully diluted shares are expected to be in the range of 48.2 million to 49.2 million shares. In conclusion, even though business conditions are softening, our market share gains continue to expand reflecting high customer engagement and our ability to secure design wins. We can now focus on growing our long term business.  I will now open the webinar up for questions. \nA - Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matt your line is now open. \nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much. I guess good evening guys if you're in Europe. So Michael, Bernie can you hear me, okay. \nBernie Blegen : Yeah, buenos noches.\nMatt Ramsay: Thanks guys. So two different questions from me. One sort of related to the model and the near term and the other one on a different topic. So the first question, Bernie, if you could help us a little bit, I mean the guidance was a bit light and you talked about some of the macro conditions, but it seemed like weakness was concentrated in the storage and computing segment. So if you could maybe talk about things by segment and what you're guidance implies on a quarterly basis by segment. I think that would be helpful and then I have a follow up. Thank you. \nBernie Blegen : Sure, just to clarify that the softness that we're seeing is both in the storage and computing as well as consumer. The other segments are still positioned to show growth between Q3 and Q4. The only sort of qualifier that we're still trying to learn about the strength and the runrate of the communications of that segment. So I think what we've done is we feel very, very comfortable with both, how we've been communicating our expected results, but we've added a little conservatism to the outlook. \nMatt Ramsay: Got it. Great! And thank you that. Michael, my second question is on the topic of China, and over the last, I\u2019d say three or four weeks since some of the new commerce and BIS restrictions have come into place, I've been getting a ton of investor questions about this topic with relation to your company on two fronts. I guess the first being, MPS has a significant employee base in China. If you could maybe quantify what maybe percentage of your employees and in what functions are actually in China, and if you've heard from any of these restrictions that there could be any restrictions on those employees need to relocate anybody, those kind of things? And then the second part of the question is on your manufacturing footprint. I know it\u2019s spread across China, Taiwan, increasingly in Korea. We've heard some stories from semi cap companies needing to pull employees out of SMIC for example, in other places because of these new restrictions. So anything in your manufacturing operations that might be disrupted at all because of some of the China restrictions and how far are you guys along or maybe the mix of your capacity that's now outside of China.  You get this nature of the questions, but they've been a pretty frequent and acute over the last three or four weeks. So, it would be great if you could just kind of address some of those topics. Thank you. \nMichael Hsing: Yes, very nice questions. Michael, I'm glad you asked, that what all your concern is I think most of the people totally misconstrued whatever the regulation is. And we do have a presence, we have a large presence within China. This is a U.S. companies, okay, and we\u2019re not subject for sanctions at all. We don't have to have the people to leave \u2013 Americans have to leave an MPS office within China and that's not in the sanction entity list, and we are not in a sanction entity list.  And other one is the manufacturing in the last couple of quarters, we already talked about it. We\u2019ve diversified out of China and we\u2019re starting five, six years ago. Also, I should mention that we talk about it on the engineering manpower. This MPS started at 2017, and we are in Barcelona now. We\u2019ve moved a very large team here with the local government support. We are outside of China, and that's not because we \u2013 because of sanctions, because we want to diversify. Geometrically we\u2019ll \u2013 we will grow into a different region, in the same time zones, wherever we want. We give our customers the better support.\nBernie Blegen : And just to finish up on Michael's comment there, to be perfectly clear, our technology and our products are not subject to restrictions. \nMatt Ramsay: No, thank you very much. Just a really, really quick follow-up. What would you say the percentage Michael of the products or the revenue that is actually sourced from manufacturing footprints inside of China today versus outside. And thank you very much for indulging my question guys, I appreciate it.\nMichael Hsing: It is very convoluted and it is very convoluted and packaging\u2019s and also the process wafer manufacturers, and it's very convoluted, we don't have a clear figures now. But going back to the Bernie\u2019s question and of Bernie\u2019s answers, our technologies, we're using 40 nanometer above and the current sanction is a 14 nanometer below. We are far \u2013 as Bernie mentioned in the script, we are far from that sanctions in the way using the trading edge. We are really using the trading edge of a fab equipment.\nBernie Blegen : And if I can just follow-up on one quick point as we made in our script here, is that as the supply demand imbalance has normalized, that frees us up from just being in pure production mode to actually be able to invest time in business relationships, to be able to expand and diversify our capacity, which we talked about about three quarters ago, where we're going to go from $2 billion of capacity currently to $4 billion within the next two years, two to three years.\nMichael Hsing: These are mostly, we planned these outside of China.\nBernie Blegen : Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is open. \nQuinn Bolton: Thanks. I don't want to pile on the export control questions that Matt was just asked, but I have one other clarification. You're at 40 nanometer and above and so you're not directly affected. But my understanding is that to the extent a facility, a manufacturing facility in China has multiple process nodes, some above 16 nanometer and some below 16 nanometer that that mixed-use facility would be affected.  So I'm just wondering you know, for those Chinese manufacturing facilities, the fab-by-fab, are any of the fabs that you're running 40 nanometer and above, do they also produce 16 nanometer and below and might therefore be affected by equipment and/or support restrictions. \nMichael Hsing: No. These are fab usually, they don't \u2013 advanced fabs, okay, these are 14 nanometer below, and I did not share where these outdated fabs like 40-nanometer above, okay. We're primarily using 65 nanometer. So these are totally different fabs. \nQuinn Bolton: Thanks Michael. That's right, but I just wanted to clarify because I know that yeah, as Matt said, there have been lots of questions on this topic. Maybe one for Bernie. I know you're not guiding beyond the December quarter. But obviously the environment is pretty tough right now, especially on orders. And so I guess as you look out beyond December, can you give us any thoughts as to whether you would see less than normal seasonality in March as some of this weakness continues into next year? And I guess the offset would be, Monolithic Power has some pretty, I think meaningful market share gains, both on the server CPU side, as well as the data center GPU side. When would you think that those share gains start to kick in and might get you back to normal seasonal if not better than seasonal patterns.\nBernie Blegen : Sure. So \u2013 and again Quinn, thank you for focusing on more longer-term and strategic issues here. I think it's very easy to get caught in thinking about next quarter and just the quarter after that. And everything, all the indicators that we're receiving as far as the share gains occurring in the data center are on track. Nothing has been changed there at all.  And then as far as how we look at the next few quarters. Again, when we apply cautiousness to Q4, I think we could expect that anything \u2013 that any growth opportunities are more likely to be weighted in the second half of 2023.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, that's our guess and that's our experience. And I might as well add. You mentioned the CPUs and the CPU power, data centers and MPS is a lot more than that. And you look at Bernie\u2019s, read our script and you have automotive and the data \u2013 the enterprise data centers and other ones in communication - the other ones, the communications, these are still, all of them are grown, except the consumer related notebooks, gaming, those type of things, and as everybody is aware of, they are softening. They swings from shortage to oversupplies and then you know kind of almost overnight.  These kind of things we cannot predict. I mean you guys probably predict it better than we know. We just have to react fast, and the overall MPS business, all these are greenfield products will start to ramp in the last few years and will continue to ramp. \nQuinn Bolton: Sorry Michael, I didn't want to shortchange it by only focusing on the data center opportunity. So, thanks for that color. \nBernie Blegen : Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William your line is now open.\nWilliam Stein : Hey! Thank you so much for taking questions. I have one near-term one and then a longer-term one. From a near-term perspective, I'm hoping you can talk about pricing trends and also how your backlog might be changing in terms of the duration of what you have on the books today versus where we've been recently? And then again, I have a sort of longer-term follow-up question, please.\nMichael Hsing: For shorter terms and I can name this. Here what we see is for the long cycle, longer cycle business is continued. And because there is no questions related to price, okay? Because all the products, they will last four, five years or even longer, okay, and these products are in the ramping cycles.  In the shortest \u2013 in the shorter cycle, consumer related, as I said it earlier, I\u2019ve got notebooks and gamings or the other personal electronics, and these ones okay, they are oversupplied. There's no question \u2013 we don't have any questions about the pricing. And that probably will come in, like in later, another quarter later, what will be a new project design, that\u2019s where we, that\u2019s pricing \u2013 a question, pricing questions will start to emerge.\nBernie Blegen: And well, you also mentioned backlog, the sort of condition in the backlog overall. And relative to historical norms, we still remain very \u2013 you know we're much higher than we have been historically, and \u2013 but this has given us an opportunity to address with our customers. In fact, we've been engaged in these conversations for several quarters now, on what they expect real demand to be. So I think that as far as our book of business is looking ahead, it remains very healthy.\nWilliam Stein : And then the longer-term question, I tend to ask each quarter about some of the you know more differentiated products and services MPS has, modules in particular. I wonder about the traction of those products and whether you're seeing the uptake of that either expand or falter given the current environment? And then same thing with e-commerce, like you have seen more or less of that given the changing demand environment. Thank you. \nMichael Hsing: Yes, all the products, the modules and the e-commerce business okay, and we don't see any changes and they are just continuing and that's where MPS future business would be and we're even more diversified than MPS' current business.\nBernie Blegen : And I think it's interesting as far as market acceptance for the modules. It really is not concentrated in any one \u2013 any market. It's actually pretty evenly distributed against all of our markets. So that to me is a real clear indicator that it fits in well with our diversification strategy.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, frankly if you ask me where these module goes, we don't have ideas and that is the beauty of it.\nWilliam Stein : Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Kwan of Stifel. Jeremy your line is now open. \nJeremy Kwan: Yes, good evening. Can you hear me okay? \nBernie Blegen : Yes. \nJeremy Kwan: Great! Just a couple of questions. First, just looking at the lighting business, it looks like it had a nice increase sequentially this quarter. Is there anything that you can call out there? I just want to understand some of the dynamics in that business.\nBernie Blegen : Automotive.\nJeremy Kwan: I'm sorry, the lighting \u2013 oh! It\u2019s automotive. Okay. That's what's been driving it.\nBernie Blegen : Yes. As we said in the prepared comments, that there were new platforms that were launched, most of them are tied to the 2023 model year and there were probably three areas, lighting being one of them that really contributed to the uplift in the automotive in Q3.\nJeremy Kwan: So this is something that we can look at as a new baseline and the sort of like a steady ramp from here or should we expect kind of more step functions with each new model here?\nMichael Hsing : Well, the lighting is \u2013 in automotive lighting have a variety. You have a down light, you have indicators, all kind of indicators, you have the signals, then you have the headlight, okay. So this is the last couple of quarters you see stepping up and that's kind of, that's part of the Greenfield product and automotive start to ramp. The content in the cars, we're growing the content. For the number of cars we have okay, and just at the beginning, we still have a small, very small market here, so it will continue to grow.\nJeremy Kwan: Got it. Great! And just turning to the long term purchasing agreement that you talked about Bernie, can you give us a little bit more details on this, maybe the magnitude or the size of this deal and you know how different is this from things, the way you may have done business in the past. Just any more detail and help us you know to understand your strategic thinking behind this, that would be very helpful.\nBernie Blegen : Sure. So when you think about the period of the supply-demand imbalance that we came out of, we had actually a superior competitive position because we had invested in our supply chain earlier than our competition, and that allowed us to have part availability when they didn't and that allowed for incremental market share gains. So as we continue to expand capacity, we're looking for new opportunities and with existing as well as with new fabs, and so in this instance we wanted to secure a purchasing agreement that in order \u2013 that gave us dedicated capacity regardless of what the economic environment was.\nJeremy Kwan: Got it, thank you. And then just one last question, just touching again on the modules. Can you give us any insight into the other differences in terms of the manufacturing supply chain that needs to be managed here? And you know in terms of whether it's sourcing or whether it's the geographic footprint. Are there things that you can call there as well?\nMichael Hsing: Most of it \u2013 let me answer it that way. Most of our modules assembly is outside of China.\nJeremy Kwan: Great! Thank you very much. \nOperator: Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open. \nBernie Blegen : Rick, can you hear us?\nRick Schafer: Yes, sorry I was muted. Can you hear me now, Bernie?\nBernie Blegen : Yes.\nRick Schafer: Great. Well hey guys! Thanks for letting me ask you a question. Maybe my first one just on supply. You know TSM, obviously your newest foundry partner, I was just curious if you could kind of level set us on where you guys are at in terms of the qualification process, you know eventual capacity ramp, sort of maybe even get a sense of how much capacity they are going to have for you ultimately and how much of that might be eight versus 12-inch? Just trying to get a better handle on them as a partner.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, most of what we use is 12-inch and also the advanced process modes, of course that thing is in the TSMC. We do use the advanced nodes of gaming and these are for microcontrollers, that type of a product that we do use them and these are not winning in China at all. And a lot of these are product at the very beginning of a ramp and so now we have all the capacities for these new products. Mostly these are for automotive and communications and so now it gives us a lot more room to grow.\nRick Schafer: So Michael, just to kind of get a sense. I mean, is this \u2013 could TSM be sort of a 10% contributor to capacity in say a year's time or is that too aggressive to kind of think of how quickly they could ramp?\nMichael Hsing: On the lower side as we see now.\nRick Schafer: Thanks a lot and then a follow-up, I'm just curious to get an update on silicon carbide progress, particularly traction inverters. I mean how many customers you're engaged with now and when we might expect to see initial revenues? And I know you've talked about it in the past Michael, but just kind of remind us what that dollar content for MPS looks like ex-EV? And I'm assuming it would be sort of subsystem, but would anything be discrete or would that all be sort of module/subsystem?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Thank you very much to ask that question. Yeah, that kind of things, the silicon carbides and the high-power modules okay, that work gets me excited. We do have our first product going through the qualification now; it's working. MPS does not intend to sell as a power device, as a power device only and like a power set only. We will sell within using our combined with our silicon technology produce these small modules.  And we do have many customers engaged in automotive, automotive sections and also the large energy storage and as well as BMS, the car charging stations and those kind of things, we don't have any revenue yet, okay, but it will be in the next few years.\nRick Schafer: And Michael, just a reminder just sort of what it does to content for you guys or potential content in a car or a vehicle?\nMichael Hsing: I think these content will be enormous, okay? I don't even have a - that would be in the billion, and I don't have a \u2013 a couple of billion dollars of opportunity is a smaller. It's a very conservative estimate. Just thinking about it, all the power trains okay, driver trains, all the charging stations, MPS is not going to make and sell a chip only, we\u2019re selling the entire systems.\nRick Schafer: Great! Thanks a lot for all the color. \nOperator: Our next question is from Alex Vecchi of William Blair. Alex, your line is now open. \nAlex Vecchi: Hey everyone! Thanks for taking my questions. Bernie, maybe one for you just on a housekeeping question around gross margins. Can you elaborate a little bit on the down sequential? The only reason I'm asking is given the end market weakness and notebooks in consumer I would have thought is lower gross margin mix. So anything you can do to help on that and how to think of it like from here.\nMichael Hsing: Sure, Alex. So there's a lot of ingredients that play into the gross margin outlook and certainly the direct margin by end market is a significant part of it. Another is the amount of - I don't like to call it necessarily unused capacity. The fixed cost that isn't necessarily absorbed by the same volume. So it's really the fixed cost issue as opposed to the sales mix that's putting a little bit of downward pressure on the gross margin.\nAlex Vecchi: Okay. And then similarly to that extent, just expand on Rick's questions regarding the new fab partner or TSMC. Do you view that relationship eventually being gross margin accretive or dilutive versus your Chinese partners?\nMichael Hsing: Well, these are the events note and we're moving that towards that \u2013 in the territories and therefore these are more microcontrollers, and more highly digital content products and it's a different product. We \u2013 there is no gross margin issues. So in that case we don't go down compete with the price. All the products that we add is more. These are values more in the software side. \nBernie Blegen : And I think that when you look at TSMC, these are new and advanced products that we're developing with them, whereas we're at the same time doing an expansion and diversification away from China and that would include other fabs, both in South Korea as well as in Taiwan.\nAlex Vecchi: Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. With that I\u2019ll go back into queue. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question is from Melissa Fairbanks of Raymond James. Melissa, your line is now open. \nMelissa Fairbanks: Hi guys! Thanks very much. We saw CapEx \u2013 maybe a little longer-term question for you. We saw CapEx dip a little in the third quarter. Maybe could you give us an update on your longer-term capacity planning, not just with TSMC, but more broadly? Does the near-term demand weakness impact those longer-term plans? And then when we're looking at getting to $4 billion in revenue, what's the path to that ramp and the cadence of the investment needed to get there?\nMichael Hsing: Well, it's a \u2013 we always \u2013 if you look at our past. If you look at how we expand our capacity, what is our investment, and if you look at the past eight, nine, 12 years, it's the same pattern as the next four, five years. And we're not going to over invest. We're not going to less invest it, okay.  So the trend, if you look at it. If you're plotting our OpEx and also the growth rate, and it should remain pretty constant in the past four years and in the past eight years, in 12 years, in also the last two or three years the growth pattern is really different from previous four years, and whatever the growth rate we have in the next four years, you can use the plotting \u2013 you can use the same kind of percentage range.\nBernie Blegen : And Melissa, keep in mind that when we do the fab expansion, the capital expenditures are borne by our partners not directly by us. So when you look at our run rate that Michael is referring to, that's more heavily concentrated in test equipment, which can fluctuate from anywhere between $8 million per quarter to $14 million per quarter. It just so happens that we made a lot of those investments earlier in the year, and that's why we're lower.  The other thing that we invest in is that we do buy or we develop our own facilities and those can be layered on and currently there are no investments of any material nature.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, let me clarify this a little more, rather than give you a model. You know MPS, we don't own the fab, we don't own fab equipment, and the cost of associating with capacity expansion, one is we have to qualify the process, and the large portion of it is to qualify our products. We have 4,000, well over 4,000 products, and each product to go through a qualification, that takes about eight to nine months. That cost, that's very costly and so that's \u2013 if we don't \u2013 if we slow down and the demand slows down, we don't have to qualify as fast okay, and so the cost will be spread out. \nBernie Blegen : And those costs are borne in our R&D expenditure line.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Okay great, that\u2019s very clear. Thanks very much guys. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.\nBernie Blegen : Thanks Jen. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call and look forward to talking to you again during the fourth quarter conference call, which is likely to be held in early February. Thank you and have a nice day!",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bernie Blegen",
            "content": "Thanks, Gen. First of all, today I'm greeting you from Europe. We held our third quarter Board of Directors meeting in our Barcelona office. We have our Board Members tour of the facility and oversee the operations here.  Now, to the financial results. MPS achieved record third quarter revenue of $495.4 million, 7.5% higher than revenue in the second quarter of 2022, and 53.1% higher than revenue in the third quarter of 2021. This broad based year-over-year revenue growth was the result of consistent executions against our strategies.  Looking at our third quarter 2022 revenue by market. Third quarter automotive revenue of $87.1 million increase 42.7% from the second quarter of 2022, due primarily to new platform launches. Third quarter 2022 automotive revenue was up 60.0% year-over-year. Automotive revenue represented 17.6% of MPSs third quarter 2022 revenue compared with 16.8% in the third quarter of 2021.  Third quarter 2022 communications revenue of $72.3 million is up 21.9% from the second quarter of 2022. Most of the sequential revenue increase was related to the continued communications infrastructure ramp. Third quarter 2022 communications revenue was up 61.8% year-over-year. Communication sales represented 14.6% of our total third quarter 2022 revenue compared with 13.8% in the third quarter of 2021.  In our enterprise data market, third quarter 2022 revenue $75.3 million increased 15.5% from the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to continued strength in our data center and workstation computing sales.  Third quarter 2022 revenue represented 15.2% of MPSs third quarter 2022 revenue, compared with 9.2% in the third quarter of 2021. Third quarter 2022 industrial revenue of $58.7 million increased 5.1% from the second quarter of 2022. Third quarter 2022 industrial revenue was up 12.5% year-over-year. Industrial revenue represented 11.8% of our third quarter 2022 revenue compared with 16.1% in the third quarter of 2021.  Storage and computing revenue of $112.9 million decreased 7.7% from the second quarter of 2022. The sequential revenue decline was primarily due to softening of customer demand from notebooks. Third quarter 2022 storage and computing revenue was up 63.9% year-over-year. Storage and computing revenue represented 22.8% of MPS's third quarter 2022 revenue compared with 21.3% in the third quarter of 2021.  Third quarter consumer revenue of $89.2 million decreased 8.4% from the second quarter of 2022. The sequential quarterly revenue decline was primarily due to softening of overall demand. Third quarter 2022 consumer revenue was up 21.1% year-over-year. Consumer revenue represented 18.0% of MPSs third quarter 2022 revenue, compared with 22.8% in the third quarter of 2021.  Let's talk about the general business conditions. For the prior six quarters, we have faced product shortages, especially in consumer, storage and computing. Now we have started to see our customers reduce their orders and push out shipments. We've experienced similar patterns in the past. We anticipate order patterns might oscillate in the near future. This is not a surprise to us. As a result of this change in ordering patterns, our inventory level will catch up to our target of 180 to 200 days and possibly be higher in the near term.  In addition, we have over 4,000 different products which are required to support thousands of our customers' applications. On average, our product lifecycle succeeds six to eight years, so we are not concerned with carrying an inventory level above target. MPSs business is in a better position today. Rather than managing product shortage problems, we can now focus on long-term business development.  For longer cycle, business like automotive, enterprise data, coms infrastructure and industrial, both our customers and MPS have extended significant effort and made joint investments in the development of multiple leading edge products and applications. As a result, we have secured business which we believe will ramp over the next several years driving revenue growth.  For shorter cycle consumer related business, we will continue to proactively support our customers' needs. We have established MPS as a reliable supplier with excellent customer support during this extended period of product shortages. Accordingly, we believe both longer and shorter cycle customers value MPS as a strategic partner.  We are cautious about the overall business conditions and believe we can swiftly adapt to market changes as we have done successfully during similar macroeconomic changes in the past. There have been recent changes to export control rules and additional companies have been added to the MPs list. As of today we see immaterial revenue impact, directly or indirectly from those new trade restrictions. Our products utilize process nodes in excess a 40 nanometer, which falls well outside the current restrictions.  Moving now to a few comments on gross margin and operating income. Third quarter 2022 GAAP gross margin was 58.7%, which was 10 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2022, and 110 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2021.  Our GAAP operating income was $151.9 million compared to $141.9 million reported in the second quarter of 2022. Non GAAP gross margin for the third quarter of 2022 was 59.0%, essentially flat from the gross margin percentage reported in the second quarter of 2022 and 120 basis points higher than the third quarter from a year ago. Our non-GAAP operating income was $193.7 million compared to $179.4 million reported in the second quarter of 2022.  Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $139.0 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared with $129.1 million in the second quarter of 2022, and $109.2 million in the third quarter of 2021. Our non GAAP third quarter 2022 operating expenses were $98.4 million, up from $92.7 million in the second quarter of 2022 and up from the $78.7 million reported in the third quarter of 2021.  The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or expense from an unfunded deferred compensation plan.  For the third quarter of 2022, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $1.2 million charged to cost of goods sold was $43.0 million, compared with $42.9 million recorded in the second quarter of 2022.  Switching to the bottom line, third quarter 2022 GAAP net income was $124.3 million or $2.57 per fully diluted share compared with $114.7 million or $2.37 per share in the second quarter of 2022 and $68.8 million or $1.44 per share in the third quarter of 2021. Q3 2022 non GAAP net income was $170.7 million or $3.53 per fully diluted share compared with $157 million or $3.25 per share in the second quarter of 2022, and $98.6 million or $2.06 per share in the third quarter of 2021. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q3, 2022 were $48.3 million.  Now, let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $738.1 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022 compared to $814.1 million at the end of the second quarter of 2022. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $18.2 million compared with Q2, 2022 operating cash flow of $105.2 million. The decline in operating cash flow and increase in other long term assets reflected a $170 million prepaid payment made during the quarter to secure a long term purchasing commitment.  Accounts receivable ended the third quarter of 2022 at $153.4 million, representing 28 days of sales outstanding, which was three days higher than the 25 days reported at the end of the second quarter of 2022, and six days higher than the 22 days at the end of the third quarter of 2021. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2022 were $397.4 million, up $37.8 million from the $359.6 million reported at the end of the second quarter of 2022. Inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2022 represented 167 days, which were five days lower than at the end of the second quarter of 2022.  Historically, we have calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of current order revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's revenue provides a better economic match. On this basis, you can see inventory at the end of the third quarter of 2022 represented 189 days, 29 days higher than 160 days at the end of the second quarter of 2022 and 56 days higher than the 133 days at the end of the third quarter of 2021. I would like now to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2022. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $450 million to $470 million. We also expect the following: GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 58.1% to 58.7%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 58.3% to 58.9%. Total stock-based compensation expense of $37.7 million to $39.7 million, including approximately $1.1 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold.  GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses should be between $131 million and $135 million. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $94.4 million to $96.4 million. Litigation expense in expected to be in the range of $1.3 million and $1.7 million. Interest income is expected to be in the range from $1.1 million to $1.5 million. Fully diluted shares are expected to be in the range of 48.2 million to 49.2 million shares. In conclusion, even though business conditions are softening, our market share gains continue to expand reflecting high customer engagement and our ability to secure design wins. We can now focus on growing our long term business.  I will now open the webinar up for questions. Yeah, buenos noches. Sure, just to clarify that the softness that we're seeing is both in the storage and computing as well as consumer. The other segments are still positioned to show growth between Q3 and Q4. The only sort of qualifier that we're still trying to learn about the strength and the runrate of the communications of that segment. So I think what we've done is we feel very, very comfortable with both, how we've been communicating our expected results, but we've added a little conservatism to the outlook. And just to finish up on Michael's comment there, to be perfectly clear, our technology and our products are not subject to restrictions. And if I can just follow-up on one quick point as we made in our script here, is that as the supply demand imbalance has normalized, that frees us up from just being in pure production mode to actually be able to invest time in business relationships, to be able to expand and diversify our capacity, which we talked about about three quarters ago, where we're going to go from $2 billion of capacity currently to $4 billion within the next two years, two to three years. Yeah. Sure. So \u2013 and again Quinn, thank you for focusing on more longer-term and strategic issues here. I think it's very easy to get caught in thinking about next quarter and just the quarter after that. And everything, all the indicators that we're receiving as far as the share gains occurring in the data center are on track. Nothing has been changed there at all.  And then as far as how we look at the next few quarters. Again, when we apply cautiousness to Q4, I think we could expect that anything \u2013 that any growth opportunities are more likely to be weighted in the second half of 2023. Thank you. And well, you also mentioned backlog, the sort of condition in the backlog overall. And relative to historical norms, we still remain very \u2013 you know we're much higher than we have been historically, and \u2013 but this has given us an opportunity to address with our customers. In fact, we've been engaged in these conversations for several quarters now, on what they expect real demand to be. So I think that as far as our book of business is looking ahead, it remains very healthy. And I think it's interesting as far as market acceptance for the modules. It really is not concentrated in any one \u2013 any market. It's actually pretty evenly distributed against all of our markets. So that to me is a real clear indicator that it fits in well with our diversification strategy. Yes. Automotive. Yes. As we said in the prepared comments, that there were new platforms that were launched, most of them are tied to the 2023 model year and there were probably three areas, lighting being one of them that really contributed to the uplift in the automotive in Q3. Sure. So when you think about the period of the supply-demand imbalance that we came out of, we had actually a superior competitive position because we had invested in our supply chain earlier than our competition, and that allowed us to have part availability when they didn't and that allowed for incremental market share gains. So as we continue to expand capacity, we're looking for new opportunities and with existing as well as with new fabs, and so in this instance we wanted to secure a purchasing agreement that in order \u2013 that gave us dedicated capacity regardless of what the economic environment was. Rick, can you hear us? Yes. And I think that when you look at TSMC, these are new and advanced products that we're developing with them, whereas we're at the same time doing an expansion and diversification away from China and that would include other fabs, both in South Korea as well as in Taiwan. And Melissa, keep in mind that when we do the fab expansion, the capital expenditures are borne by our partners not directly by us. So when you look at our run rate that Michael is referring to, that's more heavily concentrated in test equipment, which can fluctuate from anywhere between $8 million per quarter to $14 million per quarter. It just so happens that we made a lot of those investments earlier in the year, and that's why we're lower.  The other thing that we invest in is that we do buy or we develop our own facilities and those can be layered on and currently there are no investments of any material nature. And those costs are borne in our R&D expenditure line. Thanks Jen. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call and look forward to talking to you again during the fourth quarter conference call, which is likely to be held in early February. Thank you and have a nice day!"

            "name": "Michael Hsing",
            "content": "Yes, very nice questions. Michael, I'm glad you asked, that what all your concern is I think most of the people totally misconstrued whatever the regulation is. And we do have a presence, we have a large presence within China. This is a U.S. companies, okay, and we're not subject for sanctions at all. We don't have to have the people to leave \u2013 Americans have to leave an MPS office within China and that's not in the sanction entity list, and we are not in a sanction entity list.  And other one is the manufacturing in the last couple of quarters, we already talked about it. We've diversified out of China and we're starting five, six years ago. Also, I should mention that we talk about it on the engineering manpower. This MPS started at 2017, and we are in Barcelona now. We've moved a very large team here with the local government support. We are outside of China, and that's not because we \u2013 because of sanctions, because we want to diversify. Geometrically we'll \u2013 we will grow into a different region, in the same time zones, wherever we want. We give our customers the better support. It is very convoluted and it is very convoluted and packaging's and also the process wafer manufacturers, and it's very convoluted, we don't have a clear figures now. But going back to the Bernie's question and of Bernie's answers, our technologies, we're using 40 nanometer above and the current sanction is a 14 nanometer below. We are far \u2013 as Bernie mentioned in the script, we are far from that sanctions in the way using the trading edge. We are really using the trading edge of a fab equipment. These are mostly, we planned these outside of China. No. These are fab usually, they don't \u2013 advanced fabs, okay, these are 14 nanometer below, and I did not share where these outdated fabs like 40-nanometer above, okay. We're primarily using 65 nanometer. So these are totally different fabs. Yes, that's our guess and that's our experience. And I might as well add. You mentioned the CPUs and the CPU power, data centers and MPS is a lot more than that. And you look at Bernie's, read our script and you have automotive and the data \u2013 the enterprise data centers and other ones in communication - the other ones, the communications, these are still, all of them are grown, except the consumer related notebooks, gaming, those type of things, and as everybody is aware of, they are softening. They swings from shortage to oversupplies and then you know kind of almost overnight.  These kind of things we cannot predict. I mean you guys probably predict it better than we know. We just have to react fast, and the overall MPS business, all these are greenfield products will start to ramp in the last few years and will continue to ramp. For shorter terms and I can name this. Here what we see is for the long cycle, longer cycle business is continued. And because there is no questions related to price, okay? Because all the products, they will last four, five years or even longer, okay, and these products are in the ramping cycles.  In the shortest \u2013 in the shorter cycle, consumer related, as I said it earlier, I've got notebooks and gamings or the other personal electronics, and these ones okay, they are oversupplied. There's no question \u2013 we don't have any questions about the pricing. And that probably will come in, like in later, another quarter later, what will be a new project design, that's where we, that's pricing \u2013 a question, pricing questions will start to emerge. Yes, all the products, the modules and the e-commerce business okay, and we don't see any changes and they are just continuing and that's where MPS future business would be and we're even more diversified than MPS' current business. Yes, frankly if you ask me where these module goes, we don't have ideas and that is the beauty of it. Well, the lighting is \u2013 in automotive lighting have a variety. You have a down light, you have indicators, all kind of indicators, you have the signals, then you have the headlight, okay. So this is the last couple of quarters you see stepping up and that's kind of, that's part of the Greenfield product and automotive start to ramp. The content in the cars, we're growing the content. For the number of cars we have okay, and just at the beginning, we still have a small, very small market here, so it will continue to grow. Most of it \u2013 let me answer it that way. Most of our modules assembly is outside of China. Yes, most of what we use is 12-inch and also the advanced process modes, of course that thing is in the TSMC. We do use the advanced nodes of gaming and these are for microcontrollers, that type of a product that we do use them and these are not winning in China at all. And a lot of these are product at the very beginning of a ramp and so now we have all the capacities for these new products. Mostly these are for automotive and communications and so now it gives us a lot more room to grow. On the lower side as we see now. Yes. Thank you very much to ask that question. Yeah, that kind of things, the silicon carbides and the high-power modules okay, that work gets me excited. We do have our first product going through the qualification now; it's working. MPS does not intend to sell as a power device, as a power device only and like a power set only. We will sell within using our combined with our silicon technology produce these small modules.  And we do have many customers engaged in automotive, automotive sections and also the large energy storage and as well as BMS, the car charging stations and those kind of things, we don't have any revenue yet, okay, but it will be in the next few years. I think these content will be enormous, okay? I don't even have a - that would be in the billion, and I don't have a \u2013 a couple of billion dollars of opportunity is a smaller. It's a very conservative estimate. Just thinking about it, all the power trains okay, driver trains, all the charging stations, MPS is not going to make and sell a chip only, we're selling the entire systems. Sure, Alex. So there's a lot of ingredients that play into the gross margin outlook and certainly the direct margin by end market is a significant part of it. Another is the amount of - I don't like to call it necessarily unused capacity. The fixed cost that isn't necessarily absorbed by the same volume. So it's really the fixed cost issue as opposed to the sales mix that's putting a little bit of downward pressure on the gross margin. Well, these are the events note and we're moving that towards that \u2013 in the territories and therefore these are more microcontrollers, and more highly digital content products and it's a different product. We \u2013 there is no gross margin issues. So in that case we don't go down compete with the price. All the products that we add is more. These are values more in the software side. Well, it's a \u2013 we always \u2013 if you look at our past. If you look at how we expand our capacity, what is our investment, and if you look at the past eight, nine, 12 years, it's the same pattern as the next four, five years. And we're not going to over invest. We're not going to less invest it, okay.  So the trend, if you look at it. If you're plotting our OpEx and also the growth rate, and it should remain pretty constant in the past four years and in the past eight years, in 12 years, in also the last two or three years the growth pattern is really different from previous four years, and whatever the growth rate we have in the next four years, you can use the plotting \u2013 you can use the same kind of percentage range. Yes, let me clarify this a little more, rather than give you a model. You know MPS, we don't own the fab, we don't own fab equipment, and the cost of associating with capacity expansion, one is we have to qualify the process, and the large portion of it is to qualify our products. We have 4,000, well over 4,000 products, and each product to go through a qualification, that takes about eight to nine months. That cost, that's very costly and so that's \u2013 if we don't \u2013 if we slow down and the demand slows down, we don't have to qualify as fast okay, and so the cost will be spread out."

Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for 1 year on our Investor Relations page at www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. In the course of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s webinar, we will be making forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release and in our latest 10-K and 10-Q filings that can be found on our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our Q2 2022 earnings release, which we have furnished to the SEC and is currently available on our website. Now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.\nBernie Blegen: Thanks, Gen. MPS achieved record second quarter revenue of $461.0 million, 22.1% higher than the first quarter of 2022, and 57.2% higher than the second quarter of 2021. This broad-based year-over-year revenue growth was a result of consistent execution against our strategies. Turning now to the second quarter 2022 revenue by market, in our enterprise data market, second quarter 2022 revenue of $65.2 million increased 53.4% from the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to an accelerated ramp in our data center and workstation computing sales. Second quarter 2022 revenue was up 117.9% year-over-year. Enterprise data revenue represented 14.2% of MPS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second quarter 2022 revenue compared with 10.2% in the second quarter of 2021. Storage and computing revenue of $122.3 million increased 26.6% from the first quarter of 2022. The sequential revenue improvement reflected higher commercial notebook and storage sales. Second quarter 2022 revenue was up 111.6% year-over-year. Storage and computing revenue represented 26.5% of MPS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second quarter 2022 revenue compared with 19.7% in the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter consumer market revenue of $97.3 million increased 21.7% from the first quarter of 2022. The sequential quarterly revenue improvement was broad-based with particular strength noted in home appliances and gaming. Second quarter 2022 revenue was up 27.9% year-over-year. Consumer revenue represented 21.1% of MPS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second quarter 2022 revenue compared with 25.9% in the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter 2022 industrial revenue of $55.9 million increased 15.1% from the first quarter of 2022, reflecting increased sales of products for power source and security applications. Second quarter 2022 revenue was up 28.9% year-over-year. Industrial revenue represented 12.1% of our total second quarter 2022 revenue compared with 14.8% in the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter automobile revenue of $61.0 million increased 11.9% from the first quarter of 2022. Primarily \u00e2\u0080\u0093 due primarily to increased sales of applications for advanced driver system systems, the digital cockpit and lighting products. Second quarter 2022 revenue was up 25.3% year-over-year. Automotive revenue represented 13.2% of MPS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second quarter 2022 revenue compared with 16.6% in the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter 2022 communications revenue of $59.3 million was up 6.7% from the first quarter of 2022. Most of the sequential revenue increase was related to 5G infrastructure. Second quarter 2022 revenue was up 58.3% year-over-year. Communications sales represented 12.9% of our total second quarter 2022 revenue compared with 12.8% in the second quarter of 2021. Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 58.8%, 90 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2022 and 280 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2021. Our GAAP operating income was $141.9 million compared to $96.1 million reported in the first quarter of 2022 and $60.6 million reported in the second quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2022 was 59.0%, up 70 basis points from the gross margin reported for the first quarter of 2022 and 270 basis points higher than the second quarter from a year ago. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin is attributed largely to operational efficiency gains and a more favorable sales mix. Our non-GAAP operating income was $179.4 million compared to $133.6 million reported in the first quarter of 2022. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $129.1 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared with $122.7 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $103.6 million in the second quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP second quarter 2022 operating expenses were $92.7 million, up from the $86.6 million we spent in the first quarter of 2022 and up from the $70.3 million reported in the second quarter of 2021. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the second quarter of 2022, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $1.2 million charged to cost of goods sold was $42.9 million compared with $39.8 million recorded in the first quarter of 2022. Our second quarter 2022 GAAP other income \u00e2\u0080\u0093 other expense was $5.1 million compared with $634,000 in the first quarter of 2022. Our second quarter 2022 non-GAAP other expense was $7,000 compared with non-GAAP other income of $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2022. The decrease is due to a $2 million increase in charitable contributions, partly offset by the favorable impact of currency exchange rates. The difference in non-GAAP other income and GAAP other income is the income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Switching to the bottom line. Second quarter 2022 GAAP net income was $114.7 million or $2.37 per fully diluted share compared with $79.6 million or $1.65 per share in the first quarter of 2022 and $55.2 million or $1.16 per share in the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter 2022 non-GAAP net income was $157.0 million, or $3.25 per fully diluted share compared with $118.3 million or $2.45 per fully diluted share in the first quarter of 2022 and $86.5 million or $1.81 on a per share \u00e2\u0080\u0093 per fully diluted share in the second quarter of 2021. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q2 2022 were 48.3 million. Now, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $814.1 million at the end of the second quarter of 2022 compared with $775.9 million at the end of the first quarter of 2022. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of approximately $105.2 million compared with Q1 2022 operating cash flow of $107.4 million. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter of 2022 at $125.5 million, representing 25 days of sales outstanding, which was 4 days lower than the 29 days reported at the end of the first quarter of 2022 and 1 day higher than the 24 days in the second quarter of 2021. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter of 2022 were $359.6 million, up from the $311 million at the end of the first quarter of 2022. Days of inventory of 172 days at the end of the second quarter of 2022 were 6 days lower than at the end of the first quarter of 2022. Historically, we have calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of current order revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenue provides a better economic match. On this basis, you can see days of inventory of 162 days at the end of the second quarter of 2022, which were 13 days higher than the 149 days at the end of the first quarter of 2022 and 44 days higher than the 118 days at the end of the second quarter of 2021. I would like now to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2022. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in the range of $480 million to $500 million; GAAP gross margin in the range of 58.4% to 59.0%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 58.7% to 59.3%; total stock-based compensation expense in the range of $42.8 million to $44.8 million, including approximately $1.3 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold; GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $136.2 million and $140.2 million; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses in the range of $94.7 million to $96.7 million; litigation expense in the range between $2.3 million and $2.7 million; interest and other income in the range from $1.3 million to $1.7 million before foreign exchange gains and losses; fully diluted shares in the range of 47.9 million to 48.9 million shares. In conclusion, we are continuing to execute on our growth strategies, including expansion and diversification of our R&D centers and manufacturing partnerships in multiple countries. I will now open the webinar up for questions.\nA - Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session.  Our first question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.\nRick Schafer: Thanks and congratulations to you guys. Another great quarter. This may seem like a silly question given the guidance. But I am just curious, are you seeing any impact from the delayed launch of Sapphire Rapids? I mean I know your accelerator content is a lot higher than your CPU core power content. I think 48-volt, and please correct me if I am wrong, I think our math shows 48-volt track into sort of $100 million this year, so I guess I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just looking at sort of the puts and takes. I know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this is a pretty much a monster guide. But I am just a little curious if you were seeing any drag there from that delayed launch?\nMichael Hsing: So far, we see it for the next year or so. All our growth is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 these are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as you know, these are all growing fields. And again, I mean we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t own the products that were designed in the last few years, like I mean, for whatever the divulging of it, okay. And so if there is a delay the one thing is that we actually care less and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out of MPS control. And \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but overall, we have a new \u00e2\u0080\u0093 has a higher power processor and MPS can provide a much higher benefit to those market segments. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s off for about 1.5 years and 1 years and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t notice it as in this period and where we gain more market shares. And in a way, we grow from this existing business that we have plenty of it to growth.\nRick Schafer: Okay. Thanks a lot, Michael, for the color. And if I could follow-up maybe on the supply question, majority of your wafer supply is still in China, plus you have got to pay your big Chengdu back end facility. So I guess, how concerned are you if with trying to derisk supply chain as we keep watching headlines with the U.S. government trying to tighten restrictions, etcetera on equipment and everything in China? So just curious, your thoughts there? And maybe as part of that, if you could talk about where things stand now with TSMC and give a sense maybe of timing and capacity plans there? Thanks.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Just like any other companies, okay, clearly, we are transitioning out from the last 20 years of manufacturing from China to other places. And all this infrastructure had to be built up. And we are just like other companies. Like we are in a transition, so actually, we started transitioning earlier. We first started from our engineering manpower. So that came in and we transitioned out of 6, 7 years ago \u00e2\u0080\u0093 6 years ago. And manufacturers, we started like 2 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 about 3 years ago and as you know, we always use a trading edge of a DRAM fab, okay or a digital fab. And 3 or 4 years ago, clearly, okay, these are higher node, okay, 60 nanometers and 40 nanometers fabs. Okay, they are all engaged with the MPS, okay. And as we have a reputation, so we will fill up all these fab. And now it opens up in careers and I mean Taiwan and \u00e2\u0080\u0093 these are the places now, okay, we are only talking about a fab this one now. And in the next few years will be, again will be \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a move out of China soon, okay, we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and a still bigger capacity, okay. And we have a large market segment in our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 30% of our revenues still from China. So in the next year or a couple of years later, next year, we probably will be very diversified.\nBernie Blegen: And just to add to that, that as the capacity restrictions are becoming less of a concern for the market in general, customers are asking for diversification as in a China plus one strategy. So we are working along those lines in companion to expanding our overall capacity.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. They all require \u00e2\u0080\u0093 each region center require their local supplied. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we are playing the game. I mean that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our customer request. And so we are fully aware of that. And so we engage with all these fabs. And okay, across South Asia and Europe and Korea and Japan. And so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how I see it.\nRick Schafer: Okay, thanks a lot for the color. Congrats again.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matt, your line is now open.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much, guys. Hopefully, you can hear me okay. Congratulations on the results. So I had two questions, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just go ahead and ask both at the same time because I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got multiple calls going tonight. The first one, Michael, both in the server business, so the new enterprise data segment and in the PC business, could you give us some indication of how far ahead of the unit sales to your power \u00e2\u0080\u0093 your core CPU power or accelerator power products actually sell in versus the unit shipments that they get reported by the end customers? And burning the second question, completely unrelated, like $800 million in cash, give or take, if you could kind of walk us through some of the uses of cash there. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure Michael would like to build some inventory, which is kind of always the case. But if you have any new things to say there, that would be really helpful? Thanks, guys.\nMichael Hsing: Well, first, your first question, honestly, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really know. I mean it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult. And as you know, we sell \u00e2\u0080\u0093 these are building blocks. And for more or less in a server and data center areas, and these are more generic parts, and they can be used multiple awake. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to track. And frankly, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really care. And as long as we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our revenue goes up, right? And for very high powers, and these are power like a 48-volt power, okay? We do have pretty good dominant players in that segment. And so the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think a ramp hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really just started recently. I mean we will be \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in the future, there will be a lot more. But mentioning about \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you mentioned about notebooks, I mean we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re mostly in high-performance gaming or mostly in the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in commercial notebook. And number of assets and versus the CPU \u00e2\u0080\u0093 versus CPUs, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also hard to match in because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re selling these power devices, they can be through 2 phase, they can be 3 phase, They can be 4 phase. I mean we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite note. And also we care less. And so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to answer it. So all these notebooks are all the high end, the high-end gaming side and gaming notebooks and commercial. And so these are the ones that they have a variety of a use.\nBernie Blegen: And on the issue as far as our cash position, which, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s put it on the table, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sort of an enviable position to have over $800 million of cash and cash equivalents. And there is probably three things that we look at. The first is we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been consistently paying out a routine dividend. This year, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $3 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 $0.75 per quarter, $3 for the full year. and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re evaluating the sustainability at a even higher level. We generally announced dividend increases in February, comparing with our Q4 operating results and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect to do so again this year. Another area that we found is very key and strategic to us is building out capacity. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking, as Michael said earlier, for different avenues in order to build out additional capacity. And in some cases, that may require additional investment. And then finally, as you also added is working capital, making sure that we have adequate inventory on hand in order to sustain our customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 demand profile. And so right now, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still below our target of 180 to 200 days of inventory. So we will continue to be investing in inventories as well.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Might as well, all these are Bernie add all the expenses, that they are small compared \u00e2\u0080\u0093 relatively compare the cash that we generate every year. And so what we want to do is that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably MPS know the best, be consistent. And we give \u00e2\u0080\u0093 increase our revenue yearly. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we have been doing in the past few years, and we will continue to do so. And also, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we will do some acquisitions, but not acquisition for revenues.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open.\nWilliam Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great results and outlook. Something I tend to ask about is traction in the module business because I know that this is something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helping boost the revenue growth and the margins. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hoping you can maybe update us on the traction in that business, please?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. The module is doing well, I mean, but the revenue is still quite small. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a hundred-some million dollars, but in \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but I know in the next few years will grow double or triple it. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in the pipeline, in the design win activities. And so as we said a few years ago, we do e-commerce and okay, we do programmable modules these show true benefits to our customers truly realize it in the end.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say that particularly as we had this supply/demand imbalance and our customers are also looking for enabling technologies that the decision process for earning a design win where historically had been just on the lowest cost provider. Now things like the programmability, the flexibility, the time to market, the total cost of ownership are taking a larger weighting in the decision process, and we feel like we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very strategically positioned to take advantage of that change in the market.\nWilliam Stein: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great. And as a follow-up, if I can. I am wondering if you can talk about your lead times now and how they might have changed in the last, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know a couple of months and to the degree to which that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a competitive advantage. My understanding is that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re offering lead times that enable customers to switch away from competitors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 products that have lead times that are so long that it suddenly makes sense to switch. Any sort of comments or update on that would help a lot? Thanks, guys.\nMichael Hsing: Our own lead time really hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t changed that much. And we still \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still in a lot of delinquencies, okay? And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good thing, okay, because as Bernie said earlier, in all the benefit of our product technologies. Okay, finally, our customers realize it, and it became a high demand. And even though and I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s due to the new design win activities. And they all switch to this type of a new technology or new design methodologies. And now that really benefit MPS. And at the same time, we had to increase our capacities. I mean not only from China and globally, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what our customer demands.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. And just to top off that answer is that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think our lead times were necessarily different from anybody else necessarily in the industry. But we have the advantage of having so many new products coming on the market, Greenfield opportunities, that we invested ahead of the curve, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we were able to have product availability when others didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\nWilliam Stein: Thanks, guys.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.\nQuinn Bolton: Hi, guys. Congratulations on the nice results. I guess I would love to ask, obviously, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen some in the compute space Intel and Micron offering much more subdued outlooks for the second half. I think there is clearly some inventory purge going on in the channel. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just wondering, obviously, your September guidance is very strong. But as you look at the order book, have you started to see any changes in the notebook or computer and storage and enterprise data center segment that might echo some of the comments we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard from folks like Intel and Micron in the broader market? And then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a follow-up.\nMichael Hsing: We \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for the notebooks, okay. And for our side, still \u00e2\u0080\u0093 demand is still pretty good and still good, like I mean, and I think as the orders and the orders slow down than before. And but we still have delinquency. And for memory side, for memory side, and there is a lot of new format, okay, starting, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still facing shortages now.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. And if I could just add to that is that we are looking at any areas of our business that might be susceptible to either backlog that is canceled or is pushed out. And keep in mind that cancellations are always a part of all semiconductor companies. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just a one-time or a new event. And the fact of the matter is, is that any influence relative to the size of our overall backlog today is very minor. And so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s given us very confident outlook for the second...\nMichael Hsing: The rate of a booking and the rate of cancellations and I would say they are very similar in the last few years. I mean last few quarters, yes.\nQuinn Bolton: Okay. So no noticeable uptick in cancellations or push-outs, it sounds like is what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying?\nBernie Blegen: Yes.\nQuinn Bolton: Got it. The second question is just enterprise data showing very strong growth, and I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be one of the biggest drivers for the business over the next couple of years, given the Greenfield opportunities. And just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 can you guys size for us, is the accelerator card and 40-gig volt opportunity larger than the share gain on CPU power? Do you think they are both equally sort of driving the growth? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just trying to sort of \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the biggest driver, do you think, for the enterprise dataset?\nMichael Hsing: I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s both. And not only the CPU size for the servers, we gain \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and we gain the market share. We stepped into \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in that game a couple of years ago, but a very small percentage, and we start to ramp. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still far distance, then they need a bigger suppliers. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from the server side. And the 48-volts, as you know, we talk about it. And we talked about since 2017 or \u00e2\u0080\u009818. And we said that this is the inevitable and a trend. You had to go move to 48 volt. And we are now in the forefront of, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not replacing anybody, okay? We set up this market trend. And so \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and also in the data center and the rack itself is a big opportunities and MPS are ramping revenue from there, to from the AC power, and these are 380 volts and I guess, 240 volts input convert into 48 volt. And also the battery backup, and we provide the same \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we provide the solutions for battery management and also cooling side. And so MPS is almost one-stop shopping place for data center.\nQuinn Bolton: Thank you, Michael.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you. First one for Michael. Michael, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re known for driving a lot of new innovative business models and as we now start to think about adding capacity to get to $4 billion, given the geopolitical dynamics and so on and so forth. I know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked a little bit about this, but are you thinking or working on new business models to try and secure more capacity for your continuous growth?\nMichael Hsing: Well, these are one thing, right? We do \u00e2\u0080\u0093 of course, we have the fab, we have the mobile. And we will have increased more capacities outside of China. We started about a couple of years ago, also more than a couple of years ago. And now we engage with some bigger DRAM fabs, okay? We will fill that up in the next couple of years. And \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but going to futures, MPS actually require less semiconductors and because a lot of products are more programmable and we can use for multiple use. And at the same time, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re growing our revenues. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re selling a lot more than semiconductor. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re selling power solutions, more modules. And \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so we kind of move up the food chain as the new requirement comes in, we play in the market, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not competing with anybody. And we just provide the solutions. And so those are manufacturer. These are clearly \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they are different. They are building modules. And we sign up partnerships, okay, for assemble these new modules. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unprecedented. And a lot of testings, a lot of qualifications, MPS designed the whole system from a ground up. And so these are the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 there is no such a facility out there. So we had to invent it, that work.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. And I think just to echo a point there is, if you look at our revenue for the quarter, we grew 57%. And keep in mind that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had one price increase, and that was in February this year for 5%. And so if you actually look at where the source of revenue growth came from, about half of it is volume related, and the other half is higher ASPs because the higher value products are selling. So that means that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve differentiated our supply chains. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not just dependent on silicon-based products. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s making total solutions.\nMichael Hsing: But these are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the bigger effect hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really taken place yet. That would be a couple \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a year or a couple of years down the road, you will see much bigger effect and \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so there is a lot of the new \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a lot of work to do ahead of us. And these are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 particularly, these are new types of modules. Nobody else build the kind of things, okay? We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ground up, we developed and we even develop a manufacturing and as well as testing the qualifications part of it.\nTore Svanberg: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great, great perspective. Thank you for that, Michael, as my follow-up, and this is related to what you just mentioned there, Bernie, which is pricing. I know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re obviously growing by adding more value and higher ASP products. But you mentioned that 5% price increases. I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well documented that your competitors have raised prices by more than that. So I guess my question is just simply that, are you gaining a lot of share because you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t engage in aggressive price increases as some of your customers? I mean, your competitors, sorry.\nMichael Hsing: Gaining share, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 gaining share is a difficult to count because gaining share, if the equals product is gaining share and going to be in a similar product. And \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so you \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our price betters, our performance better, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gaining shares. Okay. Now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about completely different things. And those market segments we want to get in there is less price sensitive, but quality, performance a lot more important. And now okay, we offer something that is a lot more than that. And 10 years ago, we said who do we compete with? And not a company sell controller and power MOSFET, they are separate, MPS is integrated. And now you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about MPS, we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our product even on the silicon side. And we have microcontroller, we have a memory, we have digital, we have power. And very unique how we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 who do we display. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to say it. Now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting to use these type of silicon-based technology, we migrate out. We became a provider of total solutions. So how do we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 who do we display, and okay, how we gain market share? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very difficult to say.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. No, it sounds like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re displacing more and more companies than before. Just one last quick one for you, Bernie. Most companies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 DSOs were up this quarter because of the China lockdowns, shipments being later in the quarter. Your DSOs actually went down this quarter. So, can you just talk a little bit about how the China lockdown impacted you? I mean obviously, it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t impact it the same way, but any other color you can share with us, that would be great? Thanks.\nBernie Blegen: No, we really didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much impact from the China shutdown. Obviously, we were able to record revenue growth that is well above the industry average. And the concern we might have had is if our customer supply chains got impacted. But we continue to hit our delivery schedules. And if there was an impact, I am sure we felt some of it, but it was very marginal.\nTore Svanberg: Right. Thank you and congrats on the strong results.\nMichael Hsing: Thank you.\nBernie Blegen: Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.\nRoss Seymore: Thanks guys for asking question. First question is really kind of a high-level one. Over the years, you guys have generally outperformed the analog market by maybe 10 or 15 percentage points of growth and gain share, etcetera, etcetera. Even last year wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t terribly outside of that range. But this year, it seems like that delta probably doubles at least, maybe something more. So, I do get investors that are concerned that your increased availability versus the peers allows you to ship and then it can be double shipping in response to the double ordering. And so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a cyclical phenomenon that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s widening that gap. Can you just talk about the reasons you think that gap is sustainable? And then looking forward, do you think that gap will continue to grow despite the fact that you are operating off of a larger base?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. I think what you said partially is correct. I mean the other company couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ship, okay, we have the inventories and again, we have a capacity to ship. But this year, particularly, we see things are very different. And a lot of products, especially we ship to these Tier 1 companies are from the industrial side, from automotive side and even the data centers. And they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t intend to have MPS has a big \u00e2\u0080\u0093 has a majority as a bigger supplier, where they give us as a backup and to test a lot. And in the last years, we shipped all these units, our failures, okay. We are far better than everybody else, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one thing. The quality of \u00e2\u0080\u0093 quality is everything. And \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but they took a chance when they have shortages. And so we proved that, give us a bigger opportunity. We proved it, these products as better. Okay, as good as better than our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 whatever the parts they design them out. And in the last year, this year, all the new product or the new segment start to grow out. And as our product, we can change it, we can reconfigure it. And that will continue, we continue to grow up. And as we see it at, we cannot handle all the projects. And so in the foreseeable features and these products will continue to grow.\nBernie Blegen: And keep in mind that we are still facing large delinquencies ourselves. And so we have had to be very cautious and opportunistic as far as how we allocate our wafer starts in order to meet real customer demand. So, I think we have been clear that during the first half of the year, we did a cleanup of double orders and have confirmed, as I said earlier, the MPS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 backlog still remains very healthy. And then when you look at the inventory in the channel, we are at lows. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very lean. And we believe we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have perfect insight, that the inventory on our customer shelves is likewise very lean because we have only been doing partial shipments there. So, as far as the markets we feel reasonably confident, obviously, notebook or some of the consumer could give us, we are trying to stay very close to that and evaluate its impact. But as Michael said, a lot of our new growth opportunities are in these large Tier 1 opportunities. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that secular growth that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really driving it. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s different from just building up in the channel or on customer shelves.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. I will come back to your questions. Okay. Now you said that you are growing a large basis, so you grow, okay, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to grow. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of a built in everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind, okay? In my mind, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a limit. And the limit is within yourself, what to do. And people told me, okay, early on $200 million, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your barriers, like $500 million of barriers. $200 million at the time, it was a barrier at one time. It happened. And $500 million, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t okay, then people tell me, okay, you are going to grow $1 billion, you need to slowdown. And at the time seriously, that was 2017, 2017 or \u00e2\u0080\u009818, yes, \u00e2\u0080\u009817, I actually said it, okay, when we get to $1 billion, we are going to accelerate it. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at the time, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how I see it. And now, okay, MPS, we are not selling silicon anymore. We are selling raw more than the silicon, and why not accelerating the growth. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 of course, I am not saying that now okay, a lot of things still depend on our execution. But only thing is the mindset when not dwell on selling semiconductors. And selling semiconductor is limited, but you have a lot of service engineering manpower, we can \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our customers can benefit to it. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlimited almost.\nBernie Blegen: And supporting Michael\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point there, you might remember six quarters or seven quarters ago, we made the statement that by the end of Q2 of \u00e2\u0080\u009822 that we would have capacity to support a $2 billion revenue run rate. And I think that the key there is the execution and the focus and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly what we have done.\nRoss Seymore: Hi. Thanks for all that color guys. I guess hopefully, a quicker follow-up to all of this as you expand beyond the semiconductor side, you get into \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to say systems, but more solutions in general, some of the stuff you talked about with the entire rack, the AC to DC, the cooling, all the above. What do we look at the gross margin doing in that? That sounds like higher gross margin business. And I know consistency of gross margin expansion is the mantra that you guys have lived by and delivered on. But it seems like mix would go in a big tail or would be a big tailwind for you going forward from a gross margin perspective. So, just talk about what this changing in your revenue mix means, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end market or system solutions versus chips to your gross margin?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of things we are going to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 of course I can all I will say, okay, we can charge as much as our customers available, okay. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of a half BS , okay. And \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but the reality is I think that we are comfortably stay around this mid to high-50s and 55% to 60% in the range. I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sweet spot for us. We are not going to print the corners for us to grow to over 70%. And when we get that, we get that, okay. So far, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have headwinds. And I think the opportunity drives the model itself. In the next couple of years, I think that we are going to stay around this as we are now. So, maybe move up a slide later. I mean we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have \u00e2\u0080\u0093 at least we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the headwinds. And so after 3 years or 4 years we will see how we change our models.\nBernie Blegen: Right. I would just add that I think that we reported gross margin of 59.0%. And as Michael said, somewhere in that area is sort of the sweet spot for our model that allows us also to accelerate our rate of revenue growth. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that we will continue to evaluate. But I think right now, we are very comfortable with this being our model.\nMichael Hsing: We are not chasing the volumes going down. We are not actually MPS is not good at chasing our volume. We are not doing these manufacturing, okay. Actually, MPS doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t manufacture anything and the high-volume things, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not MPS forte.\nRoss Seymore: Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Melissa Fairbanks of Raymond James. Melissa, your line is now open.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Hi guys. Thanks very much. I will echo the congratulations on another great quarter. I just had two really quick ones for you. First, could you remind us what your inventory target or ideal levels of inventory would be in order to maybe clear some of the delinquencies? And then second, on a somewhat related note, what should we be thinking about for CapEx this year, either as a percentage of revenue or absolute investment. And then what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the longer term requirements you need in order to meet your demand or your growth plans?\nBernie Blegen: Good questions. So, as far as inventory, keep in mind that being so much of our positioning is around growth that as sort of a risk management decision. We believe that 180 days to 200 days of inventory is what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needed so that we can manage an upside in customer demand, but also if we end up in an unfortunate situation where we have lots of inventory that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sellable that we can compensate for that without having any disruption to our customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 production lines. So, I think that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been difficult to manage delinquencies while increasing inventories in order to support our model. But I think we have done a pretty good job in these really unusual times. And then as far as the capital requirements, I think we have talked in the past as far as what our spending rate is. It tends to be on a quarterly basis, can be somewhere between $14 million and $18 million per quarter with a lot of that being testing equipment or even if we are purchasing buildings, we purchase our own office space. And the first half of this year was a little bit lighter than our normal run rate. But I think 14 to 18, absent a big building purchase, is probably a good run-rate.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Okay, great. Thanks very much. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all for me.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Alessandra Vecchi of William Blair. Alex , your line is now open. \nAlessandra Vecchi: Sorry, I was muted. Apologies. I will start over. Bernie, can you hear me? Michael, can you hear me?\nMichael Hsing: Yes.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. Hi Alex.\nAlessandra Vecchi: Apologies about that user error here. I was saying apologies again, if someone has already asked this question, but I wanted to expand a little bit on Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099 question, just in terms of the competitive dynamic in your products being superior to those of the competition as well as more of the solution sale. How do we think about power management, in particular, and your positioning within the customer as these products become more complicated, you take up more space on the board, I would assume that those conversations are becoming more tightly coupled and that you guys are becoming more important to the customer in terms of conversation?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Look, I mean we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and as a matter of fact, the form of MPS, from the beginning, so we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sell pin-to-pin comparables, okay. We \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in a similar product, we offer the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 actually, we are always a far better product. And much compact, much higher efficiencies. And as an also cost to play without the armor charge on the late and that is known for MPS, okay, and a one-time it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early period of time, the MPS is like a price, kind of companies. And we actually \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, that means that we left a little lot of dollars on the table. And of course, we are not competing in that market segment anymore. Now okay, we offer either total solutions. And if you do \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if you are mentioning up \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if you are talking about any applications, they need power. And we are talking about electrical car, MPS can build a whole car and use electronics. And you want to build the data centers, MPS provides the entire product for data centers, and we are mostly there. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how we sell value. And we are not competing on this product competes with that product. We have all software behind it. And we have user interface, okay, software that changes the game. We are not competing with the product per se anymore.\nBernie Blegen: I think an interesting dynamic that we have been observing is that power management was always an afterthought. It was the last thing after you designed your board and you came up with the least bad solution. Now, we are introduced at the very front end of the development of an application. And the reason is, is because our power solutions enable our customers to be able to develop higher-power solutions than they would otherwise. So, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an interesting twist in the relationship where we are being introduced more earlier to the process and able to jointly come up with the development of shared solutions.\nMichael Hsing: As you see \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as you remember, MPS like 4 years ago, we actually built a car. Built a very advanced car and far advanced than any car that you see in the market. And with battery management and same time, all the motor controls, a lot more complex than the existing EV. And so just for the purpose, we can demonstrate we can do it. And now we can do it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and 4 years later, actually, we can do a lot more than that. And so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of examples.\nAlessandra Vecchi: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extremely helpful. And then, Bernie, just one last quick question, in terms of the guidance, any end market that we should think of or how should we think about the end markets in terms of strength versus \u00e2\u0080\u0093 strongest versus weakest strength, any notable things to call out?\nBernie Blegen: Yes. I think that the themes that you are going to be seeing for the next 2 years to 3 years are the enterprise data and automotive. Automotive had a relatively slow first half, but that was exactly what we had in our expectations. There was no new surprise there. And we believe that in the second half, it looks very healthy as does the data center.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, as we see it. And okay, as we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 okay, what will we provide, not customer asked for it? Yes, we will do that, a customer do that. We should lead to customers. So, what you should need. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the game we are really playing, okay. We are playing ahead of game. And I think that all the power stuff like 48 volts, we said that this is like \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we said that in 2017, okay, this is the futures, and we anticipated that. Electrical cars, we anticipated that. And so now we can, in the next few years, and we will see the very similar things that we will see all of these will happen.\nAlessandra Vecchi: Perfect. Thank you so much. Congratulations again.\nBernie Blegen: Thank you, Alex.\nGenevieve Cunningham:  As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.\nBernie Blegen: Great. Thanks Gen. I would like to thank you all for joining us on the webinar and look forward to talking to you again during the third quarter, which will likely be at the end of October. Thank you. Have a nice day.",

            "name": "Bernie Blegen",
            "content": "Thanks, Gen. MPS achieved record second quarter revenue of $461.0 million, 22.1% higher than the first quarter of 2022, and 57.2% higher than the second quarter of 2021. This broad-based year-over-year revenue growth was a result of consistent execution against our strategies. Turning now to the second quarter 2022 revenue by market, in our enterprise data market, second quarter 2022 revenue of $65.2 million increased 53.4% from the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to an accelerated ramp in our data center and workstation computing sales. Second quarter 2022 revenue was up 117.9% year-over-year. Enterprise data revenue represented 14.2% of MPSa\u0302\u0080\u0099s second quarter 2022 revenue compared with 10.2% in the second quarter of 2021. Storage and computing revenue of $122.3 million increased 26.6% from the first quarter of 2022. The sequential revenue improvement reflected higher commercial notebook and storage sales. Second quarter 2022 revenue was up 111.6% year-over-year. Storage and computing revenue represented 26.5% of MPSa\u0302\u0080\u0099s second quarter 2022 revenue compared with 19.7% in the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter consumer market revenue of $97.3 million increased 21.7% from the first quarter of 2022. The sequential quarterly revenue improvement was broad-based with particular strength noted in home appliances and gaming. Second quarter 2022 revenue was up 27.9% year-over-year. Consumer revenue represented 21.1% of MPSa\u0302\u0080\u0099s second quarter 2022 revenue compared with 25.9% in the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter 2022 industrial revenue of $55.9 million increased 15.1% from the first quarter of 2022, reflecting increased sales of products for power source and security applications. Second quarter 2022 revenue was up 28.9% year-over-year. Industrial revenue represented 12.1% of our total second quarter 2022 revenue compared with 14.8% in the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter automobile revenue of $61.0 million increased 11.9% from the first quarter of 2022. Primarily a\u0302\u0080\u0093 due primarily to increased sales of applications for advanced driver system systems, the digital cockpit and lighting products. Second quarter 2022 revenue was up 25.3% year-over-year. Automotive revenue represented 13.2% of MPSa\u0302\u0080\u0099s second quarter 2022 revenue compared with 16.6% in the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter 2022 communications revenue of $59.3 million was up 6.7% from the first quarter of 2022. Most of the sequential revenue increase was related to 5G infrastructure. Second quarter 2022 revenue was up 58.3% year-over-year. Communications sales represented 12.9% of our total second quarter 2022 revenue compared with 12.8% in the second quarter of 2021. Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 58.8%, 90 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2022 and 280 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2021. Our GAAP operating income was $141.9 million compared to $96.1 million reported in the first quarter of 2022 and $60.6 million reported in the second quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2022 was 59.0%, up 70 basis points from the gross margin reported for the first quarter of 2022 and 270 basis points higher than the second quarter from a year ago. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin is attributed largely to operational efficiency gains and a more favorable sales mix. Our non-GAAP operating income was $179.4 million compared to $133.6 million reported in the first quarter of 2022. Leta\u0302\u0080\u0099s review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $129.1 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared with $122.7 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $103.6 million in the second quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP second quarter 2022 operating expenses were $92.7 million, up from the $86.6 million we spent in the first quarter of 2022 and up from the $70.3 million reported in the second quarter of 2021. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the second quarter of 2022, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $1.2 million charged to cost of goods sold was $42.9 million compared with $39.8 million recorded in the first quarter of 2022. Our second quarter 2022 GAAP other income a\u0302\u0080\u0093 other expense was $5.1 million compared with $634,000 in the first quarter of 2022. Our second quarter 2022 non-GAAP other expense was $7,000 compared with non-GAAP other income of $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2022. The decrease is due to a $2 million increase in charitable contributions, partly offset by the favorable impact of currency exchange rates. The difference in non-GAAP other income and GAAP other income is the income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Switching to the bottom line. Second quarter 2022 GAAP net income was $114.7 million or $2.37 per fully diluted share compared with $79.6 million or $1.65 per share in the first quarter of 2022 and $55.2 million or $1.16 per share in the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter 2022 non-GAAP net income was $157.0 million, or $3.25 per fully diluted share compared with $118.3 million or $2.45 per fully diluted share in the first quarter of 2022 and $86.5 million or $1.81 on a per share a\u0302\u0080\u0093 per fully diluted share in the second quarter of 2021. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q2 2022 were 48.3 million. Now, leta\u0302\u0080\u0099s look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $814.1 million at the end of the second quarter of 2022 compared with $775.9 million at the end of the first quarter of 2022. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of approximately $105.2 million compared with Q1 2022 operating cash flow of $107.4 million. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter of 2022 at $125.5 million, representing 25 days of sales outstanding, which was 4 days lower than the 29 days reported at the end of the first quarter of 2022 and 1 day higher than the 24 days in the second quarter of 2021. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter of 2022 were $359.6 million, up from the $311 million at the end of the first quarter of 2022. Days of inventory of 172 days at the end of the second quarter of 2022 were 6 days lower than at the end of the first quarter of 2022. Historically, we have calculated days of inventory on hand as a function of current order revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quartera\u0302\u0080\u0099s revenue provides a better economic match. On this basis, you can see days of inventory of 162 days at the end of the second quarter of 2022, which were 13 days higher than the 149 days at the end of the first quarter of 2022 and 44 days higher than the 118 days at the end of the second quarter of 2021. I would like now to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2022. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in the range of $480 million to $500 million; GAAP gross margin in the range of 58.4% to 59.0%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 58.7% to 59.3%; total stock-based compensation expense in the range of $42.8 million to $44.8 million, including approximately $1.3 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold; GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $136.2 million and $140.2 million; non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses in the range of $94.7 million to $96.7 million; litigation expense in the range between $2.3 million and $2.7 million; interest and other income in the range from $1.3 million to $1.7 million before foreign exchange gains and losses; fully diluted shares in the range of 47.9 million to 48.9 million shares. In conclusion, we are continuing to execute on our growth strategies, including expansion and diversification of our R&D centers and manufacturing partnerships in multiple countries. I will now open the webinar up for questions. And just to add to that, that as the capacity restrictions are becoming less of a concern for the market in general, customers are asking for diversification as in a China plus one strategy. So we are working along those lines in companion to expanding our overall capacity. And on the issue as far as our cash position, which, leta\u0302\u0080\u0099s put it on the table, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s sort of an enviable position to have over $800 million of cash and cash equivalents. And there is probably three things that we look at. The first is wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve been consistently paying out a routine dividend. This year, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s $3 a\u0302\u0080\u0093 $0.75 per quarter, $3 for the full year. and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re evaluating the sustainability at a even higher level. We generally announced dividend increases in February, comparing with our Q4 operating results and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099d expect to do so again this year. Another area that we found is very key and strategic to us is building out capacity. And wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re looking, as Michael said earlier, for different avenues in order to build out additional capacity. And in some cases, that may require additional investment. And then finally, as you also added is working capital, making sure that we have adequate inventory on hand in order to sustain our customersa\u0302\u0080\u0099 demand profile. And so right now, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re still below our target of 180 to 200 days of inventory. So we will continue to be investing in inventories as well. Yes. Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099d say that particularly as we had this supply/demand imbalance and our customers are also looking for enabling technologies that the decision process for earning a design win where historically had been just on the lowest cost provider. Now things like the programmability, the flexibility, the time to market, the total cost of ownership are taking a larger weighting in the decision process, and we feel like wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re very strategically positioned to take advantage of that change in the market. Yes. And just to top off that answer is that I dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t think our lead times were necessarily different from anybody else necessarily in the industry. But we have the advantage of having so many new products coming on the market, Greenfield opportunities, that we invested ahead of the curve, and thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s where we were able to have product availability when others didna\u0302\u0080\u0099t. Yes. And if I could just add to that is that we are looking at any areas of our business that might be susceptible to either backlog that is canceled or is pushed out. And keep in mind that cancellations are always a part of all semiconductor companies. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s not just a one-time or a new event. And the fact of the matter is, is that any influence relative to the size of our overall backlog today is very minor. And so thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s whata\u0302\u0080\u0099s given us very confident outlook for the second... Yes. Yes. And I think just to echo a point there is, if you look at our revenue for the quarter, we grew 57%. And keep in mind that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve had one price increase, and that was in February this year for 5%. And so if you actually look at where the source of revenue growth came from, about half of it is volume related, and the other half is higher ASPs because the higher value products are selling. So that means that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve differentiated our supply chains. So wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re not just dependent on silicon-based products. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s making total solutions. No, we really didna\u0302\u0080\u0099t have much impact from the China shutdown. Obviously, we were able to record revenue growth that is well above the industry average. And the concern we might have had is if our customer supply chains got impacted. But we continue to hit our delivery schedules. And if there was an impact, I am sure we felt some of it, but it was very marginal. Thank you. And keep in mind that we are still facing large delinquencies ourselves. And so we have had to be very cautious and opportunistic as far as how we allocate our wafer starts in order to meet real customer demand. So, I think we have been clear that during the first half of the year, we did a cleanup of double orders and have confirmed, as I said earlier, the MPSa\u0302\u0080\u0099 backlog still remains very healthy. And then when you look at the inventory in the channel, we are at lows. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s very lean. And we believe we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t have perfect insight, that the inventory on our customer shelves is likewise very lean because we have only been doing partial shipments there. So, as far as the markets we feel reasonably confident, obviously, notebook or some of the consumer could give us, we are trying to stay very close to that and evaluate its impact. But as Michael said, a lot of our new growth opportunities are in these large Tier 1 opportunities. And ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s that secular growth thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s really driving it. And thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s different from just building up in the channel or on customer shelves. And supporting Michaela\u0302\u0080\u0099s point there, you might remember six quarters or seven quarters ago, we made the statement that by the end of Q2 of a\u0302\u0080\u009822 that we would have capacity to support a $2 billion revenue run rate. And I think that the key there is the execution and the focus and thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s exactly what we have done. Right. I would just add that I think that we reported gross margin of 59.0%. And as Michael said, somewhere in that area is sort of the sweet spot for our model that allows us also to accelerate our rate of revenue growth. So, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s something that we will continue to evaluate. But I think right now, we are very comfortable with this being our model. Good questions. So, as far as inventory, keep in mind that being so much of our positioning is around growth that as sort of a risk management decision. We believe that 180 days to 200 days of inventory is whata\u0302\u0080\u0099s needed so that we can manage an upside in customer demand, but also if we end up in an unfortunate situation where we have lots of inventory that arena\u0302\u0080\u0099t sellable that we can compensate for that without having any disruption to our customersa\u0302\u0080\u0099 production lines. So, I think that ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s been difficult to manage delinquencies while increasing inventories in order to support our model. But I think we have done a pretty good job in these really unusual times. And then as far as the capital requirements, I think we have talked in the past as far as what our spending rate is. It tends to be on a quarterly basis, can be somewhere between $14 million and $18 million per quarter with a lot of that being testing equipment or even if we are purchasing buildings, we purchase our own office space. And the first half of this year was a little bit lighter than our normal run rate. But I think 14 to 18, absent a big building purchase, is probably a good run-rate. Yes. Hi Alex. I think an interesting dynamic that we have been observing is that power management was always an afterthought. It was the last thing after you designed your board and you came up with the least bad solution. Now, we are introduced at the very front end of the development of an application. And the reason is, is because our power solutions enable our customers to be able to develop higher-power solutions than they would otherwise. So, thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s an interesting twist in the relationship where we are being introduced more earlier to the process and able to jointly come up with the development of shared solutions. Yes. I think that the themes that you are going to be seeing for the next 2 years to 3 years are the enterprise data and automotive. Automotive had a relatively slow first half, but that was exactly what we had in our expectations. There was no new surprise there. And we believe that in the second half, it looks very healthy as does the data center. Thank you, Alex. Great. Thanks Gen. I would like to thank you all for joining us on the webinar and look forward to talking to you again during the third quarter, which will likely be at the end of October. Thank you. Have a nice day."

            "name": "Michael Hsing",
            "content": "So far, we see it for the next year or so. All our growth is a\u0302\u0080\u0093 these are a\u0302\u0080\u0093 as you know, these are all growing fields. And again, I mean we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t own the products that were designed in the last few years, like I mean, for whatever the divulging of it, okay. And so if there is a delay the one thing is that we actually care less and ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s out of MPS control. And a\u0302\u0080\u0093 but overall, we have a new a\u0302\u0080\u0093 has a higher power processor and MPS can provide a much higher benefit to those market segments. So, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s off for about 1.5 years and 1 years and we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t notice it as in this period and where we gain more market shares. And in a way, we grow from this existing business that we have plenty of it to growth. Yes. Just like any other companies, okay, clearly, we are transitioning out from the last 20 years of manufacturing from China to other places. And all this infrastructure had to be built up. And we are just like other companies. Like we are in a transition, so actually, we started transitioning earlier. We first started from our engineering manpower. So that came in and we transitioned out of 6, 7 years ago a\u0302\u0080\u0093 6 years ago. And manufacturers, we started like 2 a\u0302\u0080\u0093 about 3 years ago and as you know, we always use a trading edge of a DRAM fab, okay or a digital fab. And 3 or 4 years ago, clearly, okay, these are higher node, okay, 60 nanometers and 40 nanometers fabs. Okay, they are all engaged with the MPS, okay. And as we have a reputation, so we will fill up all these fab. And now it opens up in careers and I mean Taiwan and a\u0302\u0080\u0093 these are the places now, okay, we are only talking about a fab this one now. And in the next few years will be, again will be a\u0302\u0080\u0093 I cana\u0302\u0080\u0099t say ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a move out of China soon, okay, we a\u0302\u0080\u0093 and a still bigger capacity, okay. And we have a large market segment in our a\u0302\u0080\u0093 30% of our revenues still from China. So in the next year or a couple of years later, next year, we probably will be very diversified. Yes. They all require a\u0302\u0080\u0093 each region center require their local supplied. Thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s where we are playing the game. I mean thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s our customer request. And so we are fully aware of that. And so we engage with all these fabs. And okay, across South Asia and Europe and Korea and Japan. And so thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s how I see it. Well, first, your first question, honestly, I dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t really know. I mean ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s difficult. And as you know, we sell a\u0302\u0080\u0093 these are building blocks. And for more or less in a server and data center areas, and these are more generic parts, and they can be used multiple awake. And ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s hard to track. And frankly, we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t really care. And as long as we a\u0302\u0080\u0093 our revenue goes up, right? And for very high powers, and these are power like a 48-volt power, okay? We do have pretty good dominant players in that segment. And so the a\u0302\u0080\u0093 I think a ramp hasna\u0302\u0080\u0099t really just started recently. I mean we will be a\u0302\u0080\u0093 in the future, there will be a lot more. But mentioning about a\u0302\u0080\u0093 you mentioned about notebooks, I mean wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re mostly in high-performance gaming or mostly in the a\u0302\u0080\u0093 in commercial notebook. And number of assets and versus the CPU a\u0302\u0080\u0093 versus CPUs, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s also hard to match in because wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re selling these power devices, they can be through 2 phase, they can be 3 phase, They can be 4 phase. I mean we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t quite note. And also we care less. And so ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s difficult to answer it. So all these notebooks are all the high end, the high-end gaming side and gaming notebooks and commercial. And so these are the ones that they have a variety of a use. Yes. Might as well, all these are Bernie add all the expenses, that they are small compared a\u0302\u0080\u0093 relatively compare the cash that we generate every year. And so what we want to do is thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s probably MPS know the best, be consistent. And we give a\u0302\u0080\u0093 increase our revenue yearly. And thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s what we have been doing in the past few years, and we will continue to do so. And also, we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t want a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we will do some acquisitions, but not acquisition for revenues. Yes. The module is doing well, I mean, but the revenue is still quite small. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a hundred-some million dollars, but in a\u0302\u0080\u0093 but I know in the next few years will grow double or triple it. And thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s what wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve seen in the pipeline, in the design win activities. And so as we said a few years ago, we do e-commerce and okay, we do programmable modules these show true benefits to our customers truly realize it in the end. Our own lead time really hasna\u0302\u0080\u0099t changed that much. And we still a\u0302\u0080\u0093 wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re still in a lot of delinquencies, okay? And thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s a good thing, okay, because as Bernie said earlier, in all the benefit of our product technologies. Okay, finally, our customers realize it, and it became a high demand. And even though and I think ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s due to the new design win activities. And they all switch to this type of a new technology or new design methodologies. And now that really benefit MPS. And at the same time, we had to increase our capacities. I mean not only from China and globally, thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s what our customer demands. We a\u0302\u0080\u0093 for the notebooks, okay. And for our side, still a\u0302\u0080\u0093 demand is still pretty good and still good, like I mean, and I think as the orders and the orders slow down than before. And but we still have delinquency. And for memory side, for memory side, and there is a lot of new format, okay, starting, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re still facing shortages now. The rate of a booking and the rate of cancellations and I would say they are very similar in the last few years. I mean last few quarters, yes. I think ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s both. And not only the CPU size for the servers, we gain a\u0302\u0080\u0093 and we gain the market share. We stepped into a\u0302\u0080\u0093 in that game a couple of years ago, but a very small percentage, and we start to ramp. But wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re still far distance, then they need a bigger suppliers. And thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s one of a\u0302\u0080\u0093 from the server side. And the 48-volts, as you know, we talk about it. And we talked about since 2017 or a\u0302\u0080\u009818. And we said that this is the inevitable and a trend. You had to go move to 48 volt. And we are now in the forefront of, and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re not replacing anybody, okay? We set up this market trend. And so a\u0302\u0080\u0093 and also in the data center and the rack itself is a big opportunities and MPS are ramping revenue from there, to from the AC power, and these are 380 volts and I guess, 240 volts input convert into 48 volt. And also the battery backup, and we provide the same a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we provide the solutions for battery management and also cooling side. And so MPS is almost one-stop shopping place for data center. Well, these are one thing, right? We do a\u0302\u0080\u0093 of course, we have the fab, we have the mobile. And we will have increased more capacities outside of China. We started about a couple of years ago, also more than a couple of years ago. And now we engage with some bigger DRAM fabs, okay? We will fill that up in the next couple of years. And a\u0302\u0080\u0093 but going to futures, MPS actually require less semiconductors and because a lot of products are more programmable and we can use for multiple use. And at the same time, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re growing our revenues. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re selling a lot more than semiconductor. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re selling power solutions, more modules. And a\u0302\u0080\u0093 so we kind of move up the food chain as the new requirement comes in, we play in the market, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re not competing with anybody. And we just provide the solutions. And so those are manufacturer. These are clearly a\u0302\u0080\u0093 they are different. They are building modules. And we sign up partnerships, okay, for assemble these new modules. And ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s unprecedented. And a lot of testings, a lot of qualifications, MPS designed the whole system from a ground up. And so these are the a\u0302\u0080\u0093 there is no such a facility out there. So we had to invent it, that work. But these are a\u0302\u0080\u0093 the bigger effect hasna\u0302\u0080\u0099t really taken place yet. That would be a couple a\u0302\u0080\u0093 a year or a couple of years down the road, you will see much bigger effect and a\u0302\u0080\u0093 so there is a lot of the new a\u0302\u0080\u0093 a lot of work to do ahead of us. And these are a\u0302\u0080\u0093 particularly, these are new types of modules. Nobody else build the kind of things, okay? Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re ground up, we developed and we even develop a manufacturing and as well as testing the qualifications part of it. Gaining share, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a\u0302\u0080\u0093 gaining share is a difficult to count because gaining share, if the equals product is gaining share and going to be in a similar product. And a\u0302\u0080\u0093 so you a\u0302\u0080\u0093 our price betters, our performance better, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re gaining shares. Okay. Now wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re talking about completely different things. And those market segments we want to get in there is less price sensitive, but quality, performance a lot more important. And now okay, we offer something that is a lot more than that. And 10 years ago, we said who do we compete with? And not a company sell controller and power MOSFET, they are separate, MPS is integrated. And now youa\u0302\u0080\u0099re talking about MPS, we a\u0302\u0080\u0093 our product even on the silicon side. And we have microcontroller, we have a memory, we have digital, we have power. And very unique how we a\u0302\u0080\u0093 what we a\u0302\u0080\u0093 who do we display. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s difficult to say it. Now ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s getting to use these type of silicon-based technology, we migrate out. We became a provider of total solutions. So how do we a\u0302\u0080\u0093 who do we display, and okay, how we gain market share? Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s very difficult to say. Thank you. Yes. I think what you said partially is correct. I mean the other company couldna\u0302\u0080\u0099t ship, okay, we have the inventories and again, we have a capacity to ship. But this year, particularly, we see things are very different. And a lot of products, especially we ship to these Tier 1 companies are from the industrial side, from automotive side and even the data centers. And they dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t a\u0302\u0080\u0093 they didna\u0302\u0080\u0099t intend to have MPS has a big a\u0302\u0080\u0093 has a majority as a bigger supplier, where they give us as a backup and to test a lot. And in the last years, we shipped all these units, our failures, okay. We are far better than everybody else, and thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s one thing. The quality of a\u0302\u0080\u0093 quality is everything. And a\u0302\u0080\u0093 but they took a chance when they have shortages. And so we proved that, give us a bigger opportunity. We proved it, these products as better. Okay, as good as better than our a\u0302\u0080\u0093 whatever the parts they design them out. And in the last year, this year, all the new product or the new segment start to grow out. And as our product, we can change it, we can reconfigure it. And that will continue, we continue to grow up. And as we see it at, we cannot handle all the projects. And so in the foreseeable features and these products will continue to grow. Yes. I will come back to your questions. Okay. Now you said that you are growing a large basis, so you grow, okay, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s difficult to grow. Thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s kind of a built in everybodya\u0302\u0080\u0099s mind, okay? In my mind, I dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t have a limit. And the limit is within yourself, what to do. And people told me, okay, early on $200 million, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s your barriers, like $500 million of barriers. $200 million at the time, it was a barrier at one time. It happened. And $500 million, it wasna\u0302\u0080\u0099t okay, then people tell me, okay, you are going to grow $1 billion, you need to slowdown. And at the time seriously, that was 2017, 2017 or a\u0302\u0080\u009818, yes, a\u0302\u0080\u009817, I actually said it, okay, when we get to $1 billion, we are going to accelerate it. And thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s at the time, thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s how I see it. And now, okay, MPS, we are not selling silicon anymore. We are selling raw more than the silicon, and why not accelerating the growth. So, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a\u0302\u0080\u0093 of course, I am not saying that now okay, a lot of things still depend on our execution. But only thing is the mindset when not dwell on selling semiconductors. And selling semiconductor is limited, but you have a lot of service engineering manpower, we can a\u0302\u0080\u0093 our customers can benefit to it. Thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s not a\u0302\u0080\u0093 thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s unlimited almost. Yes. Thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s kind of things we are going to a\u0302\u0080\u0093 of course I can all I will say, okay, we can charge as much as our customers available, okay. And thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s kind of a half BS , okay. And a\u0302\u0080\u0093 but the reality is I think that we are comfortably stay around this mid to high-50s and 55% to 60% in the range. I think thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s a sweet spot for us. We are not going to print the corners for us to grow to over 70%. And when we get that, we get that, okay. So far, we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t have headwinds. And I think the opportunity drives the model itself. In the next couple of years, I think that we are going to stay around this as we are now. So, maybe move up a slide later. I mean we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t have a\u0302\u0080\u0093 at least we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t have the headwinds. And so after 3 years or 4 years we will see how we change our models. We are not chasing the volumes going down. We are not actually MPS is not good at chasing our volume. We are not doing these manufacturing, okay. Actually, MPS doesna\u0302\u0080\u0099t manufacture anything and the high-volume things, thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s not MPS forte. Yes. Yes. Look, I mean we a\u0302\u0080\u0093 and as a matter of fact, the form of MPS, from the beginning, so we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t sell pin-to-pin comparables, okay. We a\u0302\u0080\u0093 in a similar product, we offer the a\u0302\u0080\u0093 actually, we are always a far better product. And much compact, much higher efficiencies. And as an also cost to play without the armor charge on the late and that is known for MPS, okay, and a one-time ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s early period of time, the MPS is like a price, kind of companies. And we actually a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we didna\u0302\u0080\u0099t, that means that we left a little lot of dollars on the table. And of course, we are not competing in that market segment anymore. Now okay, we offer either total solutions. And if you do a\u0302\u0080\u0093 if you are mentioning up a\u0302\u0080\u0093 if you are talking about any applications, they need power. And we are talking about electrical car, MPS can build a whole car and use electronics. And you want to build the data centers, MPS provides the entire product for data centers, and we are mostly there. And thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s how we sell value. And we are not competing on this product competes with that product. We have all software behind it. And we have user interface, okay, software that changes the game. We are not competing with the product per se anymore. As you see a\u0302\u0080\u0093 as you remember, MPS like 4 years ago, we actually built a car. Built a very advanced car and far advanced than any car that you see in the market. And with battery management and same time, all the motor controls, a lot more complex than the existing EV. And so just for the purpose, we can demonstrate we can do it. And now we can do it a\u0302\u0080\u0093 and 4 years later, actually, we can do a lot more than that. And so thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s kind of examples. Yes, as we see it. And okay, as we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t want to a\u0302\u0080\u0093 okay, what will we provide, not customer asked for it? Yes, we will do that, a customer do that. We should lead to customers. So, what you should need. Thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s the game we are really playing, okay. We are playing ahead of game. And I think that all the power stuff like 48 volts, we said that this is like a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we said that in 2017, okay, this is the futures, and we anticipated that. Electrical cars, we anticipated that. And so now we can, in the next few years, and we will see the very similar things that we will see all of these will happen."

Please note that this webinar is being recorded and will be archived for one year on our Investor Relations page at www.monolithicpower.com. My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar. Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO.  In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risks and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the safe harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on February 25, 2022, which is accessible through our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call.  We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our Q1 2022 earnings release, which we have furnished to the SEC and is currently available on our website.  I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for 1 year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie.\nBernie Blegen: Thanks, Gen. MPS posted record first quarter revenue of $377.7 million, 48.4% higher than the first quarter of 2021. The year-over-year revenue increase represented strength in the overall market and more importantly broad-based market share gains, resulting from customer acceptance of our new product introductions.  Before looking at our revenue by market, I would like to call your attention to a change in our reporting. In order to provide increased visibility on data center and cloud computing revenue, a growth reporting for computer and storage to get 2 separate line items. The table has been included in this webinar showing the company's quarterly revenue on this basis since 2017. The first line item is called storage and computing, which primarily refers to total storage and client computing revenue. The second line item is called enterprise data, which captures revenue from data center and product.  In our storage and computing market, first quarter 2022 revenue of $96.6 million increased $18.6 million or 23.9% from the fourth quarter of 2021 due primarily to higher storage and commercial notebook sales. Computing -- storage and computing revenue represented 25.6% of MPS' first quarter 2022 revenue compared with 20.2% in the first quarter of 2021.  In our enterprise data market, first quarter 2022 revenue of $42.5 million increased 5.0% in the fourth quarter of 2021 due primarily to continuing strength in data center and workstation computing sales. Enterprise data revenue represented 11.3% of MPS' first quarter 2022 revenue compared with 6.4% in the first quarter of 2021.  First quarter 2022 communications revenue of $55.6 million rose $9.7 million or 21.1% for the fourth quarter of 2021. The quarter-over-quarter increase primarily reflected higher revenue related to 5G build-outs and satellite communications. Communications revenue represented 14.7% of MPS' first quarter 2022 revenue compared with 14.2% in the first quarter of 2021.  First quarter 2022 revenue from consumer markets of $80.0 million increased $13.6 million or 20.6% from the fourth quarter of 2021. This sequential quarterly improvement of the sequential revenue increase reflected a broad-based increase particularly related to our IoT business. Consumer revenue represented 21.2% of our Q1 revenue compared with a 26.0% contribution in the first quarter of 2021.  First quarter 2022 unearned revenue of $54.5 million decreased 3.2% from the fourth quarter of 2021. Unearned revenue represented 14.4% of MPS' first quarter 2022 revenue compared with 17.6% in the previous year.  In our industrial market, revenue of $48.5 million was essentially flat with revenue recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. Industrial revenue represented 12.8% of our first quarter revenue compared with 15.6% in the prior year.  Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 57.9%, 30 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2021 and 250 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2021. Our GAAP operating income was $96.1 million compared with $78.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the first quarter of 2022, non-GAAP gross margin was 58.3%, 40 basis points better in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 250 basis points better than the first quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP operating income was $133.6 million compared to $112.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021.  On both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, the sequential quarterly gross margin improvement was primarily due to a better product mix as revenue from higher value, new product introductions are ramping.  Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $122.7 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared with $115.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2022 operating expenses were $86.6 million, up from $83.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangibles and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan.  For the first quarter of 2022, compensation expense, including approximately $1.3 million charged to cost of goods sold was $39.8 million compared with $31.2 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Switching to bottom line. First quarter 2022 GAAP net income was $79.6 million or $1.65 per fully diluted share compared to $72.7 million or $1.51 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. First quarter 2022 non-GAAP net income was $118.3 million or $2.45 per fully diluted share compared with $102.1 million or $2.12 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2021. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q1 2022 were 48.2 million.  Let's look of the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $775.1 million at the end of the first quarter of 2022 compared to $727.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $107.4 million compared with operating cash flow of $28.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. First quarter 2022 capital spending totaled $26.5 million.  Accounts receivable ended the first quarter of 2022 at $120.3 million or 29 days of sales outstanding, up 1 day from 28 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter of 2020 were $311.0 million, up from the $259.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. Days of inventory increased to 178 days at the end of Q1 2022 compared with 166 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021.  Historically, we calculated days inventory on hand as a function of current quarter revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's projected revenue provides a better economic . On this basis, again, as you can see, days of inventory increased to 159 days at the end of the first quarter of 2022, up from 149 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021.  I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2022. We are forecasting Q2 revenue to remain of $420 million to $440 million. We also expect to follow -- at gross margin in the range of 58.4% to 59.4%, non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 58.7% to 59.3%, GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $132.7 million and $136.7 million, non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $90.0 million to $92.0 million. This doesn't exclude stock compensation and litigation expenses.  Total stock-based compensation expense of $44.2 million to $46.2 million, including approximately $1.5 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold, litigation expenses ranging between $2.3 million and $2.7 million. Interest and other income is expected to range from $1.3 million to $1.7 million before foreign exchange gains or losses, fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.8 million to 48.8 million shares.  In conclusion, we will continue to execute on our long-term plan for sustainable growth. I will now open the webinar up for questions.\nA - Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie, analysts. I would now like to begin our Q&A session. . Our first question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank.\nBernie Blegen: Ross is not there. Perhaps we can move on.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Alex Vechhi of William Blair.\nAlex Vecchi: Congratulations on a great quarter in a tough environment. Maybe you can address a little bit the supply constraints in some of the China COVID impact. It seems like you guys came out from that completely unscathed, be interested in some of the dynamics that's allowed you to do that.\nMichael Hsing: Well, Alex, we plan this kind of ramp not from last year from -- not from this year last year, many years ago. And as you remember, in 2017, even '16, we said that we're going to on greenfield products will grow and exactly we don't know at plus or minus a year or so. And so we plan every aspect, including logistics and staff, assembly house and our internal testing. And this is not a 1-year thing. We planned a long time ago. And now when the revenues rent is a little better than we anticipated. And so that's where you see the result.\nBernie Blegen: And if I can add to that, we've also built inventories so that in 178 days, we're just at the lower end of our goal of being between 180 and 200 days, which provides us a good insurance policy as we look ahead to achieving our numbers for the second half of the year.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, even the end of the second half of 2019 in -- the business is not as great, but we built according to our plan, and we know the business will come. Our -- at that time, I remember, our inventory is over 200 days. And that part of it, inventories made us -- our customers feel a lot more long more reliable, like MPS as a major player.\nAlex Vecchi: Okay. That's really helpful. And then maybe one for you, Bernie, just on gross margin. Margins have been very strong, as I believe. You've alluded to product mix. Just on that front, how much more runway do you think you have on the gross margin front from the uplift on sort of your new products going forward?\nBernie Blegen: Sure. As you've seen both in the results that we had for Q1, along with our guidance for Q2, which positions us around 59% gross margin, I think we've done a fair job of -- digesting is the incorrect word, but acknowledging the uplift in our margins as a result of our product mix. So again, I'll give the same answer I did last time that we believe that we've created a new floor gross margins once we can expand 10 to 20 basis points sequentially. But again, if opportunistically, we see a back set, which allows us to take it up another, we will be happy to take that.  I want to emphasize that, well, most of our peer companies have benefited both in terms of revenue growth and margin expansion from price increases, Ours has been driven primarily by the change in revenue mix, which is favoring these higher-value products. And it was only in February of this year we did a broad-based increase of our prices but that was still far below what the market has seen.\nMichael Hsing: Just a pass on the cost to our customers. And as the margin expansion for our case, we said earlier, okay, setting in 2017 or '18, we don't have a headwind in -- by 2019. The, market slowed down a little bit and we built up a lot of some amortizations that -- in a production pipeline. So our margin went slightly lower, but it's not much lower. And now and you see this margin continued to grow.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen.\nMatthew Ramsay: Can you guys hear me all right?\nMichael Hsing: Yes.\nMatthew Ramsay: Michael, I guess, for either one of you guys, it was interesting that you're breaking out sort of the data center piece from the PC and storage business. And I guess I wonder a couple of things about that, like what may be you our guys are trying to signal by breaking those out separately, in particular the new enterprise data segment is up, I don't know, 160% year-over-year, but that's really before the 2 primary server processor vendors launched with new sockets this year. So Michael, could you maybe talk a little bit about the reason for breaking that out and the relative growth rates you guys expect of these 2 new segments as we go forward?\nMichael Hsing: If you combine all together, it's a kind of -- we're going to answer -- in the past, we answered those questions anyway and -- but when we reported on some numbers, and so which is more clear and publish you guys know it, have a less meaningful questions and any other reasons.\nBernie Blegen: I think, Matt, you did a good job of saying that this is clearly an inflection point for us, inflection year which will gain momentum as we see both Intel and AMD position for product releases are coming up here. So that, in addition to the expanding footprint we have in both 48-volt and artificial intelligence, we believe that this will be one of our areas for sustainable growth for certainly next 3 to 5 years. And exactly as Michael said, we believe that providing better transparency is definitely a better information for our investors.\nMatthew Ramsay: Thanks to both for that. That's helpful. I guess if you look at the second quarter guidance that you provided, $430 million at the midpoint was quite a bit above where consensus was and certainly where my model was. Bernie, if you might take a second to walk us through by segment, how you're thinking about the growth being concentrated, that would be really helpful.\nBernie Blegen: I think that on a dollar or percent basis, we're going to see an accelerating ramp in enterprise, particularly during the second half of the year. I think we're going to see continued growth in our storage and computing albeit probably not at the same rate. Part of the reason for that is that storage tends to be a precursor at least from our experience to a data center ramp. So I think in each of the 2 prior quarters, we've seen a good, strong ramp in storage, and now we're expecting 2 to 3 quarters in the data center.  In the rest of the business, communications, as we said, we've broadened into not only 5G but also into satellite communications. And that's going to continue to be a driver for the foreseeable future. In the other areas, obviously, consumer, that is coming along, we emphasized Internet of Things but we -- actually, the growth there is broad-based.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham.\nNathaniel Bolton: Let me offer my congratulations as well. I wanted to come back to Alex' question about China. Obviously, you source most of your assembly and wafer capacity in China. And I just -- given the zero COVID policy in China and some of the resulting lockdowns, are you rethinking the need to diversify outside of China either on the assembly and test or assembly and wafer foundry side? And then I guess, a related question, I think most of your final test takes place in Chengdu, have you any contingency plans in place in case Chengdu is put under lockdown due to COVID?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. We started a couple of years ago. We already started doing so. And as you know that China and manufacturing in Asia is the center of the work, and we can't debate too much or not if they have a serious problems, I think everybody worry about it, even the bigger things. And yes -- the answer is yes, okay. We already started and establish in a different clinical environment.\nNathaniel Bolton: In Chengdu, Michael, do you have test capacity outside of Chengdu, if Chengdu goes under lockdown?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. As we're starting to about a couple of years ago, but maybe it's a little more than 12 months ago, we're starting.\nBernie Blegen: With the testing capacity in Chengdu. We've concentrated that on some of our higher value parts including automotive. And now as Michael just said is now we've started transition where we can actually have third parties. So we actually have a built-in contingency plan.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, outside Chengdu only, yes, we have -- other than these high reliability product in retesting in our side. And other than that, okay, we do pretty high volumes if it's about half of it. It's in a different facility. When I talk about -- I just mentioned about it is outside China.\nNathaniel Bolton: Got it. Okay. And then my follow-up question is around the internal inventory level that you guys have done an absolutely fantastic job of increasing that in a very tight supply environment. I guess my question is, as you're approaching now the low end of your target range of 180 to 200 days, can you tell us what's going on with lead times? I would think as internal inventories get up to your target level, that may give you the ability to start to reduce lead times to potentially gain even more market share. But wondering if you could give us a sense of what's going on with lead times given that increase in internal inventory levels.\nMichael Hsing: Our lead time is in this quarter is the same as the last quarter. So probably even our booking even -- I don't see anything. The rate of our booking is now reduced and Bernie, you said.\nBernie Blegen: And you took my answer on both ones that lead times have remained very consistent each in the last 3 quarters. And again, what you're seeing as far as the build of inventories has been a very conscious and deliberate decision to build the inventories in advance, particularly on the enterprise side, to meet the demand we expect for the second half of the year. And then I think that we've done a good job of positioning ourselves under what has now become uncertain environment.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist.\nWilliam Stein: Congrats on the very strong results, especially the outlook. We understand though that while we see a great number overall, in particular for the guidance, there's always moving parts when we look at it on a more detailed level. And I wonder if you're seeing either perhaps owing to customers focusing on getting balanced kits or full sets or however you want to call it or if you're seeing anything related to Ukraine or the lockdowns in China, whether any of these factors is influencing either the order rates or the backlog. For example, if none of these things were happening, the outlook would have been even stronger. Any qualification you can provide us would be helpful.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Well, MPS is like selling . And we are not a dominant application supply. We got something in a. -- I mean so whatever we ship is that these are the small part of the solutions. And so we don't know, okay? That's -- actually, that's our model. That's a billion. We don't know where these costs -- and so whether the wall effectiveness, okay, and we're very, very much diversified. We actually don't know it. And okay, they call you there.  So the -- to answer your questions, I mean, only things, yes, we do know where the product was the data centers. The product if it goes to a car, mean these are we're pretty much not a lot where the product ended up, okay. And other than that, we don't.\nBernie Blegen: Just reinforcing the answer from before, there is no significant KPI, whether it's in the bookings or any other area of our business that we're seeing a change over the past 2, 3 quarters. That's helpful.\nWilliam Stein: Bernie, you've talked about various levels of revenue that you could achieve at full utilization. In other words, the capacity that you're building for. I know they started couple of years ago. Well, I'm sure it's ongoing really. But the capacity and the upside that we've seen over the last few quarters, of course, those were not planned very quickly. They were planned a long time ago. Can you remind us or maybe update us on the medium to long-term capacity planning that's in place today? What levels of total capacity we can expect over the next few quarters?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. That's a good question. I think that we answered the questions in last quarter, okay, we said that we're going to play in the $4 billion of revenues in the next couple of years. And so that's what we do and we continue to invest.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. And I think just to sort of lend some credibility to that, you recall about a year ago, that we offer by the end of Q2, in 2022, that would be at a $2 billion run rate. And with the guide that we have provided and the expectations ahead, I think that's a milestone that backs up the amount of visibility in our supply chain. So right now, the goal as Michael said, $4 billion.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. If the demand is there in this year, we will do it, yes. What will do $2 billion, as we said in a couple of years ago. And we continue to see the demand in, and we see the demand will be there. Okay. This is not a one -- a short term, okay, things. And if it does not happen that year, that will happen the year after.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer.\nRichard Schafer: I'll echo all the congratulations on other stellar quarter for you guys and outlook. If I could, my first question, I'm just kind of following up on the server breakout and obviously, a big ramp ahead for QSMod and cloud this year. I was curious kind of below that line a little bit, if there's any updates you could give us, like your 48 volt expectations this year or next?  And within that, I'm curious, I sort of assumed 48 volts virtually all AI accelerator for the next couple of years. But I'm curious when you see 48-volt sort of move into other areas like CPU or some broader markets like auto or industrial because I'm curious if you've looked at sort of what that 48-volt SAM looks like for MPS because it seems like an awful big opportunity.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. 48 volts actually started in the automotive and also the silver and AI, okay, these CPUs. And for the 48 volts for the car, that's a different thing. but the same technologies. And also, we see these telecom areas, 48 volts, it's all standard and -- so now the 4Gs and the compliance with the 48 volts, again, we have a solution there. So there's a lot of areas we can grow.\nBernie Blegen: And I think that the 48 Volt, not only are we seeing the ramp, its adoption more broadly, but competitively, I would offer that we're very well positioned with some of the new technologies that we've rolled out and expect to roll out during the course of the next 18 months. So I think here again, we time our product releases pretty well with the inflection of this market opportunity.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. And as we're talking with the product, the module is ramping, yes. So we provide -- we're providing whatever customer needs. We had a chip level on module level or solution levels.\nRichard Schafer: Okay. And then maybe as my follow-up, just on 5G, I haven't asked the 5G question in a while. I mean you guys are engaged with the sort of the big 3 Tier 1 OEMs. And I just was curious if you can give us an update on your expectations. I know you flagged 5G here from 1Q results. So I'm curious what your expectations are for this year. And if there's any update you could give us on sort of how content compares with what you're seeing in server or data center and sort of how that ramp looks. And maybe if you could talk about how you quantify that opportunity in macro base station.\nBernie Blegen: The 5G is a relatively new market segment for us. So it's not like we can draw from our prior experience and calibrated up or down. We're sort of living a little hand to mouth on what demand looks like and how fast we're shipping. So we don't have a real good predictive model. What we talked to you about in the past has been that, again, we believe on a broad base, not only with as you referred to the top 3 but with a number of partners related to 5G infrastructure, we're providing content.  And while it's easy to look at the base station as a means of calculating out what the SAM is available to us. I think that we're also in fiber optic in the data center support for 5G as well as in the transceiver of the base station. And again, I think, as we pointed out, a lot of the initial technology that we're putting in is tending to be lower end and not necessarily specialized or adapted to 5G specifically.  So we don't have the same level of visibility on how it's being deployed, and we've used this strategy in the past with data center. We comment with lower dollar value content, build the relationships and then we're able to go to higher value content.\nMichael Hsing: Let me say that we do have a custom design for each of the areas that Bernie said from fiber optics to all the single chain, all the way to transmitters. And we do have a customer design. And based on our standard product modules -- and these are the products. It's not really a low end. It can be, but these products can be used for any other telecom, which provide a building market, it provide power solutions for each of these blocks -- each of these categories. And we do see a lot of activity now in the revenues is ramping now.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Chris Caso of Raymond James.\nChristopher Caso: I guess a question about the profile of revenue growth as we go through the year. And thus far, over the past several quarters, your revenue growth has been pretty broadly based, seeing growth in most segments. I know we've been speaking about and we've been anticipating for a while the server ramp as we get to the end of the year. But as we look through revenue in the next kind of 2, 3, 4 quarters, do you expect that revenue growth to continue to be broadly based, where you think this is going to be concentrated in any particular segments?\nMichael Hsing: Well, the strategy is we're fired as many cylinders we can, okay? Whenever it grows, we grow, okay? And I think that's the strength among the diversifications. And in the next few quarters, we see the demand even for 2023 and '24, and these are pretty much similar, okay? We don't see that much of a difference.  And one thing we see it, okay, they -- we -- our customers demand more high-value product, which means they can easily adopt in ease of use and a much higher efficiency product and an energy using efficiency product. And so these are much better for us. Instead of our customer do lot development work, we do a lot of development work for our -- we develop the solution for our customers. So that means a higher dollar amount -- a higher dollar content. And so that's really we see that as only difference.\nChristopher Caso: Got it. My follow-up question is about the impact of some of the China lockdowns and not from your production side but rather from your customer side. And what we heard from some others or at least one other is that part of the challenges in China right now are customers having facilities that are closed or that freight forwarders simply unwilling to accept product because of some of the logistics challenges that are going on right now. Is that something you're facing as well? And is there any impact on your revenue right now, which might mean some of those issues get solved, that some of that goes into the second half of the year?\nMichael Hsing: Absolutely hit us. And don't get me wrong. Even though we grow this much, if we were not that problem, so we ship a whole lot more but we just have -- we anticipated that a little better. So we can still roll in our -- one of our models, can mean there's not much of our model. And for the portion is above our model, even a year, 2 years and again.  And on the other hand, in -- other than our logistics and production limitations, our customers, they have a mix, too. And clearly, you see the auto business. I mean we have less problem of shipping product than other suppliers. So -- and you can't speculate in okay, because of in limited or -- they are buying -- they're purchasing of our product and for because they miss other parts.\nBernie Blegen: And I think that we continue to be very resilient under a number of environmental circumstances. Part of that is the planning that we've set 3, 4 years ago, and some of it is how diversified long is and some of it is how adaptive we can be in the moment. So again, we did acknowledge the impact our customer supply chain affecting us, but I wouldn't say that, that is a pronounced element and we're continuing to monitor it.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel Nicolaus.\nTore Svanberg: Congratulations on another record quarter, quite stunning. First question is on long-term growth. So you grew more than 40% last year. It looks like you're on track to growing another 40% this year at least. Michael, in the past, you've said there's no reason why you can't accelerate growth even though you have higher revenues.\nMichael Hsing: You remember that. That's good.\nTore Svanberg: So I'm just trying to understand what you think about long-term growth at this point. Is 40% the right number? I know you're probably not going to commit to a number, but yes, anything you can add on that would be great.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Okay, as always said, okay, about a few minutes ago, I said that our customers even demands the more higher value product, can be in a solution kind of related products, not they wanted a low their engineering effort to MPS. And I see that opportunity is the opportunities for accelerated growth because think about it, if it's MPS, we don't make any and we're just only testing the final control -- quality control.  And that can apply to anything else. And I apply to models, apply tools okay, applied to any other solutions at all, but it's all related to power all related to OEM. And so from now on, you will see MPS, okay, we provide plug-and-play solution for all kind of robotics, for industrial automation and for building controls. And those type of product and -- which has a lot higher ASPs, we buy those components or we specify those components and we incorporate to our solutions. So the unit price will be much higher.  And now it's how fast we can put all these solutions together and turn it into a meaningful revenue. And that, I can't predict. And then you have that product, a lot of knowledges too. Now at the same time, MPS is a semiconductor chip business, keep growing. So I don't see in the near term in the next year or so. I don't see any slowdown, and it's actually accelerated.  And so to the other model is at the very infancies. And if you go 3 or 4, 5 years from now, I think as we will be real solution companies like silicon semiconductor is only a part of it out in the total content. So I want to grow more. I've seen more than $10 billion of companies, I mean $10 billion, $15 billion company, and there is no reason why not?\nTore Svanberg: That's great perspective, Michael. As my follow-up, I wasn't aware you had a lot of traction in the sat comm market. I was just hoping you could add a little bit more color there, what types of applications, what are some of the strengths the company has today in that market. And are you continuing to introduce new products? Because that's -- to me, it's obviously a very high-margin business, right, but it's also a very difficult market to crack into.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. It's or committed to sell our communications and not only in the cell like self the grand station there's a huge amount. There's new standards, and again, there's a lot of new activities in that. And we designed it into a few years ago. And mostly, it's a power modules. And also, we have related to these in the cell and I mean this a controlled the solar panels and also a lot of power box. And I think the value in this is so -- this is everywhere, okay -- and these are for antenna to powering up the antenna to power the receivers and also all the way down to the user interface, and we all benefit from.\nTore Svanberg: Excellent. Very good. Congratulations again.\nMichael Hsing: Thank you.\nBernie Blegen: Thanks.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Seymore: Can you guys hear me this time?\nMichael Hsing: Yes, Ross, you're there.\nRoss Seymore: I've been here the whole time. I'm glad that we got it to work. So I guess the first question is a longer-term one, then I'll follow up with a shorter-term one. Michael, you talked many times on tonight's call about moving up the value chain, adding more value. Customers want to use Monolithic for more and more. And in the past, that's going from kind of the second or third tier folks in various markets up to the first tier. So really what I want to get at is, are you seeing evidence of moving up to higher and higher value customers? And does the fact that you didn't raise prices as much as your peers and that you had availability, is that giving you longer-term design wins, higher value design wins? Anything you could do to quantify that dynamic?\nMichael Hsing: I don't know how to qualify that, okay, because we don't -- we didn't really -- we didn't increase the price, okay, for those customers the first tier, the value the strategic customers because this prices are negotiated way before that. And we have the audit. And so we always said what we do. It's what we said what we do, okay? So we have to honor that.  And I think that also is a part of MPS branding and so that benefits the for long term. And for other high-value customers or high-value products and it's sporadic. This is the very beginning, a lot of customers don't even know or you offer these solutions but you offer that the entire solutions and -- so they don't even know that, okay. MPS is just starting to. And that actually relates to a few years ago, we said that we're going to do e-commerce, okay? We do e-commerce plug-and-play, programmable, all these things. And these are all related.  And so we do solar only for large customers, and I said we're a satellite company. We have the EV companies. We have a day 1 MPS, do a lot more or even the data centers and the demand of all these, we provide the entire unit. And they don't have to design it. So that's actually a across the board. I just named a few. But revenue is still small. We're starting.\nRoss Seymore: And for my follow-up, a near-term question, Bernie, this could either be both revenues and/or the gross margin and your answer on this, and it's really about the mix. You've talked about the gross margin rising because of mix and new products being the driver of that. So if I look at the industrial and automotive businesses, the last couple of quarters, they're great year-over-year, but they've been flat to a little bit down sequentially for the last 6 months or so. Is there anything going on in that business? Is it just lumpiness? Is it waiting for some design wins?  And on the mix side of that equation for gross margin, I think most people believe those could be some of the more accretive areas. So how is the mix such a positive for your gross margin if the 2 areas that are supposed to be the highest margins are actually slightly underperforming the others?\nMichael Hsing: Makes sense. That was good question.\nBernie Blegen: Let me reference wehat Michael said earlier. It's the power of our model of diversification of the end markets. And if you go back to the performance, the revenue performance that we demonstrated in industrial and automotive last year, they were leaders in our growth drivers. In the current year and reflected what's the health of the 2 end markets, it really came down to it being the timing of shipments.  So we believe that as far as the design rules that are coming in, that we don't believe that we overshipped them to the extent that that's going to cause us a problem. The orders on the book remained incredibly positive. So again, it's just -- it's more different to quarter-over-quarter as opposed to anything fundamentally different about the market.\nMichael Hsing: And also, one of the questions is why the margin goes up and if these are 2 segments go sideways, okay? I mean the year-to-year -- year-over-year growth, I mean, if you look at it from a Q3 last year to now, those segments -- that contributes a lot of margins, okay, gross margins.  And the other segments, like consumers, I mean we phased out and there can be this not on the last year. So maybe the year, beginning of the last year. When the capacity gets issues, as you know, we always phase out these lower margin. That's another part of it. And -- but overall, the greenfield products drive the margins.\nBernie Blegen: And just to add to Michael's point, as far as phasing out lower margin business, we're trying to rationalize our wafer starts to capture the largest opportunity. And as a result, some of the lower-margin business that we would have used to have in our portfolio, we haven't emphasized that in our production planning. It's just not there as a component of our business like it has been historically.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt.\nHans Mosesmann: Congratulations, like everybody else has mentioned. Good stuff. I have 2 questions. Michael, if we were to split 48 volts as an opportunity. So I'm thinking it getting 48 volts to the rack in your data center and within the rack, getting that 48 volts to the board and every board has to deal with the accelerators and there's power issues there. So there's 3 touch points. If that's the way to look at it, what is the opportunity for each? And where would you be seeing the first incremental business for 48 volts for MPS?\nMichael Hsing: I think it's the solution, yes, you're right, okay? And then now the question is does depend on applications, 48 volts, down to 12 volts, down to directly to 1.2 volts. That's at the last part, okay, we don't do that and our customers -- and there's the few providers of the solution is not come -- and so we play in the market. I mean it's not to 12, 48 convert to 12 and convert 5 -- 4 or 5 volts, okay? That's the market we played. We came in and it's open builder materials. Everybody else can jump into it. And we -- so our competitor provides a similar solution.  And so that kind of -- we know this is the application, but which one, we don't know. Which one is hard to tell. All these high current products, and you probably know more than I do, okay, goes to 600 watt to 1,000 watts and even some of the couple of 1,000 watts. You see these are all MPS solutions now and these are -- the higher wattage you go, the volts get smaller.  And so in the coming years and those accelerate the costs, okay, the population in the data centers. And that's where you see it. These are 48 volts that convert to 12. And then you have a new solutions that we provide so you can to a firewall. So okay, an increase close to 1% of efficiency, which is a lot.\nHans Mosesmann: That was very helpful, Michael. My follow-on, just to end this, what is the view of the PC market for MPS? I think Intel mentioned that the low end of the PC market is weak, but the other parts are okay. What's your view to the degree that you have participation there?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. We obviously -- okay, and we do well. And we do PCs and case PC, the commercial PCs, that even the low end of business from OEs. And -- but for us, it's a very opportunistic because we have a product developed for server. And without much of an engineering effort, we can spin off to do other products. We did a product for commercial PC and for commercial norms.  And on the other end, we do battery management. We do actually panel. And -- pretty much, we can offer an mobile solutions other than memories, other than the CPUs. And so that's -- it's very opportunistic. And we -- currently, we see the demand is very strong.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. And just to add to that, Michael, is we have a very good footprint in the commercial side. And because we have so many different client offerings, what we're seeing is being able to sell additional content into those same platforms.\nGenevieve Cunningham: . As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.\nBernie Blegen: Great. Thanks, Gen. I'd like to thank you all for joining us on the Q1 2022 earnings webinar. I look forward to talking to you again during our second quarter conference call, which we would like to be in July. Thank you, and have a nice day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bernie Blegen",
            "content": "Thanks, Gen. MPS posted record first quarter revenue of $377.7 million, 48.4% higher than the first quarter of 2021. The year-over-year revenue increase represented strength in the overall market and more importantly broad-based market share gains, resulting from customer acceptance of our new product introductions.  Before looking at our revenue by market, I would like to call your attention to a change in our reporting. In order to provide increased visibility on data center and cloud computing revenue, a growth reporting for computer and storage to get 2 separate line items. The table has been included in this webinar showing the company's quarterly revenue on this basis since 2017. The first line item is called storage and computing, which primarily refers to total storage and client computing revenue. The second line item is called enterprise data, which captures revenue from data center and product.  In our storage and computing market, first quarter 2022 revenue of $96.6 million increased $18.6 million or 23.9% from the fourth quarter of 2021 due primarily to higher storage and commercial notebook sales. Computing -- storage and computing revenue represented 25.6% of MPS' first quarter 2022 revenue compared with 20.2% in the first quarter of 2021.  In our enterprise data market, first quarter 2022 revenue of $42.5 million increased 5.0% in the fourth quarter of 2021 due primarily to continuing strength in data center and workstation computing sales. Enterprise data revenue represented 11.3% of MPS' first quarter 2022 revenue compared with 6.4% in the first quarter of 2021.  First quarter 2022 communications revenue of $55.6 million rose $9.7 million or 21.1% for the fourth quarter of 2021. The quarter-over-quarter increase primarily reflected higher revenue related to 5G build-outs and satellite communications. Communications revenue represented 14.7% of MPS' first quarter 2022 revenue compared with 14.2% in the first quarter of 2021.  First quarter 2022 revenue from consumer markets of $80.0 million increased $13.6 million or 20.6% from the fourth quarter of 2021. This sequential quarterly improvement of the sequential revenue increase reflected a broad-based increase particularly related to our IoT business. Consumer revenue represented 21.2% of our Q1 revenue compared with a 26.0% contribution in the first quarter of 2021.  First quarter 2022 unearned revenue of $54.5 million decreased 3.2% from the fourth quarter of 2021. Unearned revenue represented 14.4% of MPS' first quarter 2022 revenue compared with 17.6% in the previous year.  In our industrial market, revenue of $48.5 million was essentially flat with revenue recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. Industrial revenue represented 12.8% of our first quarter revenue compared with 15.6% in the prior year.  Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 57.9%, 30 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2021 and 250 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2021. Our GAAP operating income was $96.1 million compared with $78.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the first quarter of 2022, non-GAAP gross margin was 58.3%, 40 basis points better in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 250 basis points better than the first quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP operating income was $133.6 million compared to $112.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021.  On both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, the sequential quarterly gross margin improvement was primarily due to a better product mix as revenue from higher value, new product introductions are ramping.  Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $122.7 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared with $115.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2022 operating expenses were $86.6 million, up from $83.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are stock compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangibles and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan.  For the first quarter of 2022, compensation expense, including approximately $1.3 million charged to cost of goods sold was $39.8 million compared with $31.2 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Switching to bottom line. First quarter 2022 GAAP net income was $79.6 million or $1.65 per fully diluted share compared to $72.7 million or $1.51 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. First quarter 2022 non-GAAP net income was $118.3 million or $2.45 per fully diluted share compared with $102.1 million or $2.12 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2021. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q1 2022 were 48.2 million.  Let's look of the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $775.1 million at the end of the first quarter of 2022 compared to $727.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $107.4 million compared with operating cash flow of $28.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. First quarter 2022 capital spending totaled $26.5 million.  Accounts receivable ended the first quarter of 2022 at $120.3 million or 29 days of sales outstanding, up 1 day from 28 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter of 2020 were $311.0 million, up from the $259.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. Days of inventory increased to 178 days at the end of Q1 2022 compared with 166 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021.  Historically, we calculated days inventory on hand as a function of current quarter revenue. We believe comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's projected revenue provides a better economic . On this basis, again, as you can see, days of inventory increased to 159 days at the end of the first quarter of 2022, up from 149 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021.  I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2022. We are forecasting Q2 revenue to remain of $420 million to $440 million. We also expect to follow -- at gross margin in the range of 58.4% to 59.4%, non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 58.7% to 59.3%, GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $132.7 million and $136.7 million, non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $90.0 million to $92.0 million. This doesn't exclude stock compensation and litigation expenses.  Total stock-based compensation expense of $44.2 million to $46.2 million, including approximately $1.5 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold, litigation expenses ranging between $2.3 million and $2.7 million. Interest and other income is expected to range from $1.3 million to $1.7 million before foreign exchange gains or losses, fully diluted shares to be in the range of 47.8 million to 48.8 million shares.  In conclusion, we will continue to execute on our long-term plan for sustainable growth. I will now open the webinar up for questions. Ross is not there. Perhaps we can move on. And if I can add to that, we've also built inventories so that in 178 days, we're just at the lower end of our goal of being between 180 and 200 days, which provides us a good insurance policy as we look ahead to achieving our numbers for the second half of the year. Sure. As you've seen both in the results that we had for Q1, along with our guidance for Q2, which positions us around 59% gross margin, I think we've done a fair job of -- digesting is the incorrect word, but acknowledging the uplift in our margins as a result of our product mix. So again, I'll give the same answer I did last time that we believe that we've created a new floor gross margins once we can expand 10 to 20 basis points sequentially. But again, if opportunistically, we see a back set, which allows us to take it up another, we will be happy to take that.  I want to emphasize that, well, most of our peer companies have benefited both in terms of revenue growth and margin expansion from price increases, Ours has been driven primarily by the change in revenue mix, which is favoring these higher-value products. And it was only in February of this year we did a broad-based increase of our prices but that was still far below what the market has seen. I think, Matt, you did a good job of saying that this is clearly an inflection point for us, inflection year which will gain momentum as we see both Intel and AMD position for product releases are coming up here. So that, in addition to the expanding footprint we have in both 48-volt and artificial intelligence, we believe that this will be one of our areas for sustainable growth for certainly next 3 to 5 years. And exactly as Michael said, we believe that providing better transparency is definitely a better information for our investors. I think that on a dollar or percent basis, we're going to see an accelerating ramp in enterprise, particularly during the second half of the year. I think we're going to see continued growth in our storage and computing albeit probably not at the same rate. Part of the reason for that is that storage tends to be a precursor at least from our experience to a data center ramp. So I think in each of the 2 prior quarters, we've seen a good, strong ramp in storage, and now we're expecting 2 to 3 quarters in the data center.  In the rest of the business, communications, as we said, we've broadened into not only 5G but also into satellite communications. And that's going to continue to be a driver for the foreseeable future. In the other areas, obviously, consumer, that is coming along, we emphasized Internet of Things but we -- actually, the growth there is broad-based. With the testing capacity in Chengdu. We've concentrated that on some of our higher value parts including automotive. And now as Michael just said is now we've started transition where we can actually have third parties. So we actually have a built-in contingency plan. And you took my answer on both ones that lead times have remained very consistent each in the last 3 quarters. And again, what you're seeing as far as the build of inventories has been a very conscious and deliberate decision to build the inventories in advance, particularly on the enterprise side, to meet the demand we expect for the second half of the year. And then I think that we've done a good job of positioning ourselves under what has now become uncertain environment. Just reinforcing the answer from before, there is no significant KPI, whether it's in the bookings or any other area of our business that we're seeing a change over the past 2, 3 quarters. That's helpful. Yes. And I think just to sort of lend some credibility to that, you recall about a year ago, that we offer by the end of Q2, in 2022, that would be at a $2 billion run rate. And with the guide that we have provided and the expectations ahead, I think that's a milestone that backs up the amount of visibility in our supply chain. So right now, the goal as Michael said, $4 billion. And I think that the 48 Volt, not only are we seeing the ramp, its adoption more broadly, but competitively, I would offer that we're very well positioned with some of the new technologies that we've rolled out and expect to roll out during the course of the next 18 months. So I think here again, we time our product releases pretty well with the inflection of this market opportunity. The 5G is a relatively new market segment for us. So it's not like we can draw from our prior experience and calibrated up or down. We're sort of living a little hand to mouth on what demand looks like and how fast we're shipping. So we don't have a real good predictive model. What we talked to you about in the past has been that, again, we believe on a broad base, not only with as you referred to the top 3 but with a number of partners related to 5G infrastructure, we're providing content.  And while it's easy to look at the base station as a means of calculating out what the SAM is available to us. I think that we're also in fiber optic in the data center support for 5G as well as in the transceiver of the base station. And again, I think, as we pointed out, a lot of the initial technology that we're putting in is tending to be lower end and not necessarily specialized or adapted to 5G specifically.  So we don't have the same level of visibility on how it's being deployed, and we've used this strategy in the past with data center. We comment with lower dollar value content, build the relationships and then we're able to go to higher value content. And I think that we continue to be very resilient under a number of environmental circumstances. Part of that is the planning that we've set 3, 4 years ago, and some of it is how diversified long is and some of it is how adaptive we can be in the moment. So again, we did acknowledge the impact our customer supply chain affecting us, but I wouldn't say that, that is a pronounced element and we're continuing to monitor it. Thanks. Let me reference wehat Michael said earlier. It's the power of our model of diversification of the end markets. And if you go back to the performance, the revenue performance that we demonstrated in industrial and automotive last year, they were leaders in our growth drivers. In the current year and reflected what's the health of the 2 end markets, it really came down to it being the timing of shipments.  So we believe that as far as the design rules that are coming in, that we don't believe that we overshipped them to the extent that that's going to cause us a problem. The orders on the book remained incredibly positive. So again, it's just -- it's more different to quarter-over-quarter as opposed to anything fundamentally different about the market. And just to add to Michael's point, as far as phasing out lower margin business, we're trying to rationalize our wafer starts to capture the largest opportunity. And as a result, some of the lower-margin business that we would have used to have in our portfolio, we haven't emphasized that in our production planning. It's just not there as a component of our business like it has been historically. Yes. And just to add to that, Michael, is we have a very good footprint in the commercial side. And because we have so many different client offerings, what we're seeing is being able to sell additional content into those same platforms. Great. Thanks, Gen. I'd like to thank you all for joining us on the Q1 2022 earnings webinar. I look forward to talking to you again during our second quarter conference call, which we would like to be in July. Thank you, and have a nice day."

            "name": "Michael Hsing",
            "content": "Well, Alex, we plan this kind of ramp not from last year from -- not from this year last year, many years ago. And as you remember, in 2017, even '16, we said that we're going to on greenfield products will grow and exactly we don't know at plus or minus a year or so. And so we plan every aspect, including logistics and staff, assembly house and our internal testing. And this is not a 1-year thing. We planned a long time ago. And now when the revenues rent is a little better than we anticipated. And so that's where you see the result. Yes, even the end of the second half of 2019 in -- the business is not as great, but we built according to our plan, and we know the business will come. Our -- at that time, I remember, our inventory is over 200 days. And that part of it, inventories made us -- our customers feel a lot more long more reliable, like MPS as a major player. Just a pass on the cost to our customers. And as the margin expansion for our case, we said earlier, okay, setting in 2017 or '18, we don't have a headwind in -- by 2019. The, market slowed down a little bit and we built up a lot of some amortizations that -- in a production pipeline. So our margin went slightly lower, but it's not much lower. And now and you see this margin continued to grow. Yes. If you combine all together, it's a kind of -- we're going to answer -- in the past, we answered those questions anyway and -- but when we reported on some numbers, and so which is more clear and publish you guys know it, have a less meaningful questions and any other reasons. Yes. We started a couple of years ago. We already started doing so. And as you know that China and manufacturing in Asia is the center of the work, and we can't debate too much or not if they have a serious problems, I think everybody worry about it, even the bigger things. And yes -- the answer is yes, okay. We already started and establish in a different clinical environment. Yes. As we're starting to about a couple of years ago, but maybe it's a little more than 12 months ago, we're starting. Yes, outside Chengdu only, yes, we have -- other than these high reliability product in retesting in our side. And other than that, okay, we do pretty high volumes if it's about half of it. It's in a different facility. When I talk about -- I just mentioned about it is outside China. Our lead time is in this quarter is the same as the last quarter. So probably even our booking even -- I don't see anything. The rate of our booking is now reduced and Bernie, you said. Yes. Well, MPS is like selling . And we are not a dominant application supply. We got something in a. -- I mean so whatever we ship is that these are the small part of the solutions. And so we don't know, okay? That's -- actually, that's our model. That's a billion. We don't know where these costs -- and so whether the wall effectiveness, okay, and we're very, very much diversified. We actually don't know it. And okay, they call you there.  So the -- to answer your questions, I mean, only things, yes, we do know where the product was the data centers. The product if it goes to a car, mean these are we're pretty much not a lot where the product ended up, okay. And other than that, we don't. Yes. That's a good question. I think that we answered the questions in last quarter, okay, we said that we're going to play in the $4 billion of revenues in the next couple of years. And so that's what we do and we continue to invest. Yes. If the demand is there in this year, we will do it, yes. What will do $2 billion, as we said in a couple of years ago. And we continue to see the demand in, and we see the demand will be there. Okay. This is not a one -- a short term, okay, things. And if it does not happen that year, that will happen the year after. Yes. 48 volts actually started in the automotive and also the silver and AI, okay, these CPUs. And for the 48 volts for the car, that's a different thing. but the same technologies. And also, we see these telecom areas, 48 volts, it's all standard and -- so now the 4Gs and the compliance with the 48 volts, again, we have a solution there. So there's a lot of areas we can grow. Yes. And as we're talking with the product, the module is ramping, yes. So we provide -- we're providing whatever customer needs. We had a chip level on module level or solution levels. Let me say that we do have a custom design for each of the areas that Bernie said from fiber optics to all the single chain, all the way to transmitters. And we do have a customer design. And based on our standard product modules -- and these are the products. It's not really a low end. It can be, but these products can be used for any other telecom, which provide a building market, it provide power solutions for each of these blocks -- each of these categories. And we do see a lot of activity now in the revenues is ramping now. Well, the strategy is we're fired as many cylinders we can, okay? Whenever it grows, we grow, okay? And I think that's the strength among the diversifications. And in the next few quarters, we see the demand even for 2023 and '24, and these are pretty much similar, okay? We don't see that much of a difference.  And one thing we see it, okay, they -- we -- our customers demand more high-value product, which means they can easily adopt in ease of use and a much higher efficiency product and an energy using efficiency product. And so these are much better for us. Instead of our customer do lot development work, we do a lot of development work for our -- we develop the solution for our customers. So that means a higher dollar amount -- a higher dollar content. And so that's really we see that as only difference. Absolutely hit us. And don't get me wrong. Even though we grow this much, if we were not that problem, so we ship a whole lot more but we just have -- we anticipated that a little better. So we can still roll in our -- one of our models, can mean there's not much of our model. And for the portion is above our model, even a year, 2 years and again.  And on the other hand, in -- other than our logistics and production limitations, our customers, they have a mix, too. And clearly, you see the auto business. I mean we have less problem of shipping product than other suppliers. So -- and you can't speculate in okay, because of in limited or -- they are buying -- they're purchasing of our product and for because they miss other parts. You remember that. That's good. Yes. Okay, as always said, okay, about a few minutes ago, I said that our customers even demands the more higher value product, can be in a solution kind of related products, not they wanted a low their engineering effort to MPS. And I see that opportunity is the opportunities for accelerated growth because think about it, if it's MPS, we don't make any and we're just only testing the final control -- quality control.  And that can apply to anything else. And I apply to models, apply tools okay, applied to any other solutions at all, but it's all related to power all related to OEM. And so from now on, you will see MPS, okay, we provide plug-and-play solution for all kind of robotics, for industrial automation and for building controls. And those type of product and -- which has a lot higher ASPs, we buy those components or we specify those components and we incorporate to our solutions. So the unit price will be much higher.  And now it's how fast we can put all these solutions together and turn it into a meaningful revenue. And that, I can't predict. And then you have that product, a lot of knowledges too. Now at the same time, MPS is a semiconductor chip business, keep growing. So I don't see in the near term in the next year or so. I don't see any slowdown, and it's actually accelerated.  And so to the other model is at the very infancies. And if you go 3 or 4, 5 years from now, I think as we will be real solution companies like silicon semiconductor is only a part of it out in the total content. So I want to grow more. I've seen more than $10 billion of companies, I mean $10 billion, $15 billion company, and there is no reason why not? Yes. It's or committed to sell our communications and not only in the cell like self the grand station there's a huge amount. There's new standards, and again, there's a lot of new activities in that. And we designed it into a few years ago. And mostly, it's a power modules. And also, we have related to these in the cell and I mean this a controlled the solar panels and also a lot of power box. And I think the value in this is so -- this is everywhere, okay -- and these are for antenna to powering up the antenna to power the receivers and also all the way down to the user interface, and we all benefit from. Thank you. Yes, Ross, you're there. I don't know how to qualify that, okay, because we don't -- we didn't really -- we didn't increase the price, okay, for those customers the first tier, the value the strategic customers because this prices are negotiated way before that. And we have the audit. And so we always said what we do. It's what we said what we do, okay? So we have to honor that.  And I think that also is a part of MPS branding and so that benefits the for long term. And for other high-value customers or high-value products and it's sporadic. This is the very beginning, a lot of customers don't even know or you offer these solutions but you offer that the entire solutions and -- so they don't even know that, okay. MPS is just starting to. And that actually relates to a few years ago, we said that we're going to do e-commerce, okay? We do e-commerce plug-and-play, programmable, all these things. And these are all related.  And so we do solar only for large customers, and I said we're a satellite company. We have the EV companies. We have a day 1 MPS, do a lot more or even the data centers and the demand of all these, we provide the entire unit. And they don't have to design it. So that's actually a across the board. I just named a few. But revenue is still small. We're starting. Makes sense. That was good question. And also, one of the questions is why the margin goes up and if these are 2 segments go sideways, okay? I mean the year-to-year -- year-over-year growth, I mean, if you look at it from a Q3 last year to now, those segments -- that contributes a lot of margins, okay, gross margins.  And the other segments, like consumers, I mean we phased out and there can be this not on the last year. So maybe the year, beginning of the last year. When the capacity gets issues, as you know, we always phase out these lower margin. That's another part of it. And -- but overall, the greenfield products drive the margins. I think it's the solution, yes, you're right, okay? And then now the question is does depend on applications, 48 volts, down to 12 volts, down to directly to 1.2 volts. That's at the last part, okay, we don't do that and our customers -- and there's the few providers of the solution is not come -- and so we play in the market. I mean it's not to 12, 48 convert to 12 and convert 5 -- 4 or 5 volts, okay? That's the market we played. We came in and it's open builder materials. Everybody else can jump into it. And we -- so our competitor provides a similar solution.  And so that kind of -- we know this is the application, but which one, we don't know. Which one is hard to tell. All these high current products, and you probably know more than I do, okay, goes to 600 watt to 1,000 watts and even some of the couple of 1,000 watts. You see these are all MPS solutions now and these are -- the higher wattage you go, the volts get smaller.  And so in the coming years and those accelerate the costs, okay, the population in the data centers. And that's where you see it. These are 48 volts that convert to 12. And then you have a new solutions that we provide so you can to a firewall. So okay, an increase close to 1% of efficiency, which is a lot. Yes. We obviously -- okay, and we do well. And we do PCs and case PC, the commercial PCs, that even the low end of business from OEs. And -- but for us, it's a very opportunistic because we have a product developed for server. And without much of an engineering effort, we can spin off to do other products. We did a product for commercial PC and for commercial norms.  And on the other end, we do battery management. We do actually panel. And -- pretty much, we can offer an mobile solutions other than memories, other than the CPUs. And so that's -- it's very opportunistic. And we -- currently, we see the demand is very strong."

Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS, and Bernie Blegen, EVP and CFO. In the course of today's webinar, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q4 earnings release and in our latest SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q, which are accessible through our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes, net income, and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Tables that outline the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures are included in our Q4 2023 earnings release. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release, which was furnished to the SEC earlier today and is available on our website as well. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.\nBernie Blegen: Thanks Gen. For the full-year of 2023 MPS achieved record revenue of $1.82 billion. This is our 12th consecutive year of revenue growth driven by consistent execution, continued innovation and strong customer focus. As announced today, MPS is expanding into a new $1 billion market with the acquisition of our partner Axign B.V. Axign is a Netherlands-based startup with early revenue, specializing in programmable multi-core digital signal processors. Axign competitive difference is its ability to deliver signals with near-zero distortion and reduce power consumption for automotive and consumer audio systems. The combination of Axign and MPS's IP, which has been accepted by several high-end audio customers, will change people's experience in their cars, homes, concert venues, and stadiums. Let me turn to a few highlights from this past year. Our integrated power management solutions for artificial intelligence enabled our customers to unlock previously untapped opportunities for innovation and growth. We created new automotive content, powering the ramp of autonomous driving, the digital cockpit and lighting systems for both conventional and electric vehicles. We continued to diversify our global R&D footprint with the further expansion of our engineering centers of excellence in Europe and Taiwan. And finally, we continue to expand and diversify our operating footprint with the qualification of multiple new fab and packaging partners in Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia. Turning to our full-year 2023 revenue by market segment. Automotive revenue grew $94.6 million year-over-year to $394.7 million in 2023. This 31.5% gain was primarily driven by increased sales of our highly integrated applications supporting advanced driver assistance systems, the digital cockpit and lighting applications. Automotive revenue represented 21.7% of MTS's full-year 2023 revenue, compared with 16.7% in 2022. Full year 2023 enterprise data revenue grew $71.6 million over the prior year to $323 million. This 28.5% increase was primarily due to higher sales of our power management solutions for AI applications. Enterprise Data revenue represented 17.7% of MPS\u2019 total revenue in 2023, compared with 14.8% in 2022. Storage and computing revenue for 2023 grew $38.5 million over the prior year to $491.1 million. This 8.5% increase was primarily driven by increased sales of products for notebooks. Storage and computing revenue represented 27.0% of MPS\u2019 total revenue in 2023, compared with 25.3% in 2022. Communications revenue fell by $46.5 million to $204.9 million, this 18.5% reduction was a result of lower 4G and 5G infrastructure sales. Communications revenue represented 11.3% of our 2023 revenue, compared with 14.0% in 2022. Industrial revenue fell by $46.5 million to $172.7 million in 2023. This 21.2% decrease primarily reflected lower sales in applications for industrial automation, security and power sources. Industrial revenue represented 9.4% of MPS' full-year 2023 revenue, compared with 12.2% in 2022. Consumer revenue decreased $84.8 million to $234.7 million in 2023. This 26.6% year-over-year decrease was a result of broad market weakness across all segments. Consumer revenue represented 12.9% of MPS' full-year 2023 revenue compared with 17.8% in 2022. Let me take a moment to talk about the general business conditions. Throughout 2023, we highlighted that customer ordering patterns were oscillating, reflecting general economic uncertainty. While we saw a nominal improvement in Q4 ordering patterns, we remain cautious as visibility beyond the current quarter is limited. Despite this ongoing uncertainty, we continue to execute against our long-term strategy by bringing innovative new products to market and expanding design wins across our broad base of customers. We believe these ongoing investments position us well for future growth when the macro environment stabilizes. Switching to Q4 results. MPS had fourth quarter revenue of $454.0 million, down 4.4% from the third quarter of 2023 and down 1.3% from the fourth quarter of 2022. Comparing year-over-year results, fourth quarter 2023 revenue for enterprise data grew by 88.4%. Storage and computing fell 2.9%. Automotive was down 7.8%, Consumer decreased 17.5%, Communications decreased 36.3% and Industrial fell 40.5%. Fourth quarter 2023 GAAP gross margin was 55.3%, down 20 basis points from the third quarter of 2023 and 290 basis points below the fourth quarter of 2022. Fourth quarter 2023 non-GAAP gross margin was 55.7%, flat with the third quarter of 2023, but 280 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2022. This year-over-year reduction in fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin is largely due to sales mix. Turning to operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $141.6 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $128 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $130.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2023 operating expenses were $96.7 million, roughly flat with the third quarter of 2023 and up from the $94.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022. The differences between GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Fourth quarter 2023 stock compensation expense, including $1.2 million charge to cost of goods sold was $41.1 million, compared with $33.6 million recorded in the third quarter of 2023. Switching to the bottom line. Fourth quarter 2023, GAAP net income was $96.9 million or $1.98 per fully diluted share, compared with $2.48 per share in the third quarter of 2023 and $2.45 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Q4 2023 non-GAAP net income was $140.9 million or $2.88 per fully diluted share, compared with $3.08 per share in the third quarter of 2023 and $3.17 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q4 2023 were $48.9 million. As for our balance sheet, as of December 31, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.11 billion, compared to $1.04 billion at the end of the third quarter 2023. For the fourth quarter of 2023, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $153.3 million, compared with $175.9 million in Q3 2023. Fourth quarter 2023 capital spending totaled $13.8 million. Accounts receivable ended the fourth quarter of 2023 at $179.9 million, compared with the $185.8 million reported at the end of the third quarter of 2023 and $182.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. There were 36 days of sales outstanding across these comparable periods. Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 were $383.7 million down from the $397.3 million at the end of the third quarter of 2023. Days of inventory rose to 172 days at the end of Q4 2023 from 171 days at the end of third quarter of 2023. We have carefully managed our internal inventories throughout the year given the uncertainty in the market. Using next quarter revenue as a basis, inventory was 175 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, down from 178 days at the end of the third quarter of 2023. I would now like to turn to our Q1 2024 outlook. We are forecasting Q1 2024 revenue in the range of $437.0 million to $457.0 million. GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.1% to 55.7%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.4% to 56.0%. Total stock-based compensation expense, including associated employer taxes of $46.2 million to $48.2 million, including approximately $1.4 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold. GAAP operating expenses between $147.2 million and $151.2 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $101.8 million to $103.8 million. This estimate excludes stock-based compensation expense and amortization of recently purchased intangible assets, but includes litigation expense and the expense from our recent Axign acquisition. Other income before foreign exchange gains or losses expected to range from $5.3 million to $5.7 million. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of $48.8 million to $49.2 million of shares. We continue to execute the share buyback program that was announced in our Q3 '23 earnings call. Finally, I am pleased to announce a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.25 per share from $1 per share for stockholders of record as of March 29, 2024. In conclusion, while we continue to be cautious about the near-term business conditions, we believe our long-term growth strategy remains intact, and we can swiftly adapt to market changes as they occur. I will now open the webinar up for questions.\nOperator:\nA - Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.\nQuinn Bolton: Can you hear me? Michael, Bernie, can you hear me?\nMichael Hsing: Yes.\nBernie Blegen: Yes, we can. Speak up.\nQuinn Bolton: Hey, congratulations on the very stable outlook in a pretty choppy environment. Looks like the enterprise data segment was up $30 million quarter-on-quarter, really driving a lot of the growth in the near term. As you look into 2024, can you just talk about your expectations for enterprise data specifically your opportunity to perhaps expand the customer set with some of the other leading GPU and AI accelerator companies? And then I've got a follow-on question. Thank you.\nBernie Blegen: Sure. I'll take that, Quinn. As far as the initial ramp that we've been experiencing over about the last four quarters, we've really seen or benefited from the acceleration of demand for these applications and solutions. As we look ahead, we see a broadening of the number of market participants or customers that will be participating in that. But at the same time, we also believe that competition within the supply chain will continue. So for a majority of the period to-date, we've enjoyed a pretty high percentage of market share, but expect that to decrease as we introduce second and third suppliers.\nMichael Hsing: But overall, the overall added -- overall, the market segment is and grow very rapidly. And we're expanding our production lines and we will meet in the second-half for the demand.\nQuinn Bolton: Got it. Maybe just looking at sort of the road map for some of these accelerators in 2024. I think you guys have some new ramps with probably higher content, but I think you also have perhaps lower cost cards coming out where you guys may see a step down in your dollar content. Can you just kind of walk through the puts and takes? We should be thinking about your average dollar content per win? Do you still see that trending higher as power consumption goes up? Or is the increase in competition and perhaps efforts to design cost down cards starting to perhaps limit that dollar content opportunity?\nMichael Hsing: The dollar content is -- well, it's -- as a market accelerating again, we have more -- our competitor joining and especially this rate of ramp in -- and also, we see other players, other AI players will enter the market that we are so far, we're behind whether pretty much the sole source of power solutions. And as you see the second half or sometime next year, you will see a lot of other players to be qualified or they solve their -- one of the technical problem is, okay, or the odds. So that's what we expect. The cost side, okay, we're always lowering our cost. And at this time, we want to solve all the problems and we believe we resolve all these issues and during this fast ramp. And also the cost at this time is not really the issue. It's all about the throughput and to meet the customer demand.\nBernie Blegen: And one final comment on content is that with each following generation of new products that are being introduced for AI, the power requirements are increasing. And at this point, we have a belief that the dollar content will go up per server. But at this point, it's very hard to gauge that.\nMichael Hsing: In the next version of it is -- the power is even higher -- is much higher as Bernie said. And we started to do these product developments back in a couple of years ago. And we're about to release it to our customers in this quarter and the next couple of quarters.\nQuinn Bolton: Perfect, thanks. Thank you for all that color.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.\nRick Schafer: Yes, thanks. I'll have my congratulations as well. A couple of questions, if I could. I guess, Michael, I'm curious if you could kind of elaborate a little bit, I'm curious what surprised you the most, the last 90-days or so. I'm thinking particularly of auto, obviously, enterprise data was stronger than expected, but auto seems like it's kind of materially gotten softer for most in the last 90-days. So I was curious if you could comment on what you're seeing there. And of course, you guys had, I think, a couple of delayed model year launches last year and the second half. And I was just getting -- trying to get a sense of when those might ramp. And if you consider that an offset maybe to a slower auto market at large.\nMichael Hsing: Good questions, good observation. And towards the end of the last year, it kind of -- auto slowed down. But overall, we as Bernie said earlier, we still grow some high 20%, 30% somewhere in the overall -- in the auto segment. These are mostly primary -- mostly due to the ADS the infotainment or whatever the head units, call it, the digital cockpit. And going for next year we believe we see all the activities and customers and nowadays consuming all these inventories that we shipped and in May or June period times, and now they start to have a higher volume ramp and especially in the EV side. So for this year's first part of this year.\nBernie Blegen: So I think that there has been some softness that has occurred in Q3 of last -- Q3 and Q4 of last year that was observable both for IC and EVs. And as we said in our earlier comments and it applies to automotive, we don't have great visibility beyond just the next quarter. So it's hard for us to predict with the second-half of \u201824, the ramp might look like for automotive.\nMichael Hsing: Right, the ramp is in the early adoption in EV is very lumpy and a different automakers and ramping in different schedules, I mean -- but overall, the trend is they will pull out more EV with more our products.\nRick Schafer: Thanks, Michael. And if I could follow up, I know Quinn was asking about some of the 48-volt stuff. I was curious, I mean, you guys are so dominant on this in second stage 48-volt, and I know you've got a stage 1 product now as well. So I didn't know if you could give us a sense of what your expectations are for share or revenue contribution. However, you'd like to discuss it. But I'm curious sort of what Stage 1 power will do to your content, we'll do for your -- for that enterprise data segment. And I also was curious only because you mentioned it a couple of times, new competition coming in 48-volt. And I was just curious to get your thoughts on if it gets harder or the competition going forward as guys like NVIDIA move from a two-year cadence on new processor development to an annual cadence.\nMichael Hsing: All right. Yes. This game is always the best performers. So far, our competition, we don't -- I don't want to speak our competition. So far, in what we have, okay, and our customers can be very receptive to our solution. So far, we pretty much have a majority of the volumes. And they keep requesting it and keep requesting we solve all these issues related to their system issues, ours and issues from our side. And -- so when -- even the volume gets even bigger it's good to have another source. Otherwise, again, you don't want the MPS, they can all of them. So again, that's not what we intend to do. And so -- and also the competition in -- it's exactly like a server side. And we are the newcomer in the server market back in -- a couple of years ago, and that's how we win the market. And we had a product long before that. And we also need -- we had to dump the down to meet the common footprints. And because the power density is not high enough. And when this AI come out on the market, the common footprint is not a requirement. So we start to win a lot of -- a lot of shares. And the same is in the servers and have a very similar trend. And that's how we win the market. And we always want to do, as we said in the past. We want to pushing the technology. We want to make sure we're the best.\nRick Schafer: And Michael, any sense of Stage 2 -- or sorry, Stage 1 contribution this year for you guys?\nMichael Hsing: Yes, okay. We had some issues on the Stage 1s and we had some design wins and very small volumes in different systems, actually. And now we don't have -- all these issues are resolved. That will significantly gain the content. And in each AR systems.\nBernie Blegen: And Stage 1, for us, at least, is represented about 20%, 25% of the dollar content of Stage 2, and we expect to see the incremental ramp from these products in Q1 and Q2.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. We had shipping these products for some of the 48-Volt systems. And also, we supply the -- we are as a supplier for chip and for the silicon, not for the modules. And now we step up the two modules.\nRick Schafer: Great. Thank you guys.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matt, your line is now open.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Congrats guys. Good afternoon. I'm going to ask both of my questions here together because we got two or three calls going on tonight and I don't want to end up on two lines. I don't know that we want to go interweaving earnings calls. But my two questions are the first one, Michael, since you helped found the company, you guys have not been active in M&A traditionally. So I'd be interested to hear a little bit more about the company you're acquiring the markets that you're going to go after how that whole deal came together and what the prospects for that new technologies that you may -- and people that you may roll into the company. Just any background there.\nMichael Hsing: That's a great question. So otherwise, we are taking to the old AI call.\nMatt Ramsay: Just really quickly on my second one, so I'll go back. Bernie, if you could just help us out with the guidance for March by segment, that would be helpful to make sure we're all modeling from the same footing.\nMichael Hsing: All right. Let me answer your first question. And you said it's inactive in the M&A market. That's not true, okay? And we follow our -- well, it's not really a policy. So we follow what we do for the best for our shareholders. We don't acquire revenue. The reason is cheap to grow revenue for MPS. But we do look -- do apply technology. And so this is the -- in the past, actually, we acquired a field and financially immaterial with our shareholders. And at this time, and it's big enough, we made these disclosures. And to talking about this Axign, is the company that we work with in for three years already. And it's proven that their technology and with our power stage and there will be a huge benefit for -- in audio signal to audio amplification fields. And we have a proven in a very, very, very high-end customers and make these products as a very unique and never achieved in histories that no zero disposing signals and same to speakers. And the cost is very low. The way we achieved that. And also, we achieved a lot of programmable is also software adaptive. And that -- I see it when I listen to those sounds, it's really -- you bring audio first we put in the press release, putting audio quality to everybody's home to lower down -- really low down the cost. And that will revolutionize how we listened.\nBernie Blegen: Matt, I'll take the second question then on the guidance as far as what we're looking at for Q1 here. The growth driver is remains the enterprise data. The positive there is that in addition to AI, we're also seeing incremental positive demand for our traditional CPU data center solutions. When you look at the other groups, you -- basically, we see a flattening in comms, but then we see declines that sort of range between the high single digits and low double digits in the sequential growth between Q4 and Q1 for the other groups. Does that answer your question, Matt. Gen, I think we can move to the next one.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you, Michael, Bernie. And congratulations on 12th consecutive year of growth, especially in this environment. That's stunning. My first question for you, Michael, is 2024. So you've already talked about AI and Bernie just sort of gave us directionally things for Q1. But you always seem to surprise us a little bit but something throughout the year. So I'm just wondering, is there anything that you could share with us that could happen either in industrial or communications. I'm not thinking about cyclical stuff. I'm thinking about more sort of new secular stuff that you're working on that could surprise us on the upside this year.\nMichael Hsing: Well, instead of -- well, last year, the growth is not very spectacular. It's like what is a single digit -- 1.5%. Okay. It's -- Yes, okay. But this year, I think is who knows. In last year, we didn't know until ChatGPT happened. Then the AI business took off and was out of our expectations, I mean, we didn't know. But to answer your questions to comment your question 11, what is it, 12 years, 11 years in consecutive year-by-year growth. And it's -- we follow our principles. And again, we want to -- first thing, okay, we want to make sure it\u2019s all the product, what we deliver to our customers is the best product, best performers. And we want to beat all our competition. That's number one. Number two is, we react. We react fast, we're nimble, and we fulfill our customer demand. And that's sort of pretty simple strategy that we followed and we kind of disregarded of what the market segment does. And we don't chase those market segments. This year, who knows, okay, with one of the segments and we'll grow, but I don't expect it we'll grow as big as AI, okay? But maybe a couple of small segments happening and I do see that. And we do see that in the recent quarters and the last quarter source and we see all these orders come in and they came in as we expected, those products are truly better than our competitors.\nTore Svanberg: Makes sense. And as my follow-up, I think most people, when they think about MPS, obvious they think about power management and how much share you've gained there. But when I look at the Axign acquisition, I think about your penetration into the data converter space, you're doing much more stuff on the single processing side. I mean, you're clearly building out, I think, a pretty impressive portfolio in what I would call more the mixed signal part of the market. So will you be able to maybe share that with us over time? I don't know, a percentage of revenue collectively so how much these subsegments can represent for the overall business?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Okay. I think in the next couple of years, and you will see some significant growth from a different area, from a single processing and for data converters and for -- of course, we talk about today and the audio process, and which we're already designing and some consumer -- high-volume consumer market segment. And later, we're going to get into automotive and automotive business. And other ones, we have a lot of small things. A lot of other things like silicon carbides and for silicon carbide projects for green energies for solar -- and for solar inverters. And -- well, these are still kind of power management, but a lot of them, we are other power, and these are for communications. And for communications in between -- in the solar side, okay, so from the inverter side. And even the automotive side back to automotive side, and there's a lot of other communication in the -- within the car, and we'll develop those type of products. And you see MPS in the next few years will migrate out to dose a second to those segments.\nTore Svanberg: Excellent. Thank you and congrats again.\nMichael Hsing: Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open.\nWilliam Stein: Hey, thanks. I'll add my congrats to the remarkably stable outlook. And along those lines, the company has had a longer-term revenue growth and margin model that you have talked about in the past. I think the way you say it is either plus growth or around 20 top line and then 10 to 20 bps per quarter on gross margin. We've been sort of really outside of that model as things have been really volatile since -- really since COVID started, I guess, but I wonder if we're potentially honing back into that model? Or should we sort of throw that away and not think about that anymore? How would you encourage us to think about revenue growth and margins longer term?\nMichael Hsing: Yes, those kind of models is models and models. And -- but I think the given time and we will be back in a model is the model can be. It's like a weather forecasting, right? we build models and we didn't predict this thunderstorms. And for like the last couple of years, our model is not correct. And either we have too much we too little. So given those kind of economic, whether it's the environment and that model is not quite right. But they end up -- and also, our model is not very scientific either okay, is based on our empirical historical reasons, okay? And -- but we should not deviate from what we see now again.\nBernie Blegen: And just to give people a refresh of what the model is that Will is referring to is, generally speaking, we outperformed the market by 10 to 15 percentage points and in the stable market conditions where it's growing between about 5% and 8%, it's easy to assume that would be between 15% and 20% growth. On the gross margin or range that we targeted about on a non-GAAP basis, is between 55% and 60%. And then when the environment is more predictable, we look to be able to grow gross margin 10 to 15 percentage points -- or basis points on quarterly successive quarters.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. I might as well added, okay. We emphasize the product development and also the customers design win. And I do see a lot of wins and many different segments I said earlier and probably I forgot even half of it, okay, in my mind. And there are so many things going on. And -- so going in the future and when a normalize -- as Bernie said, is a more normalized economic conditions. And there's no reason we will not grow -- we grow 1.5%, okay? That's at least say it that way, okay.\nBernie Blegen: But the market contracted 10%.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, yes. Okay. Yes.\nWilliam Stein: We certainly are outgrowing long-term, no doubt. The other thing I'd like to ask about is inventories. I think on your own balance sheet, you're running below your long-term target now, maybe the maybe my view of the targeted sale. I'm not sure, maybe you can just update us on inventory relative to your target and also in the channel, what you think is going on there, please? Thanks so much.\nBernie Blegen: Sure. I can take that one. So as a reminder, the model is days on our balance sheet between 180 to 200 days. We came in at about the low 170s this quarter, which was really a reflection of how we have been managing our inventory in this uncertain environment. Having said that, we've started a lot of wafer starts ahead of what we believe will be a potential upside certainly in the next few quarters. As far as the channel, that's been a difficult aspect of this market for everybody. And we've had our share of putting inventory in the channel, but I'm very happy to report that over the last three quarters, it's been coming down appreciably. And we're right now just a little bit above our model.\nMichael Hsing: We will start to build inventory.\nBernie Blegen: Yes.\nWilliam Stein: Great. Thanks so much guys.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Travis Polan of Wells Fargo. Travis, your line is now open.\nTravis Polan: Hi, guys. This is Travis on for Gary. Congratulations on the results. I was wondering if you could provide color on how your customer base has evolved through 2023. Historically, MPS has been diverse from this perspective. But did any customer approach 10%? And along those lines, how do you expect this mix to evolve as we move into 2024?\nMichael Hsing: Yes, I see these data we grow our small customer base in -- by a few thousand in last year. And that's kind of exciting. And it doesn't mean we add a lot of revenues. And in the longer term, the wealthy I mean -- the bigger the base, the better it is, the more stable MPS will be. And also, you don't know -- and what's the next hardest things, okay? And our customers will decide that. But the market will decide it. Our customer will take opportunity. If it's not this one, that one well. I mean we just explained that play the percentage. And we just have our products goes out the door. Goes to design in those -- to those customers. And in terms of which segments I have to say it's everywhere. This is okay. The -- I can't remember any numbers more than our grow orders more than five or six things. And -- but that's the beauty you won't go 1,000. I mean that takes a few years and it will turn into bigger revenues.\nBernie Blegen: And Travis, it's an excellent question because I think to align with Michael's point there is that the strength of MPS as far as resilience in different market conditions, is the breadth of the customer base and not have high levels of concentration. Now obviously, with this environment where it has been generally weak except for AI we're in sort of an unusual profile, but we don't expect that to last over the next couple three years.\nTravis Polan: Got it. Thank you for the color. That\u2019s all from me.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, okay.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.\nTore Svanberg: Yes, thank you. I just had two quick follow-ups. First of all, is on revenue capacity. So I know in the past, Michael, you talked about sort of getting to $2 billion in capacity. Obviously, you're there now. But then also any updates on getting to $3 and even $4 billion of revenue capacity?\nMichael Hsing: We are building for $4 billion revenues, again, in capacities. And we -- actually we never changed. And especially out of China, and we -- and that actually fits our plan. and we'll continue to do that. And these kind of capacity issues you look at MPS business. And we see -- we believe these business will grow -- we grow our capacity accordingly. It's really a disregarded, okay, what's the current environment we address for long-term issues.\nTore Svanberg: Very good. And then the other follow-up, any updates on the e-commerce business. We haven't heard about that in a while. So I just want to make sure we check in with you and get an update there.\nMichael Hsing: Our module business is -- our -- pure e-commerce, I said it, okay, we didn't know what we are talking about and wasn't that excitement and exciting. But the combination of it and with our web service in the e-commerce and also some interactions help from our website. That generates 150 million units now -- last year. And I can't call it in -- what was that, like seven, eight years ago, seven, eight years ago, we're going to these e-commerce business customers logging our website, we're going to -- they can change their -- they can input their parameters and program our ports, we ship the product within a week or so. That didn't happen that much. But -- and yes, it's happening. But I still believe in the long term, that will be the business because we are loading the power management. We're loading all these product designing barriers. And -- why not? People can program the part and especially younger generations. And they have -- they rather program a product rather than use a solid line, putting us in the arms and get and go to a lab is okay to make it happen. And I think it's longer younger generations would do that. And it will be different from other generations, my generation. And that business I believe in the long-term, we're still picking up. But for now, was more than that bad. I cannot say that way.\nTore Svanberg: Great. Thank you, again.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Melissa Fairbanks of Raymond James. Melissa, your line is now open.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Hey, guys. Thanks very much. I was wondering if maybe I could squeeze one in about storage and computing business. I know it's not quite as exciting maybe as what's going on in enterprise data.\nMichael Hsing: That's not good.\nMelissa Fairbanks: I noted that you did pick up some business on the notebook side last year that was kind of opportunistic. We've got some seasonal factors coming in, in March. We've kind of heard that channel inventories, at least on the PC notebook side have normalized somewhat. But wondering if you could just give us a little bit of color on the storage portion of that business that we don't seem to talk about very much.\nMichael Hsing: You know, the answer already. And I said, overall, it's not good. Overall, we take on some market shares, and we start to grow a little bit.\nBernie Blegen: So I think the way to look at it is that we anticipated softness in the storage market. And so as a result, we became more competitive on notebooks an accepted lower-margin business. And it was offsetting declines, particularly in SSD where we've seen a decline. We increased share with a lot of the major customers in the SSD market, but their business was in decline for much of 2023. And then the other positive in the group is that we saw the initial ramp of DDR5 during the year and also graphic cards expanded pretty nicely during the year. So this is a group that has different characteristics and net-net did pretty okay in a pretty difficult market.\nMichael Hsing: Well, I think the DDR5, we expect to ramp in last year, right? I mean it happened didn't happen that fast. I mean -- so the key is, again, we make sure our product is designing and when these products will ramp, it's not up to us. And we actually care less but only care is we have a product to ship. Okay.\nMelissa Fairbanks: All right. Thanks very much, Michael, I'm sorry to bring up a sore point.\nMichael Hsing: It's not a sore point. It's a reality like everybody else is.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Sure. Alright thanks guys.\nMichael Hsing: Alright, thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.\nQuinn Bolton: Hey, guys. Just wanted to follow-up, Bernie, I think you had mentioned that in addition to the GPU and AI, you guys are starting to see better traction on just the core CPU server market I know in the past, you've talked about your goal to try to get your share in that segment to 25%. So wondering if you might just give us an update where do you think your share is in CPU core power today? And how are you feeling about that 25% market share target over, say, the next couple of years? Thanks.\nBernie Blegen: Sure. So what really generates interest with our customers is when they see the new product launches at both Intel and AMD ramping and we do the power management for both of those. And I think that as we observed in the last year or even 18 months that the most recent versions of their products have been delayed. And so we've experienced a slower ramp as far as being able to increase share or content on those platforms. But at least initially, is it was observing for Q1 as well as for the balance of '24, we see that both of those ramps starting to improve and that we'll participate with them. At this point, we don't have any reason to doubt our earlier projections as far as overall share opportunity between 20% and 30%. But right at this particular moment, it's hard to say what we have.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Let me talk about this in looking and we didn't have any. And we are 13.5% and because that was about 2.5 years ago, we have a lot of design wins. We have a design win, a few but for me came in the customers -- at their customers, they couldn't get the -- couldn't ship. And we are turning to be the bigger players. We are four teams in -- back in a few years ago, that we're designing a many different projects. And we expect to be a bigger player. And so that's -- we still believe the same story. And when the CPU market picks up and our revenue will start resume to growth. And so what is the last year, and I don't even remember what was the last year, there wasn't spectacular numbers anyway. And I think as soon or later will turn around.\nQuinn Bolton: Got it. Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: [Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.\nBernie Blegen: Great. Thank you very much, everybody. I'd like to thank you for joining us on this conference call, and look forward to talking to you again in our first quarter which will be in late April. And just to add to that, at that time, we'll be introducing a new format for this call. We will provide you content and context on how the end markets have performed in a written manner, and then we will use the conference call portion more for Q&A. So we believe that, that will be a more efficient use of your time and ours and also more complete communication. So with that, I will thank you. And again, I look forward to seeing you again in April.",

            "content": "Thanks Gen. For the full-year of 2023 MPS achieved record revenue of $1.82 billion. This is our 12th consecutive year of revenue growth driven by consistent execution, continued innovation and strong customer focus. As announced today, MPS is expanding into a new $1 billion market with the acquisition of our partner Axign B.V. Axign is a Netherlands-based startup with early revenue, specializing in programmable multi-core digital signal processors. Axign competitive difference is its ability to deliver signals with near-zero distortion and reduce power consumption for automotive and consumer audio systems. The combination of Axign and MPS's IP, which has been accepted by several high-end audio customers, will change people's experience in their cars, homes, concert venues, and stadiums. Let me turn to a few highlights from this past year. Our integrated power management solutions for artificial intelligence enabled our customers to unlock previously untapped opportunities for innovation and growth. We created new automotive content, powering the ramp of autonomous driving, the digital cockpit and lighting systems for both conventional and electric vehicles. We continued to diversify our global R&D footprint with the further expansion of our engineering centers of excellence in Europe and Taiwan. And finally, we continue to expand and diversify our operating footprint with the qualification of multiple new fab and packaging partners in Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia. Turning to our full-year 2023 revenue by market segment. Automotive revenue grew $94.6 million year-over-year to $394.7 million in 2023. This 31.5% gain was primarily driven by increased sales of our highly integrated applications supporting advanced driver assistance systems, the digital cockpit and lighting applications. Automotive revenue represented 21.7% of MTS's full-year 2023 revenue, compared with 16.7% in 2022. Full year 2023 enterprise data revenue grew $71.6 million over the prior year to $323 million. This 28.5% increase was primarily due to higher sales of our power management solutions for AI applications. Enterprise Data revenue represented 17.7% of MPS' total revenue in 2023, compared with 14.8% in 2022. Storage and computing revenue for 2023 grew $38.5 million over the prior year to $491.1 million. This 8.5% increase was primarily driven by increased sales of products for notebooks. Storage and computing revenue represented 27.0% of MPS' total revenue in 2023, compared with 25.3% in 2022. Communications revenue fell by $46.5 million to $204.9 million, this 18.5% reduction was a result of lower 4G and 5G infrastructure sales. Communications revenue represented 11.3% of our 2023 revenue, compared with 14.0% in 2022. Industrial revenue fell by $46.5 million to $172.7 million in 2023. This 21.2% decrease primarily reflected lower sales in applications for industrial automation, security and power sources. Industrial revenue represented 9.4% of MPS' full-year 2023 revenue, compared with 12.2% in 2022. Consumer revenue decreased $84.8 million to $234.7 million in 2023. This 26.6% year-over-year decrease was a result of broad market weakness across all segments. Consumer revenue represented 12.9% of MPS' full-year 2023 revenue compared with 17.8% in 2022. Let me take a moment to talk about the general business conditions. Throughout 2023, we highlighted that customer ordering patterns were oscillating, reflecting general economic uncertainty. While we saw a nominal improvement in Q4 ordering patterns, we remain cautious as visibility beyond the current quarter is limited. Despite this ongoing uncertainty, we continue to execute against our long-term strategy by bringing innovative new products to market and expanding design wins across our broad base of customers. We believe these ongoing investments position us well for future growth when the macro environment stabilizes. Switching to Q4 results. MPS had fourth quarter revenue of $454.0 million, down 4.4% from the third quarter of 2023 and down 1.3% from the fourth quarter of 2022. Comparing year-over-year results, fourth quarter 2023 revenue for enterprise data grew by 88.4%. Storage and computing fell 2.9%. Automotive was down 7.8%, Consumer decreased 17.5%, Communications decreased 36.3% and Industrial fell 40.5%. Fourth quarter 2023 GAAP gross margin was 55.3%, down 20 basis points from the third quarter of 2023 and 290 basis points below the fourth quarter of 2022. Fourth quarter 2023 non-GAAP gross margin was 55.7%, flat with the third quarter of 2023, but 280 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2022. This year-over-year reduction in fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin is largely due to sales mix. Turning to operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $141.6 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $128 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $130.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our non-GAAP fourth quarter 2023 operating expenses were $96.7 million, roughly flat with the third quarter of 2023 and up from the $94.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022. The differences between GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Fourth quarter 2023 stock compensation expense, including $1.2 million charge to cost of goods sold was $41.1 million, compared with $33.6 million recorded in the third quarter of 2023. Switching to the bottom line. Fourth quarter 2023, GAAP net income was $96.9 million or $1.98 per fully diluted share, compared with $2.48 per share in the third quarter of 2023 and $2.45 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Q4 2023 non-GAAP net income was $140.9 million or $2.88 per fully diluted share, compared with $3.08 per share in the third quarter of 2023 and $3.17 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q4 2023 were $48.9 million. As for our balance sheet, as of December 31, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.11 billion, compared to $1.04 billion at the end of the third quarter 2023. For the fourth quarter of 2023, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $153.3 million, compared with $175.9 million in Q3 2023. Fourth quarter 2023 capital spending totaled $13.8 million. Accounts receivable ended the fourth quarter of 2023 at $179.9 million, compared with the $185.8 million reported at the end of the third quarter of 2023 and $182.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. There were 36 days of sales outstanding across these comparable periods. Our internal inventories at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 were $383.7 million down from the $397.3 million at the end of the third quarter of 2023. Days of inventory rose to 172 days at the end of Q4 2023 from 171 days at the end of third quarter of 2023. We have carefully managed our internal inventories throughout the year given the uncertainty in the market. Using next quarter revenue as a basis, inventory was 175 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, down from 178 days at the end of the third quarter of 2023. I would now like to turn to our Q1 2024 outlook. We are forecasting Q1 2024 revenue in the range of $437.0 million to $457.0 million. GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.1% to 55.7%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.4% to 56.0%. Total stock-based compensation expense, including associated employer taxes of $46.2 million to $48.2 million, including approximately $1.4 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold. GAAP operating expenses between $147.2 million and $151.2 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $101.8 million to $103.8 million. This estimate excludes stock-based compensation expense and amortization of recently purchased intangible assets, but includes litigation expense and the expense from our recent Axign acquisition. Other income before foreign exchange gains or losses expected to range from $5.3 million to $5.7 million. Fully diluted shares to be in the range of $48.8 million to $49.2 million of shares. We continue to execute the share buyback program that was announced in our Q3 '23 earnings call. Finally, I am pleased to announce a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.25 per share from $1 per share for stockholders of record as of March 29, 2024. In conclusion, while we continue to be cautious about the near-term business conditions, we believe our long-term growth strategy remains intact, and we can swiftly adapt to market changes as they occur. I will now open the webinar up for questions. Yes, we can. Speak up. Sure. I'll take that, Quinn. As far as the initial ramp that we've been experiencing over about the last four quarters, we've really seen or benefited from the acceleration of demand for these applications and solutions. As we look ahead, we see a broadening of the number of market participants or customers that will be participating in that. But at the same time, we also believe that competition within the supply chain will continue. So for a majority of the period to-date, we've enjoyed a pretty high percentage of market share, but expect that to decrease as we introduce second and third suppliers. And one final comment on content is that with each following generation of new products that are being introduced for AI, the power requirements are increasing. And at this point, we have a belief that the dollar content will go up per server. But at this point, it's very hard to gauge that. So I think that there has been some softness that has occurred in Q3 of last -- Q3 and Q4 of last year that was observable both for IC and EVs. And as we said in our earlier comments and it applies to automotive, we don't have great visibility beyond just the next quarter. So it's hard for us to predict with the second-half of \u201824, the ramp might look like for automotive. And Stage 1, for us, at least, is represented about 20%, 25% of the dollar content of Stage 2, and we expect to see the incremental ramp from these products in Q1 and Q2. Matt, I'll take the second question then on the guidance as far as what we're looking at for Q1 here. The growth driver is remains the enterprise data. The positive there is that in addition to AI, we're also seeing incremental positive demand for our traditional CPU data center solutions. When you look at the other groups, you -- basically, we see a flattening in comms, but then we see declines that sort of range between the high single digits and low double digits in the sequential growth between Q4 and Q1 for the other groups. Does that answer your question, Matt. Gen, I think we can move to the next one. And just to give people a refresh of what the model is that Will is referring to is, generally speaking, we outperformed the market by 10 to 15 percentage points and in the stable market conditions where it's growing between about 5% and 8%, it's easy to assume that would be between 15% and 20% growth. On the gross margin or range that we targeted about on a non-GAAP basis, is between 55% and 60%. And then when the environment is more predictable, we look to be able to grow gross margin 10 to 15 percentage points -- or basis points on quarterly successive quarters. But the market contracted 10%. Sure. I can take that one. So as a reminder, the model is days on our balance sheet between 180 to 200 days. We came in at about the low 170s this quarter, which was really a reflection of how we have been managing our inventory in this uncertain environment. Having said that, we've started a lot of wafer starts ahead of what we believe will be a potential upside certainly in the next few quarters. As far as the channel, that's been a difficult aspect of this market for everybody. And we've had our share of putting inventory in the channel, but I'm very happy to report that over the last three quarters, it's been coming down appreciably. And we're right now just a little bit above our model. Yes. And Travis, it's an excellent question because I think to align with Michael's point there is that the strength of MPS as far as resilience in different market conditions, is the breadth of the customer base and not have high levels of concentration. Now obviously, with this environment where it has been generally weak except for AI we're in sort of an unusual profile, but we don't expect that to last over the next couple three years. So I think the way to look at it is that we anticipated softness in the storage market. And so as a result, we became more competitive on notebooks an accepted lower-margin business. And it was offsetting declines, particularly in SSD where we've seen a decline. We increased share with a lot of the major customers in the SSD market, but their business was in decline for much of 2023. And then the other positive in the group is that we saw the initial ramp of DDR5 during the year and also graphic cards expanded pretty nicely during the year. So this is a group that has different characteristics and net-net did pretty okay in a pretty difficult market. Sure. So what really generates interest with our customers is when they see the new product launches at both Intel and AMD ramping and we do the power management for both of those. And I think that as we observed in the last year or even 18 months that the most recent versions of their products have been delayed. And so we've experienced a slower ramp as far as being able to increase share or content on those platforms. But at least initially, is it was observing for Q1 as well as for the balance of '24, we see that both of those ramps starting to improve and that we'll participate with them. At this point, we don't have any reason to doubt our earlier projections as far as overall share opportunity between 20% and 30%. But right at this particular moment, it's hard to say what we have. Great. Thank you very much, everybody. I'd like to thank you for joining us on this conference call, and look forward to talking to you again in our first quarter which will be in late April. And just to add to that, at that time, we'll be introducing a new format for this call. We will provide you content and context on how the end markets have performed in a written manner, and then we will use the conference call portion more for Q&A. So we believe that, that will be a more efficient use of your time and ours and also more complete communication. So with that, I will thank you. And again, I look forward to seeing you again in April."

            "name": "Michael Hsing",
            "content": "Yes. But overall, the overall added -- overall, the market segment is and grow very rapidly. And we're expanding our production lines and we will meet in the second-half for the demand. The dollar content is -- well, it's -- as a market accelerating again, we have more -- our competitor joining and especially this rate of ramp in -- and also, we see other players, other AI players will enter the market that we are so far, we're behind whether pretty much the sole source of power solutions. And as you see the second half or sometime next year, you will see a lot of other players to be qualified or they solve their -- one of the technical problem is, okay, or the odds. So that's what we expect. The cost side, okay, we're always lowering our cost. And at this time, we want to solve all the problems and we believe we resolve all these issues and during this fast ramp. And also the cost at this time is not really the issue. It's all about the throughput and to meet the customer demand. In the next version of it is -- the power is even higher -- is much higher as Bernie said. And we started to do these product developments back in a couple of years ago. And we're about to release it to our customers in this quarter and the next couple of quarters. Good questions, good observation. And towards the end of the last year, it kind of -- auto slowed down. But overall, we as Bernie said earlier, we still grow some high 20%, 30% somewhere in the overall -- in the auto segment. These are mostly primary -- mostly due to the ADS the infotainment or whatever the head units, call it, the digital cockpit. And going for next year we believe we see all the activities and customers and nowadays consuming all these inventories that we shipped and in May or June period times, and now they start to have a higher volume ramp and especially in the EV side. So for this year's first part of this year. Right, the ramp is in the early adoption in EV is very lumpy and a different automakers and ramping in different schedules, I mean -- but overall, the trend is they will pull out more EV with more our products. All right. Yes. This game is always the best performers. So far, our competition, we don't -- I don't want to speak our competition. So far, in what we have, okay, and our customers can be very receptive to our solution. So far, we pretty much have a majority of the volumes. And they keep requesting it and keep requesting we solve all these issues related to their system issues, ours and issues from our side. And -- so when -- even the volume gets even bigger it's good to have another source. Otherwise, again, you don't want the MPS, they can all of them. So again, that's not what we intend to do. And so -- and also the competition in -- it's exactly like a server side. And we are the newcomer in the server market back in -- a couple of years ago, and that's how we win the market. And we had a product long before that. And we also need -- we had to dump the down to meet the common footprints. And because the power density is not high enough. And when this AI come out on the market, the common footprint is not a requirement. So we start to win a lot of -- a lot of shares. And the same is in the servers and have a very similar trend. And that's how we win the market. And we always want to do, as we said in the past. We want to pushing the technology. We want to make sure we're the best. Yes, okay. We had some issues on the Stage 1s and we had some design wins and very small volumes in different systems, actually. And now we don't have -- all these issues are resolved. That will significantly gain the content. And in each AR systems. Yes. We had shipping these products for some of the 48-Volt systems. And also, we supply the -- we are as a supplier for chip and for the silicon, not for the modules. And now we step up the two modules. That's a great question. So otherwise, we are taking to the old AI call. All right. Let me answer your first question. And you said it's inactive in the M&A market. That's not true, okay? And we follow our -- well, it's not really a policy. So we follow what we do for the best for our shareholders. We don't acquire revenue. The reason is cheap to grow revenue for MPS. But we do look -- do apply technology. And so this is the -- in the past, actually, we acquired a field and financially immaterial with our shareholders. And at this time, and it's big enough, we made these disclosures. And to talking about this Axign, is the company that we work with in for three years already. And it's proven that their technology and with our power stage and there will be a huge benefit for -- in audio signal to audio amplification fields. And we have a proven in a very, very, very high-end customers and make these products as a very unique and never achieved in histories that no zero disposing signals and same to speakers. And the cost is very low. The way we achieved that. And also, we achieved a lot of programmable is also software adaptive. And that -- I see it when I listen to those sounds, it's really -- you bring audio first we put in the press release, putting audio quality to everybody's home to lower down -- really low down the cost. And that will revolutionize how we listened. Well, instead of -- well, last year, the growth is not very spectacular. It's like what is a single digit -- 1.5%. Okay. It's -- Yes, okay. But this year, I think is who knows. In last year, we didn't know until ChatGPT happened. Then the AI business took off and was out of our expectations, I mean, we didn't know. But to answer your questions to comment your question 11, what is it, 12 years, 11 years in consecutive year-by-year growth. And it's -- we follow our principles. And again, we want to -- first thing, okay, we want to make sure it's all the product, what we deliver to our customers is the best product, best performers. And we want to beat all our competition. That's number one. Number two is, we react. We react fast, we're nimble, and we fulfill our customer demand. And that's sort of pretty simple strategy that we followed and we kind of disregarded of what the market segment does. And we don't chase those market segments. This year, who knows, okay, with one of the segments and we'll grow, but I don't expect it we'll grow as big as AI, okay? But maybe a couple of small segments happening and I do see that. And we do see that in the recent quarters and the last quarter source and we see all these orders come in and they came in as we expected, those products are truly better than our competitors. Yes. Okay. I think in the next couple of years, and you will see some significant growth from a different area, from a single processing and for data converters and for -- of course, we talk about today and the audio process, and which we're already designing and some consumer -- high-volume consumer market segment. And later, we're going to get into automotive and automotive business. And other ones, we have a lot of small things. A lot of other things like silicon carbides and for silicon carbide projects for green energies for solar -- and for solar inverters. And -- well, these are still kind of power management, but a lot of them, we are other power, and these are for communications. And for communications in between -- in the solar side, okay, so from the inverter side. And even the automotive side back to automotive side, and there's a lot of other communication in the -- within the car, and we'll develop those type of products. And you see MPS in the next few years will migrate out to dose a second to those segments. Thank you. Yes, those kind of models is models and models. And -- but I think the given time and we will be back in a model is the model can be. It's like a weather forecasting, right? we build models and we didn't predict this thunderstorms. And for like the last couple of years, our model is not correct. And either we have too much we too little. So given those kind of economic, whether it's the environment and that model is not quite right. But they end up -- and also, our model is not very scientific either okay, is based on our empirical historical reasons, okay? And -- but we should not deviate from what we see now again. Yes. I might as well added, okay. We emphasize the product development and also the customers design win. And I do see a lot of wins and many different segments I said earlier and probably I forgot even half of it, okay, in my mind. And there are so many things going on. And -- so going in the future and when a normalize -- as Bernie said, is a more normalized economic conditions. And there's no reason we will not grow -- we grow 1.5%, okay? That's at least say it that way, okay. Yes, yes. Okay. Yes. We will start to build inventory. Yes, I see these data we grow our small customer base in -- by a few thousand in last year. And that's kind of exciting. And it doesn't mean we add a lot of revenues. And in the longer term, the wealthy I mean -- the bigger the base, the better it is, the more stable MPS will be. And also, you don't know -- and what's the next hardest things, okay? And our customers will decide that. But the market will decide it. Our customer will take opportunity. If it's not this one, that one well. I mean we just explained that play the percentage. And we just have our products goes out the door. Goes to design in those -- to those customers. And in terms of which segments I have to say it's everywhere. This is okay. The -- I can't remember any numbers more than our grow orders more than five or six things. And -- but that's the beauty you won't go 1,000. I mean that takes a few years and it will turn into bigger revenues. Yes, okay. We are building for $4 billion revenues, again, in capacities. And we -- actually we never changed. And especially out of China, and we -- and that actually fits our plan. and we'll continue to do that. And these kind of capacity issues you look at MPS business. And we see -- we believe these business will grow -- we grow our capacity accordingly. It's really a disregarded, okay, what's the current environment we address for long-term issues. Our module business is -- our -- pure e-commerce, I said it, okay, we didn't know what we are talking about and wasn't that excitement and exciting. But the combination of it and with our web service in the e-commerce and also some interactions help from our website. That generates 150 million units now -- last year. And I can't call it in -- what was that, like seven, eight years ago, seven, eight years ago, we're going to these e-commerce business customers logging our website, we're going to -- they can change their -- they can input their parameters and program our ports, we ship the product within a week or so. That didn't happen that much. But -- and yes, it's happening. But I still believe in the long term, that will be the business because we are loading the power management. We're loading all these product designing barriers. And -- why not? People can program the part and especially younger generations. And they have -- they rather program a product rather than use a solid line, putting us in the arms and get and go to a lab is okay to make it happen. And I think it's longer younger generations would do that. And it will be different from other generations, my generation. And that business I believe in the long-term, we're still picking up. But for now, was more than that bad. I cannot say that way. That's not good. You know, the answer already. And I said, overall, it's not good. Overall, we take on some market shares, and we start to grow a little bit. Well, I think the DDR5, we expect to ramp in last year, right? I mean it happened didn't happen that fast. I mean -- so the key is, again, we make sure our product is designing and when these products will ramp, it's not up to us. And we actually care less but only care is we have a product to ship. Okay. It's not a sore point. It's a reality like everybody else is. Alright, thank you. Yes. Let me talk about this in looking and we didn't have any. And we are 13.5% and because that was about 2.5 years ago, we have a lot of design wins. We have a design win, a few but for me came in the customers -- at their customers, they couldn't get the -- couldn't ship. And we are turning to be the bigger players. We are four teams in -- back in a few years ago, that we're designing a many different projects. And we expect to be a bigger player. And so that's -- we still believe the same story. And when the CPU market picks up and our revenue will start resume to growth. And so what is the last year, and I don't even remember what was the last year, there wasn't spectacular numbers anyway. And I think as soon or later will turn around."

Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, EVP and CFO. In the course of today's webinar, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q3 earnings release and in our latest SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q, which are accessible through our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Tables that outline the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures are included in our Q3 2023 earnings release, which we have furnished to the SEC and is currently available on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.\nBernie Blegen: Thanks, Gen. MPS reported third quarter revenue of $474.9 million, 7.6% higher than the second quarter of 2023 and 4.1% lower than third quarter of 2022. Compared with Q2 2023, sales in enterprise data and storage and computing improved sequentially, while automotive, industrial and communications revenue was lower. Turning now to our third quarter 2023 revenue by market. In our enterprise data market, third quarter 2023 revenue of $98.9 million increased 106.2% from the second quarter of 2023 with sequential growth in both GPU and CPU program sales. Third quarter 2023 enterprise data revenue was up 31.4% year-over-year. Enterprise data revenue represented 20.8% of MPS' third quarter 2023 revenue compared with 15.2% in the third quarter of 2022. Storage and computing revenue of $129.5 million increased 3.9% from the second quarter of 2023. The sequential revenue improvement primarily reflected higher sales in commercial notebooks. Third quarter 2023 storage and computing revenue was up 14.7% year-over-year. Storage and computing revenue represented 27.3% of MPS' third quarter 2023 revenue compared with 22.8% in the third quarter of 2022. Third quarter consumer revenue of $62.4 million decreased 4.3% from the second quarter of 2023 as higher gaming and monitor sales were offset by declines in TV and home appliance revenue. Third quarter 2023 consumer revenue was down 30.1% year-over-year. Consumer revenue represented 13.1% of MPS' third quarter 2023 revenue compared with 18.0% in third quarter of 2022. Third quarter 2023 communications revenue of $46.8 million was down 5.1% from the second quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting lower infrastructure sales. Third quarter 2023 communications revenue was down 35.3% year-over-year. Communications sales represented 9.9% of our total third quarter 2023 revenue compared with 14.6% in the third quarter of 2022. Third quarter automotive revenue of $95.2 million decreased 8.8% from the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower ADAS and digital cockpit sales. Third quarter 2023 revenue was up 9.3% year-over-year. Automotive revenue represented 20.0% of MPS' third quarter 2023 revenue compared with 17.5% in the third quarter of 2022. Third quarter 2023 industrial revenue of $42.1 million decreased 15.3% from the second quarter of 2023 due to lower sales in security and industrial meter applications. Third quarter 2023 revenue was down 28.2% year-over-year. Industrial revenue represented 8.9% of our total third quarter 2023 revenue compared with 11.9% in the third quarter of 2022. I'd like to make some general comments about our business. In our previous earnings calls, we have noted customer ordering patterns were oscillating within the overall market. This environment persisted through Q3. We continue to see some orders getting delayed or amended by pull-in requests. This lack of short-term visibility continues to make forecasting beyond the next quarter difficult. However, as we said in our last call, our business fundamentals remain unchanged. Our design win pipeline and customer base expanded tremendously, particularly amongst Tier 1 accounts. Additionally, we continue to innovate and have a strong design win pipeline position us well for future growth. Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 55.5%, 60 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2023 and 320 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2022. Our GAAP operating income was approximately $135.6 million compared to $112.3 million reported in the second quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter of 2023 was 55.7%, down 80 basis points from the gross margin reported for the second quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin is attributed largely to an unfavorable product mix. Our non-GAAP operating income was $167.8 million compared to $153.1 million reported in the second quarter of 2023. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $128 million in third quarter of 2023 compared with $135.4 million in the second quarter of 2023. Our non-GAAP third quarter 2023 operating expenses were approximately $96.6 million, essentially flat with what we saw in each of the first two quarters of 2023. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the third quarter of 2023, stock compensation expense, including approximately $1 million charged cost of goods sold, was $33.6 million compared with $38 million recorded in the second quarter of 2023. Switching to bottom line. Third quarter 2023 GAAP net income was $121.2 million or $2.48 per fully diluted share compared with $99.5 million or $2.04 per share in the second quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2023 non-GAAP net income was $150.3 million or $3.08 per fully diluted share compared with $137.5 million, or $2.82 per fully diluted share in the second quarter of 2023. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q3 2023 were $48.8 million. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $1.04 billion at the end of third quarter 2023 compared with $941.1 million at the end of the second quarter of 2023. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of approximately $175.9 million compared with Q2 2023 operating cash flow of $90.2 million. Accounts receivable ended the quarter of 2023 at $185.8 million, representing 36 days of sales outstanding, which was one-day higher than the 35 days reported at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2023 were $397.3 million, down from $427.4 million at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Days of inventory of 171 days came in at the end of the third quarter of 2023 were 30 days lower than at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Comparing current inventory levels with following quarter's projected revenue, you can see days of inventory decreased to 180 days at the end of the third quarter of 2023 from 184 days at the end of the second quarter of 2023. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2023. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $442 million to $462 million. GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.2% to 55.8%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.4% to 56%. Total stock-based compensation expense in the range of $32.2 million to $34.2 million, including approximately $1 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold. GAAP operating expenses between $127.1 million to $131.1 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the range of $95.9 million to $97.9 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation expense but includes litigation expense. Interest and other income in the range from $4.1 million to $4.5 million before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares in the range of 48.7 million to 49.1 million shares. We are also pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a share buyback program for up to $640 million over the next 3 years with the goal of offsetting future dilution. In conclusion, while we expect visibility to remain limited in the short term, which was the same as last quarter, we continue to execute on the long-term strategy. I will now open the webinar up for questions.\nA - Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. [Management Instructions] Our first question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.\nQuinn Bolton: Hi. Michael and Bernie, congratulations on the results and the outlook in a tough market. I guess, Bernie, Michael, the enterprise data business is very strong quarter-on-quarter. Wondering if you could just give us some thoughts as you look into next year, how you see the GPU business. And specifically, do you see sort of expansion of that customer list driving strength in GPUs? And then a question on CPU. You said CPU was up in the third quarter. Wondering if you're finally starting to see some strength in the Sapphire Rapids and Genoa side of that business? And then I have a follow-up question. Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: At this time, Quinn, as Bernie said earlier, these markets are very much oscillating and that came in the net, you see it. We done from this quarter. So from last year, year-to-year, we're still down. But AI, as these are power modules and as we're ramping up as a result of -- can maintain growth over in these years and still a slight growth from the last years. That's mainly due to AI. And also in the prior quarters in the autos that we see as a very lumpy business, as lumpy for ADAS ramping up. But all of these, we believe that will happen in ramping up in the next year, not only from ADAS. And also, as you mentioned about on the general CPU and in the server side. And I might as well as mention all the other ones. We still have a lot of greenfield products that haven't really ramped up yet. And many, many projects gets delayed in this year pushing to next year. And we don't want to give a very clear forecast that we still don't know yet. But sometime in the next years, we believe that they will start ramping up and all these greenfield products. So that's kind of my summary for the near-term business.\nQuinn Bolton: Thank you, Michael. I guess a follow-up question. Bernie, I think in the script, you mentioned some pushouts, some pull-ins or expedites. I think the pull-ins or expedites maybe newer given just the overall challenging industry. Were the pull-ins specific to certain customers or end markets or are you starting to see pull-in requests across multiple end markets? Thank you.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. Quinn. I think what we're experiencing here is a unique business cycle and that right now, our end customers are unwilling to commit beyond a fairly lower window of expecting lead times within under 10 weeks for delivery. So that makes, as we said earlier in the comments, the predictability really hard to call right now. But I think, as Michael just said, that when we look at our design win pipeline, it's strong. And we're confident that we're in a good position to capture share and growth as the market recovers. But right now, we're still in a level of unpredictability.\nMichael Hsing: He's talking about which segments.\nBernie Blegen: Oh, I'm sorry. Which segments?\nMichael Hsing: Yes, which segments. We look at it kind of a rough surveys. Like it's actually across the entire product segment, including consumers. Some of the products, they need and pull-it in very quick. As Bernie said, the lead time is very, very short. And we don't have those products, it's pretty much across the board. And other than AI, we really planned ahead, and we really plan ahead from the beginning of the year. And we can anticipate all the ramp-up even for the next few quarters.\nQuinn Bolton: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you, Michael, Bernie. Congratulations on that $1 billion cash balance. First question is on the Q4 outlook. I know you typically don't guide by segment, but can you just talk about directionally where you expect each segment to trend in Q4?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Q4 is still down quite a bit from Q3 and pretty much everything except maybe not auto. I mean all the public sideways are maybe is slightly up and also that AI power still continuously ramp up.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. I think that when you look at the broader market, we're experiencing a lot of the weakness in demand that many of our peer companies are. And what makes us differentiated is the AI boost we're experiencing.\nMichael Hsing: And pretty much AI and auto and everything else is pretty much muted, yes.\nTore Svanberg: Very good. And as my follow-up and maybe related to the previous question on enterprise data and AI, just wondering if you have any visibility on the sustainable growth here. There's obviously one big partner that's ramping right now, but it looks like there's some other processor companies that are going to be catching up next year. So if you could give us any color on, especially enterprise data segment for 2024, that would be really helpful.\nMichael Hsing: I can tell you, overall, how the MPS strategies. Like the MPS strategy always get the best -- which provides the best performance. When the volume gets higher and requirement is lower, we don't chase those low-end segment. I see MPS is still in the forefront in terms of best efficiencies and the lowest generate heat in smallest areas. We are still the leading -- would be next year and the year after, all these products are eyeing in development with our customers and with the leading-edge -- leading providers in AI GPUs specifically. And that's a huge market, and we don't want to take all of them. And to your other part of the question is the general market. In general market, in other segments, we view CPUs. And you'll remember in the VR13, we didn't have a lot of design wins. But we put up a lot of inventories in the VR13.5, it became a serendipity. And again, we have a few project design win and other supply -- but we ship a lot. So that's where you see the server data center growth. That's because of that. And for next years, we were told to get ready to have those projects ramping up in a rapid supply, let's call it. And so when these markets are already ramping up, MPS are there.\nBernie Blegen: I think, Tore, you hit on a couple of very good points that as far as the AI GPU opportunity, we're very well positioned both for the near term, in 2024, but more importantly, longer term. And as Michael just emphasized, there is a differentiated market there and we want to stay at the high end of that market. So we've always been aware that there would be competitors entering this space and that's how we're differentiating ourself. And then as far as the CPU and GPU markets what we're preparing to do is to manage the uptick in demand that we're anticipating by building that inventory during the next couple of quarters.\nMichael Hsing: Oh, yes. That's what I forgot, while I tried to make a point. And MPS doesn't want to be known as AI power company. We want to focus on the diversified growth. And we do have a lot of greenfield products still haven't realized yet. These are across the segment. And also in the consumer side, in the last years, okay, because last couple of years because the shortages we kind of neglect it. And that will -- in the last half years, we developed a low-cost product and we introduced the market where you'll see the growth. That's only on the -- because of very short design cycle, you will see revenue from next year. And all the other product like industrials, automotive, in tracking inverters, in chargers and also ADAS, these were ramping up. And so we want to achieve very diversified growth, not only on the AI side.\nTore Svanberg: Great color. Good job with the buyback. Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.\nRoss Seymore: Hi, guys, can you hear me?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Hi, Ross.\nRoss Seymore: Hi, there guys. So I guess the question I have is, I don't know cyclicality or seasonality is carrying the day. But the last couple of quarters, you've talked about weakness. You're not unique in that. But the fourth quarter, you seem to be guiding pretty much back to a seasonal drop. If I look into the first quarter, is that something that you expect to continue, or is visibility just too limited to really comment on that quite yet.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Well, the numbers kind of reflected seasonal, but the reality is it just happened that way, we can't call it seasonal. This is a fast-changing market, I mean, it's very difficult for us to forecast. That's difficult. Unfortunately, we have a lot of capacities. But these capacity were still the lead time still shorter than our production cycle and we have to get ready just that.\nBernie Blegen: Ross, you bring up a really good point is that if we look at the outlook for Q4, a portion of that is how competitive we were at going after the notebook market. And so the Q4, we're experiencing a little bit of a decline as those are seasonal sales. When we look at Q1, Michael said it best, there isn't a lot of visibility. But as we look at this cycle, we believe that next year is really back half-weighted. And so I would probably indicate that we'll have a more conservative profile as we look at the first half of 2024.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Also, I forgot to mention about it. And we talked about beginning of the year, we'll be aggressive on price and especially within the course of board. And then we have a new product in the consumer segment come out -- already came out. And also in a notebook area, we pretty much have a large market share in the commercial side. In the beginning of the year, we were very starting -- become very aggressive on the price. And now, fourth quarter, you see it in our notebook side start to gain more shares in the consumer side.\nRoss Seymore: Got it. Thanks for that. And my one follow-up, I want to just pivot over to the gross margin side of things. You mentioned, Bernie, in your script that you're at the low end of your guidance because of mix. I was a little surprised that enterprise data more than doubled sequentially, but yet you pointed to mix. Can you just talk a little bit about what's going on? What mix were you referring to because I think, whether correctly or incorrectly, at least I assume that enterprise data would be an accretive gross margin category.\nMichael Hsing: Sure. Well, consumer notebook, margins are very low. But it's an easier money to be made.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. Michael is exactly right, is that we have been aggressive on pricing across the board. And while that isn't called out specifically as a contributing factor to the lower gross margin, it is reflected in the overall mix, notwithstanding the impact of the GPU and AI business.\nRoss Seymore: And has that pricing dynamic, is that starting to kind of normalize from here? Or is that an incremental headwind that we should consider going forward?\nBernie Blegen: I believe that as the market begins to stabilize, that will return to a more normal profile as far as pricing. Again, a very specific point to make here is that most of our customers are attracted and we secured design wins because of our innovation as opposed to pricing alone. So I believe that as the market stabilizes sometime in 2024 that we'll probably return to a more normal pricing environment as well.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. You said product mix, right? But also, there's other capacities, and capacity utilizations in [indiscernible] and also add a lot of capacity cost for us. So it's a mix of all of them, not only the product mix.\nRoss Seymore: Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.\nRick Schafer: Hey, guys. Let me add my congratulations. If I could follow up, just one more question on enterprise data. You mentioned your greenfield product lineup for next year, I think, a couple of times on call. And one of those really stands out is the silicon carbide power isolation module you guys are working on. And I know that's for a couple of different end markets. I was hoping you could give some color around the sort of engagements you're seeing right now with the CSPs, so in data center, maybe a sense of timing of when those initial revenues would start showing up in the model. And my bigger question is really, do you view sort of power isolation module as a TAM expander for your existing enterprise data franchise? Thanks.\nMichael Hsing: Let me answer your first for silicon cover. Thanks for reminding me this. I almost forgot. Yes, we released the product. And first revenue, we'll see sometime in the next years, would be in the solar inverters. And the green energies had a lot of demand, we have got products we designed for those -- that market segment and will start to ramp and also in automotive. And these are not specifically for tracking inverter for these drivers. We do power management. And we will see those products designed and ramping up much later. I mean these are clearly in the dip -- there's a void in the market. No other company produces that kind of a product, and it became very unique. And so I have a very good confidence in the second half of next year, the year after. We will see a lot of new revenue coming from that segment. And what's the second questions, second part of the --\nRick Schafer: Yes. Within CSP, the full rack power that I know you guys have discussed. Is there any color you could give around how you view that? Is that sort of a TAM expander for your enterprise data segment? I'm sorry, the hyperscalers?\nMichael Hsing: Oh, the hyperscaler. Hyperscaler is now -- you guys know better than we do. We just only provide the power. So I can mean that, for the CPU side, GPU side, as we said earlier, VR14, we expect to have bigger shares. And if you refer to silicon carbide in that we will develop those products. Those are power supplies. And again, these are plug-and-play power supply, and these are large modules. And that will ramp up -- I don't have a time frame. Probably is towards the very end of the next year, the 2025.\nRick Schafer: Okay. Thanks a lot for that color, Michael. And I guess, maybe if I could try one more slide that Ross question on gross margin. I don't know, Bernie, if you could give us any kind of rule of thumb. And I understand it's a mix issue and I hear everything you're saying about the current pricing environment. But as we look the thing sort of normalizing, say, in the second half next year, say you get back to your $2 billion or better kind of run rate, I mean, should we be thinking gross margin at that level should be back sort of tilting toward the high 50s again at that sort of a run rate?\nBernie Blegen: Yes. I would not be too quick to jump to the high 50s in the near term here. I think that what we've said previously is that we expect for the next few quarters to stay within our model, targeting about 56% plus or minus 50 basis points. And then, as we look at the second half of next year, as things stabilize and we get a better mix that we should see return to have an incremental improvement.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. I still see some and I didn't look at the number in details. We expand a lot of capacities. And these are strategically not mistake. And we do see a lot of growth in the next couple of years. And so I believe this capacity, the utilization had taken into effect on the gross margins. I don't know how many -- what's the percentage? I don't know. Maybe Bernie can answer you later.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. On the capacity, and I'll take this topic on because it's an important one as we look ahead, is we talked about a year ago as far as developing new relationships with fab partners, particularly in Taiwan and Singapore as we not only expand capacity in advance of a future upswing in demand but also to diversify by geography. And so those investments are adding to our overall cost profile more in the R&D side than in gross margin specifically today, but that capacity will become available here just as we see the second half of next year starting to --\nMichael Hsing: Well, these are for future. China is on --\nBernie Blegen: Yes.\nMichael Hsing: But the capacity that we expanded from a year ago and it's not utilized, yes?\nBernie Blegen: Yes, not yet.\nMichael Hsing: Okay. Or the test equipment.\nRick Schafer: Thanks for all the color guys.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question comes from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open.\nWilliam Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'm hoping Michael, you talked about traction in design wins that will turn into revenue over the next several quarters and years. It sounds like you've been very busy with these, as you always are. And often, that means you can see sort of what's coming a little earlier in terms of where the revenue might shift in terms of the end markets and products and that sort of thing. So when you think about the bigger design wins, either the bigger volume runners or the bigger ASP drivers, is there a shift either in end markets or in mix, let's say, for modules or motion control or things like that? Any other shifts in the revenue mix that we should expect because of these design wins that have yet to ramp?\nMichael Hsing: Well, thanks for reminding me the motion. I forgot about that. Okay, yes, we do have a lot of design win in the motion side, too. And we look at it. And the beauty is, I can't call it specifically, really across the board. And that means we have our biggest customers, like 4%, 5%, maybe slightly higher out of these years. And all the other customers, there are a few thousand customers and a few thousand products around, I don't know how many market segments. And they are very healthy in terms of design win activities. And so all of them will turn into revenues. And I can give you some bigger segments, and not many people talking about it. And is not, what is it, a USB-C, USB-PD. And I believe that this will be a huge revenue and growth. And MPS has a lot more content versus a USB-PD versus the USB --\nBernie Blegen: Earlier versions.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, earlier versions like type B, okay, now it's Type C. And some of them in auto will be cannibalized for USB type B product. And but C is a much higher content, and that's in auto. And in the consumer side, it's totally new. And USB B type is a very low -- is like a consumer side. And now they're converting to USB-C, and that will be a lot broader applications. And it's based on -- because all unified approach, and especially European countries and drive that standards and I think to migrate to everywhere. They have a clear mandate went to switch it. And I believe even Apple on, for the next version of a phone will be USB-C. And we see MPS has a lot of opportunities, a lot of growth. So other than that, battery management and that will ramp in 2014. And again in a lot of different applications from --\nBernie Blegen: 2024.\nMichael Hsing: 2024. And these are from power tool to garden tools and from all kind of other things. I mean those are already designed in products, okay, we're ramping in the next 12 to 24 months or less than 6 to 24 months, I guess, yes.\nBernie Blegen: And in addition, just to repeat sort of the opportunities that we talked about in both green energy, clean energy and as well as in DDR5. So there's a large number of products that are expected to ramp here very quickly for us.\nWilliam Stein: Great. If I can ask one follow-up. The inventory decline sequentially surprised us a bit. Perhaps this was always your plan. But if it wasn't, can you describe what happened here? Perhaps customer came in with more demand for something or maybe you decided mid-quarter to reduce production. What -- maybe just set me straight on this issue.\nMichael Hsing: We reduced the overall inventories that came in starting at the beginning of the year. That's probably reflects that. And yes, and it doesn't mean we will keep that low. We will boost that up more.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. What we've done is, we've said that we have a range of inventory that we want to operate within between 180 to 200 days. And what you've seen is that we did reduce wafer starts about 9 months or 3 quarters ago, and that's now being reflected in our balance sheet today. But as we anticipate the demand for all of the opportunities that we see possible for 2024, we are beginning to ramp inventory. And as Michael said, we have the capacity available to take advantage of that.\nWilliam Stein: Thanks, guys.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matt, your line is open.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. Michael, I wanted to dig into the automotive market a bit and understand the drivers of the business over the next several quarters. I think you guys have some very exciting new content with one of the leading EV OEMs in the States and obviously some really good content with a number of folks in Asia. So if you could try to help us break down what your expectations are for the drivers of your automotive business over the next, I don't know, 6, 9 months relative to some, I'd say, fluctuations in unit expectations from some key customers, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. These type of products is not like a consumers. Like a 0.5 year and you can design you out. And it took us a year -- it took us years and it took us at least 12 months to work with our customers, the major suppliers, and to put in the system and make a production worthy and working. And that's a long effort. And frankly, I don't really care, okay? As long as you win those socket or you win those projects. I mean the revenue will come. And so when is the next 3 months or next 9 months? I don't really know. I mean we thought from the last year, again, we saw the last year, middle of this year, we'll start to ramp up. It didn't. But I think it's next year, sometimes that we'll see more and more ADAS and also the new type of tracking inverters. And so that's pretty much just as everybody else expected. All these products are ramping up, okay, we'll go with it.\nBernie Blegen: And if I can just add to that, that a lot of the customers that are picking up on design wins are skewed more heavily to EVs that are inviting new technology platforms. And that market has slowed in unit volumes observed. But the exciting part of this story is that we see that new platform launches for those customers are in position to ramp in the first half of next year. And we're seeing a proliferation of a broadening of those technologies going into more traditional internal combustion, or IC brands. So I think that the automotive market, while it's difficult to time that our positioning is very secure.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Okay. That's a good point. That ADAS, they start to ramp. We were told at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year and now we were told next years. But all of these are new for us. And in the digital cockpit and also ADAS. So now they tell us early next year. And I don't know I can believe or not. I mean --\nBernie Blegen: We'll see, we'll see.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you, guys. I guess my follow-up question, it's not, to me, the most strategically important part of your business, but I think it has a lot of different benefits is the consumer market in Asia. And I mean Bernie used the cookie jar analogy a number of times over the years. And the consumer market got down to a small enough percentage of your revenue. I think there was an intention to potentially really lean in and try to regrow that business both from a revenue perspective and also, it gives you a lot of flexibilities around growth and margins. And maybe the demand environment is not there today to really lean in and regrow that. But I just wanted to do a pulse check on the strategy, that's still the intention to regrow that business as a percentage of revenue and you feel like you have the product portfolio to go and do that?\nMichael Hsing: The strategy is correct. And as in the last quarter, I said like has dropped to unhealthy positions, way too low. And there's a lot of money to be made. And margin may be lower but it helped the EPS a lot. So the second question is whether we have enough product? We did a lot of them, and that came in last 0.5 years. And other ones will release in next couple of quarters and our next quarter also, and those will turn into revenues in the 0.5 year to 9 months' time.\nBernie Blegen: We remain committed to the consumer marketplace as part of our diversification.\nMichael Hsing: Absolutely. Okay.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you, guys. Have a good afternoon. Appreciate it.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you. I just had two quick follow-ups. First of all, on the buyback, I mean, this is from a size perspective something that's quite large. And we don't have much history with the company in regards to a size like that. So how should we think about, I guess, philosophy with the buyback? You mentioned to offset dilution, but are you going to be opportunistic? Or are you like some other companies where you buy the stock regardless of the price? Just trying to understand some of the dynamics there.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. So I'd like to comment on that very quickly is that when we looked at doing the buyback, we were demonstrating confidence in our free cash flow over the next 3-year window. And the goal here is to offset dilution that will naturally occur during that period of time. So we're going to apply a go-to-market strategy that is both opportunistic but also programmatic. So we don't have a timetable necessarily for how to implement it during that period, but it will reflect both existing market conditions as well as a systematic program.\nMichael Hsing: Well, implies a bylaw, keep it higher, yes.\nTore Svanberg: Yes, that's very helpful. The other follow-up, and I know this is a minor detail, but your lighting control business was up quite a bit in the quarter. Was that mainly because of notebook, or was there something else going on there?\nMichael Hsing: Lighting business?\nBernie Blegen: I'm sorry, Tore, you broke up a little bit. Were you talking about storage and computing?\nTore Svanberg: No, no, no. So you have the lighting control business. I mean you showed this in your filings. It was up about 20% sequentially. And I was just wondering if that was because of notebook or anything else.\nMichael Hsing: No, these are decorate lighting. We don't have a lot of consumer business anymore. But these are small numbers, okay? I mean I don't know that specifically, but I do know we don't have a lot of consumers because these are really, really low price. These are industrial lightings and decorative lighting.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. I apologize, Tore. I think that you broke up and we missed the heart of your question, which end market?\nMichael Hsing: Lighting, he said.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. You have a lighting control versus DC to DC, right? So lighting control, it increased by $4.5 million sequentially. It was [1] [ph]. It's a $100 million annual business. I mean it's not trivial, but obviously, small in the bigger scheme of things.\nMichael Hsing: Yes.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. Again, Michael addressed it, but it's a general market.\nMichael Hsing: I don't know it specifically, but that's the market where we're in. We will position ourself. We're not specifically in the consumer and in high volumes.\nBernie Blegen: And also, it's in automotive as well.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. You're right.\nGenevieve Cunningham: [Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.\nBernie Blegen: Just closing here, I'd like to thank you all for joining us this webinar and I look forward to talking to you again during the fourth quarter, which will likely be at the end of January. Thank you. Have a nice day.",

            "name": "Bernie Blegen",
            "content": "Thanks, Gen. MPS reported third quarter revenue of $474.9 million, 7.6% higher than the second quarter of 2023 and 4.1% lower than third quarter of 2022. Compared with Q2 2023, sales in enterprise data and storage and computing improved sequentially, while automotive, industrial and communications revenue was lower. Turning now to our third quarter 2023 revenue by market. In our enterprise data market, third quarter 2023 revenue of $98.9 million increased 106.2% from the second quarter of 2023 with sequential growth in both GPU and CPU program sales. Third quarter 2023 enterprise data revenue was up 31.4% year-over-year. Enterprise data revenue represented 20.8% of MPS' third quarter 2023 revenue compared with 15.2% in the third quarter of 2022. Storage and computing revenue of $129.5 million increased 3.9% from the second quarter of 2023. The sequential revenue improvement primarily reflected higher sales in commercial notebooks. Third quarter 2023 storage and computing revenue was up 14.7% year-over-year. Storage and computing revenue represented 27.3% of MPS' third quarter 2023 revenue compared with 22.8% in the third quarter of 2022. Third quarter consumer revenue of $62.4 million decreased 4.3% from the second quarter of 2023 as higher gaming and monitor sales were offset by declines in TV and home appliance revenue. Third quarter 2023 consumer revenue was down 30.1% year-over-year. Consumer revenue represented 13.1% of MPS' third quarter 2023 revenue compared with 18.0% in third quarter of 2022. Third quarter 2023 communications revenue of $46.8 million was down 5.1% from the second quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting lower infrastructure sales. Third quarter 2023 communications revenue was down 35.3% year-over-year. Communications sales represented 9.9% of our total third quarter 2023 revenue compared with 14.6% in the third quarter of 2022. Third quarter automotive revenue of $95.2 million decreased 8.8% from the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower ADAS and digital cockpit sales. Third quarter 2023 revenue was up 9.3% year-over-year. Automotive revenue represented 20.0% of MPS' third quarter 2023 revenue compared with 17.5% in the third quarter of 2022. Third quarter 2023 industrial revenue of $42.1 million decreased 15.3% from the second quarter of 2023 due to lower sales in security and industrial meter applications. Third quarter 2023 revenue was down 28.2% year-over-year. Industrial revenue represented 8.9% of our total third quarter 2023 revenue compared with 11.9% in the third quarter of 2022. I'd like to make some general comments about our business. In our previous earnings calls, we have noted customer ordering patterns were oscillating within the overall market. This environment persisted through Q3. We continue to see some orders getting delayed or amended by pull-in requests. This lack of short-term visibility continues to make forecasting beyond the next quarter difficult. However, as we said in our last call, our business fundamentals remain unchanged. Our design win pipeline and customer base expanded tremendously, particularly amongst Tier 1 accounts. Additionally, we continue to innovate and have a strong design win pipeline position us well for future growth. Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 55.5%, 60 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2023 and 320 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2022. Our GAAP operating income was approximately $135.6 million compared to $112.3 million reported in the second quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter of 2023 was 55.7%, down 80 basis points from the gross margin reported for the second quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin is attributed largely to an unfavorable product mix. Our non-GAAP operating income was $167.8 million compared to $153.1 million reported in the second quarter of 2023. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $128 million in third quarter of 2023 compared with $135.4 million in the second quarter of 2023. Our non-GAAP third quarter 2023 operating expenses were approximately $96.6 million, essentially flat with what we saw in each of the first two quarters of 2023. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the third quarter of 2023, stock compensation expense, including approximately $1 million charged cost of goods sold, was $33.6 million compared with $38 million recorded in the second quarter of 2023. Switching to bottom line. Third quarter 2023 GAAP net income was $121.2 million or $2.48 per fully diluted share compared with $99.5 million or $2.04 per share in the second quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2023 non-GAAP net income was $150.3 million or $3.08 per fully diluted share compared with $137.5 million, or $2.82 per fully diluted share in the second quarter of 2023. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q3 2023 were $48.8 million. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $1.04 billion at the end of third quarter 2023 compared with $941.1 million at the end of the second quarter of 2023. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of approximately $175.9 million compared with Q2 2023 operating cash flow of $90.2 million. Accounts receivable ended the quarter of 2023 at $185.8 million, representing 36 days of sales outstanding, which was one-day higher than the 35 days reported at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Our internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of 2023 were $397.3 million, down from $427.4 million at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Days of inventory of 171 days came in at the end of the third quarter of 2023 were 30 days lower than at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Comparing current inventory levels with following quarter's projected revenue, you can see days of inventory decreased to 180 days at the end of the third quarter of 2023 from 184 days at the end of the second quarter of 2023. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2023. We are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of $442 million to $462 million. GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.2% to 55.8%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.4% to 56%. Total stock-based compensation expense in the range of $32.2 million to $34.2 million, including approximately $1 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold. GAAP operating expenses between $127.1 million to $131.1 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the range of $95.9 million to $97.9 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation expense but includes litigation expense. Interest and other income in the range from $4.1 million to $4.5 million before foreign exchange gains or losses. Fully diluted shares in the range of 48.7 million to 49.1 million shares. We are also pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a share buyback program for up to $640 million over the next 3 years with the goal of offsetting future dilution. In conclusion, while we expect visibility to remain limited in the short term, which was the same as last quarter, we continue to execute on the long-term strategy. I will now open the webinar up for questions. Yes. Quinn. I think what we're experiencing here is a unique business cycle and that right now, our end customers are unwilling to commit beyond a fairly lower window of expecting lead times within under 10 weeks for delivery. So that makes, as we said earlier in the comments, the predictability really hard to call right now. But I think, as Michael just said, that when we look at our design win pipeline, it's strong. And we're confident that we're in a good position to capture share and growth as the market recovers. But right now, we're still in a level of unpredictability. Oh, I'm sorry. Which segments? Yes. I think that when you look at the broader market, we're experiencing a lot of the weakness in demand that many of our peer companies are. And what makes us differentiated is the AI boost we're experiencing. I think, Tore, you hit on a couple of very good points that as far as the AI GPU opportunity, we're very well positioned both for the near term, in 2024, but more importantly, longer term. And as Michael just emphasized, there is a differentiated market there and we want to stay at the high end of that market. So we've always been aware that there would be competitors entering this space and that's how we're differentiating ourself. And then as far as the CPU and GPU markets what we're preparing to do is to manage the uptick in demand that we're anticipating by building that inventory during the next couple of quarters. Ross, you bring up a really good point is that if we look at the outlook for Q4, a portion of that is how competitive we were at going after the notebook market. And so the Q4, we're experiencing a little bit of a decline as those are seasonal sales. When we look at Q1, Michael said it best, there isn't a lot of visibility. But as we look at this cycle, we believe that next year is really back half-weighted. And so I would probably indicate that we'll have a more conservative profile as we look at the first half of 2024. Yes. Michael is exactly right, is that we have been aggressive on pricing across the board. And while that isn't called out specifically as a contributing factor to the lower gross margin, it is reflected in the overall mix, notwithstanding the impact of the GPU and AI business. I believe that as the market begins to stabilize, that will return to a more normal profile as far as pricing. Again, a very specific point to make here is that most of our customers are attracted and we secured design wins because of our innovation as opposed to pricing alone. So I believe that as the market stabilizes sometime in 2024 that we'll probably return to a more normal pricing environment as well. Yes. I would not be too quick to jump to the high 50s in the near term here. I think that what we've said previously is that we expect for the next few quarters to stay within our model, targeting about 56% plus or minus 50 basis points. And then, as we look at the second half of next year, as things stabilize and we get a better mix that we should see return to have an incremental improvement. Yes. On the capacity, and I'll take this topic on because it's an important one as we look ahead, is we talked about a year ago as far as developing new relationships with fab partners, particularly in Taiwan and Singapore as we not only expand capacity in advance of a future upswing in demand but also to diversify by geography. And so those investments are adding to our overall cost profile more in the R&D side than in gross margin specifically today, but that capacity will become available here just as we see the second half of next year starting to -- Yes. Yes, not yet. Earlier versions. 2024. And in addition, just to repeat sort of the opportunities that we talked about in both green energy, clean energy and as well as in DDR5. So there's a large number of products that are expected to ramp here very quickly for us. Yes. What we've done is, we've said that we have a range of inventory that we want to operate within between 180 to 200 days. And what you've seen is that we did reduce wafer starts about 9 months or 3 quarters ago, and that's now being reflected in our balance sheet today. But as we anticipate the demand for all of the opportunities that we see possible for 2024, we are beginning to ramp inventory. And as Michael said, we have the capacity available to take advantage of that. And if I can just add to that, that a lot of the customers that are picking up on design wins are skewed more heavily to EVs that are inviting new technology platforms. And that market has slowed in unit volumes observed. But the exciting part of this story is that we see that new platform launches for those customers are in position to ramp in the first half of next year. And we're seeing a proliferation of a broadening of those technologies going into more traditional internal combustion, or IC brands. So I think that the automotive market, while it's difficult to time that our positioning is very secure. We'll see, we'll see. We remain committed to the consumer marketplace as part of our diversification. Yes. So I'd like to comment on that very quickly is that when we looked at doing the buyback, we were demonstrating confidence in our free cash flow over the next 3-year window. And the goal here is to offset dilution that will naturally occur during that period of time. So we're going to apply a go-to-market strategy that is both opportunistic but also programmatic. So we don't have a timetable necessarily for how to implement it during that period, but it will reflect both existing market conditions as well as a systematic program. I'm sorry, Tore, you broke up a little bit. Were you talking about storage and computing? Yes. I apologize, Tore. I think that you broke up and we missed the heart of your question, which end market? Yes. Again, Michael addressed it, but it's a general market. And also, it's in automotive as well. Just closing here, I'd like to thank you all for joining us this webinar and I look forward to talking to you again during the fourth quarter, which will likely be at the end of January. Thank you. Have a nice day."

            "name": "Michael Hsing",
            "content": "At this time, Quinn, as Bernie said earlier, these markets are very much oscillating and that came in the net, you see it. We done from this quarter. So from last year, year-to-year, we're still down. But AI, as these are power modules and as we're ramping up as a result of -- can maintain growth over in these years and still a slight growth from the last years. That's mainly due to AI. And also in the prior quarters in the autos that we see as a very lumpy business, as lumpy for ADAS ramping up. But all of these, we believe that will happen in ramping up in the next year, not only from ADAS. And also, as you mentioned about on the general CPU and in the server side. And I might as well as mention all the other ones. We still have a lot of greenfield products that haven't really ramped up yet. And many, many projects gets delayed in this year pushing to next year. And we don't want to give a very clear forecast that we still don't know yet. But sometime in the next years, we believe that they will start ramping up and all these greenfield products. So that's kind of my summary for the near-term business. He's talking about which segments. Yes, which segments. We look at it kind of a rough surveys. Like it's actually across the entire product segment, including consumers. Some of the products, they need and pull-it in very quick. As Bernie said, the lead time is very, very short. And we don't have those products, it's pretty much across the board. And other than AI, we really planned ahead, and we really plan ahead from the beginning of the year. And we can anticipate all the ramp-up even for the next few quarters. Yes. Q4 is still down quite a bit from Q3 and pretty much everything except maybe not auto. I mean all the public sideways are maybe is slightly up and also that AI power still continuously ramp up. And pretty much AI and auto and everything else is pretty much muted, yes. I can tell you, overall, how the MPS strategies. Like the MPS strategy always get the best -- which provides the best performance. When the volume gets higher and requirement is lower, we don't chase those low-end segment. I see MPS is still in the forefront in terms of best efficiencies and the lowest generate heat in smallest areas. We are still the leading -- would be next year and the year after, all these products are eyeing in development with our customers and with the leading-edge -- leading providers in AI GPUs specifically. And that's a huge market, and we don't want to take all of them. And to your other part of the question is the general market. In general market, in other segments, we view CPUs. And you'll remember in the VR13, we didn't have a lot of design wins. But we put up a lot of inventories in the VR13.5, it became a serendipity. And again, we have a few project design win and other supply -- but we ship a lot. So that's where you see the server data center growth. That's because of that. And for next years, we were told to get ready to have those projects ramping up in a rapid supply, let's call it. And so when these markets are already ramping up, MPS are there. Oh, yes. That's what I forgot, while I tried to make a point. And MPS doesn't want to be known as AI power company. We want to focus on the diversified growth. And we do have a lot of greenfield products still haven't realized yet. These are across the segment. And also in the consumer side, in the last years, okay, because last couple of years because the shortages we kind of neglect it. And that will -- in the last half years, we developed a low-cost product and we introduced the market where you'll see the growth. That's only on the -- because of very short design cycle, you will see revenue from next year. And all the other product like industrials, automotive, in tracking inverters, in chargers and also ADAS, these were ramping up. And so we want to achieve very diversified growth, not only on the AI side. Yes. Hi, Ross. Yes. Well, the numbers kind of reflected seasonal, but the reality is it just happened that way, we can't call it seasonal. This is a fast-changing market, I mean, it's very difficult for us to forecast. That's difficult. Unfortunately, we have a lot of capacities. But these capacity were still the lead time still shorter than our production cycle and we have to get ready just that. Yes. Also, I forgot to mention about it. And we talked about beginning of the year, we'll be aggressive on price and especially within the course of board. And then we have a new product in the consumer segment come out -- already came out. And also in a notebook area, we pretty much have a large market share in the commercial side. In the beginning of the year, we were very starting -- become very aggressive on the price. And now, fourth quarter, you see it in our notebook side start to gain more shares in the consumer side. Sure. Well, consumer notebook, margins are very low. But it's an easier money to be made. Yes. You said product mix, right? But also, there's other capacities, and capacity utilizations in [indiscernible] and also add a lot of capacity cost for us. So it's a mix of all of them, not only the product mix. Let me answer your first for silicon cover. Thanks for reminding me this. I almost forgot. Yes, we released the product. And first revenue, we'll see sometime in the next years, would be in the solar inverters. And the green energies had a lot of demand, we have got products we designed for those -- that market segment and will start to ramp and also in automotive. And these are not specifically for tracking inverter for these drivers. We do power management. And we will see those products designed and ramping up much later. I mean these are clearly in the dip -- there's a void in the market. No other company produces that kind of a product, and it became very unique. And so I have a very good confidence in the second half of next year, the year after. We will see a lot of new revenue coming from that segment. And what's the second questions, second part of the -- Oh, the hyperscaler. Hyperscaler is now -- you guys know better than we do. We just only provide the power. So I can mean that, for the CPU side, GPU side, as we said earlier, VR14, we expect to have bigger shares. And if you refer to silicon carbide in that we will develop those products. Those are power supplies. And again, these are plug-and-play power supply, and these are large modules. And that will ramp up -- I don't have a time frame. Probably is towards the very end of the next year, the 2025. Yes. I still see some and I didn't look at the number in details. We expand a lot of capacities. And these are strategically not mistake. And we do see a lot of growth in the next couple of years. And so I believe this capacity, the utilization had taken into effect on the gross margins. I don't know how many -- what's the percentage? I don't know. Maybe Bernie can answer you later. Well, these are for future. China is on -- But the capacity that we expanded from a year ago and it's not utilized, yes? Okay. Or the test equipment. Well, thanks for reminding me the motion. I forgot about that. Okay, yes, we do have a lot of design win in the motion side, too. And we look at it. And the beauty is, I can't call it specifically, really across the board. And that means we have our biggest customers, like 4%, 5%, maybe slightly higher out of these years. And all the other customers, there are a few thousand customers and a few thousand products around, I don't know how many market segments. And they are very healthy in terms of design win activities. And so all of them will turn into revenues. And I can give you some bigger segments, and not many people talking about it. And is not, what is it, a USB-C, USB-PD. And I believe that this will be a huge revenue and growth. And MPS has a lot more content versus a USB-PD versus the USB -- Yes, earlier versions like type B, okay, now it's Type C. And some of them in auto will be cannibalized for USB type B product. And but C is a much higher content, and that's in auto. And in the consumer side, it's totally new. And USB B type is a very low -- is like a consumer side. And now they're converting to USB-C, and that will be a lot broader applications. And it's based on -- because all unified approach, and especially European countries and drive that standards and I think to migrate to everywhere. They have a clear mandate went to switch it. And I believe even Apple on, for the next version of a phone will be USB-C. And we see MPS has a lot of opportunities, a lot of growth. So other than that, battery management and that will ramp in 2014. And again in a lot of different applications from -- 2024. And these are from power tool to garden tools and from all kind of other things. I mean those are already designed in products, okay, we're ramping in the next 12 to 24 months or less than 6 to 24 months, I guess, yes. We reduced the overall inventories that came in starting at the beginning of the year. That's probably reflects that. And yes, and it doesn't mean we will keep that low. We will boost that up more. Yes. These type of products is not like a consumers. Like a 0.5 year and you can design you out. And it took us a year -- it took us years and it took us at least 12 months to work with our customers, the major suppliers, and to put in the system and make a production worthy and working. And that's a long effort. And frankly, I don't really care, okay? As long as you win those socket or you win those projects. I mean the revenue will come. And so when is the next 3 months or next 9 months? I don't really know. I mean we thought from the last year, again, we saw the last year, middle of this year, we'll start to ramp up. It didn't. But I think it's next year, sometimes that we'll see more and more ADAS and also the new type of tracking inverters. And so that's pretty much just as everybody else expected. All these products are ramping up, okay, we'll go with it. Yes. Okay. That's a good point. That ADAS, they start to ramp. We were told at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year and now we were told next years. But all of these are new for us. And in the digital cockpit and also ADAS. So now they tell us early next year. And I don't know I can believe or not. I mean -- The strategy is correct. And as in the last quarter, I said like has dropped to unhealthy positions, way too low. And there's a lot of money to be made. And margin may be lower but it helped the EPS a lot. So the second question is whether we have enough product? We did a lot of them, and that came in last 0.5 years. And other ones will release in next couple of quarters and our next quarter also, and those will turn into revenues in the 0.5 year to 9 months' time. Absolutely. Okay. Well, implies a bylaw, keep it higher, yes. Lighting business? No, these are decorate lighting. We don't have a lot of consumer business anymore. But these are small numbers, okay? I mean I don't know that specifically, but I do know we don't have a lot of consumers because these are really, really low price. These are industrial lightings and decorative lighting. Lighting, he said. Yes. I don't know it specifically, but that's the market where we're in. We will position ourself. We're not specifically in the consumer and in high volumes. Yes. You're right."

Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. In the course of today's webinar, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the safe harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on February 24, 2023, and our Form 10-Q filed on May 5, 2023, which are accessible through our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes, net income, and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Tables that outline the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures are included in our Q2 2023 earnings release, which we have furnished to the SEC and is currently available on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for one year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.\nBernie Blegen: Thanks, Gen. MPS reported second quarter revenue of $441.1 million, 2.2% lower than the first quarter of 2023 and 4.3% lower than the second quarter of 2022. Compared with Q1 2023, sales and communications were lower, while industrial, storage and computing, consumer and enterprise data improved sequentially. Turning now to our second quarter 2023 revenue by market. Storage and computing revenue of $124.5 million increased 3.9% from the first quarter of 2023. The sequential revenue improvement primarily reflected higher commercial notebook sales. Second quarter 2023 storage and computing revenue was up 1.8% year-over-year. Storage and computing revenue represented 28.2% of MPS' second quarter 2023 revenue, compared with 26.5% in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter 2023 industrial revenue of $49.7 million increased 4.8% from the first quarter of 2023, reflecting increased sales of products for power source and industrial meter applications. Second quarter 2023 industrial revenue was down 11.0% year-over-year. Industrial revenue represented 11.3% of our total second quarter 2023 revenue, compared with 12.1% in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter consumer revenue of $65.2 million increased 2.9% from the first quarter of 2023. The sequential quarterly revenue improvement reflected higher gaming, TV and mobile device sales. Second quarter 2023 consumer revenue was down 33.0% year-over-year. Consumer revenue represented 14.8% of MPS' second quarter 2023 revenue, compared with 21.1% in the second quarter of 2022. In our enterprise data market, second quarter 2023 revenue of $48.0 million increased 1.7% from the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to initial shipments of new generation AI applications, which offset softer demand for CPU applications. Second quarter 2023 enterprise data revenue was down 26.4% year-over-year. Enterprise data revenue represented 10.9% of MPS' second quarter 2023 revenue, compared with 14.2% in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter automotive revenue of $104.4 million decreased 0.9% from the first quarter of 2023. Second quarter 2023 automotive revenue was up 71.1% year-over-year. Automotive revenue represented 23.6% of MPS' second quarter 2023 revenue, compared with 13.2% in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter 2023 communications revenue of $49.3 million was down 27.4% from the first quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting lower infrastructure sales. Second quarter 2023 communications revenue was down 16.9% year-over-year. Communications sales represented 11.2% of our total second quarter 2023 revenue, compared with 12.9% in the second quarter of 2022. I'd like to make some general comments about our business. In our previous earning calls, we have noted customer ordering patterns could oscillate. This has turned out to be the case. We continue to see some orders getting delayed or amended by [pull-in] (ph) requests. This lack of short-term visibility has made forecasting beyond Q3 2023 more difficult. However, our business fundamentals remain unchanged. In the last few years, our revenue and customer base have expanded tremendously, particularly amongst Tier 1 accounts. We believe we've solidified our market share gains by delivering quality products and services. Additionally, we have a strong design win pipeline, which positions us well for future growth. Here are a few highlights -- here are a few of our recent highlights. We have been designated a preferred supplier with multiple Tier 1 customers in automotive and telecom markets. We have started sampling silicon carbide power solutions for data centers and green energy conversion. We are also continuing development for EV power management applications. We are continuing to broaden our customer base for AI applications and developing solutions for next-generation platforms. We have new design wins in battery management solutions and USB-PD for automotive, industrial and consumer applications. These will be major revenue drivers as we look ahead to 2024 and 2025. Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 56.1%, 120 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2023 and 260 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2022. Our GAAP operating income was $112.3 million, compared to $124.3 million reported in the first quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2023 was 56.5%, down 120 basis points from the gross margin reported in the first quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin is attributed largely to unfavorable variances and higher direct expenses. Our Q2 2023 non-GAAP operating income was $153.1 million, compared to $164.1 million reported in the first quarter of 2023. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $135.4 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared with $134.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. Our non-GAAP second quarter 2023 operating expenses were $96.0 million, matching what was reported in the first quarter of 2023. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the second quarter of 2023, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $1.1 million charged to cost of goods sold, was $38.0 million, compared with $37.0 million recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Switching to the bottom line. Second quarter 2023 GAAP net income was $99.5 million or $2.04 per fully diluted share, compared with $109.8 million or $2.26 per share in the first quarter of 2023. Second quarter 2023 non-GAAP net income was $137.5 million or $2.82 per fully diluted share, compared with $146.0 million or $3.00 per fully diluted share in the first quarter of 2023. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q2 2023 were 48.8 million. Now, let's look at balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $941.1 million at the end of the second quarter of 2023, compared to $919.1 million at the end of the first quarter of 2023. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of approximately $90.2 million, compared with Q1 2023 operating cash flow of $218.8 million. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter of 2023 at $169.2 million, representing 35 days of sales outstanding, which was two days lower than the 37 days reported at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter of 2023 were $427.4 million, down from the $430.8 million at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Days of inventory of 201 days at the end of the second quarter of 2023 were three days lower than at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's projected revenue, you can see days of inventory decreased to 184 days at the end of the second quarter of 2023 from 203 days at the end of the first quarter of 2023. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2023. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in the range of $464 million to $484 million; GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.5% to 56.1%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.7% to 56.3%; total stock-based compensation expense in the range of $33.5 million to $35.5 million, including approximately $1.0 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold; GAAP operating expenses between $129.4 million and $133.4 million; non-GAAP operating expenses in the range of $96.9 million to $98.9 million, this estimate excludes stock compensation expense, but includes litigation expense; interest and other income in the range of $3.0 million to $3.4 million before foreign exchange gains or losses; fully diluted shares in the range of 48.6 million to 49.0 million shares. In conclusion, we continue to execute our long-term strategy. I will now open the webinar for questions.\nA - Genevieve Cunningham: Thank you, Bernie. Analyst, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please click on the Participants icon on the menu bar and then click the Raise Hand button. Our first question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.\nRoss Seymore: Thanks for letting me ask a question. Just wanted to ask Bernie first, when you had your general business condition update about orders remaining volatile, et cetera, I wonder if you could just give us a little more color. Are things kind of improving, staying the same? And is there any changes in things like competitive intensity, pricing, geographic differences? Any color, a little bit more detail than what you gave on your original preamble?\nBernie Blegen: Sure, I'd be glad to help out with that. So, I think that we started that part of the conversation by acknowledging that in each of the last -- the prior three quarters that we believe that ordering patterns would oscillate. And that's pretty consistent when you're coming off of a period where there'd been an extra normal level of ordering that created a demand supply imbalance that afterwards, you're sort of draining your backlog as you are watching your customers try to align around what they're guessing is end customer demand. So, as a result of that, we have not had the same level of visibility out past 90 to 120 days that we would have during the more normal ordering pattern. And so, as a result of that, we don't have the same level of predictability. On the second half of your question, the one thing that remains consistent, whether it's under normal conditions or whether it's today, is we've always been in a very competitive marketplace. And, obviously, price downs are the norm and that we have competitors like ourselves that are trying to go after as much incremental business during this transitory period as is possible.\nMichael Hsing: Let me add, too. We do see a slight improvement in first quarters, and essentially, it's similar. And we do see the consumer business improvement and -- from both -- from U.S. [side] (ph) to Asia side, and other ones, pretty much stay the same.\nRoss Seymore: Great. Thanks for that. I guess as my follow-up, Bernie, you guys have had relatively volatile end markets, not specific to you, but just in a general sense. So, any sort of color in your guide for the third quarter between the various end markets? And the one I think most people are most interested in albeit still a relatively smaller part of your business is your enterprise data segment. Any sort of color between the AI side, you talked about last for the second quarter, and the CPU side, which has been a little bit weaker?\nMichael Hsing: Yes, you already answered your -- all your questions there. We don't see -- we are -- all the products relate to -- with the AI, like, we cannot ship enough now. And the other ones -- other part of enterprise data, it's like data centers, CPU powers, and these are still delayed.\nBernie Blegen: Yeah. And one other thing to add, and this is specific to MPS, not necessarily a broader comment at the general market, but automotive came in a little bit lower than would have been expected. And as we look at the ramp in the second half, we're observing that at least for two of our customers, unit volumes appear to be lower, and we had two product launches which have been delayed into Q4 and to Q1.\nRoss Seymore: Thanks, guys.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.\nQuinn Bolton: Hey, Michael and Bernie. I just wanted to ask on the GPU side of the business. There's been recent chatter in the market that one of your large customers maybe bringing in Renesas as a second source as well as potentially Vicor. Just wondering if you might share any thoughts you have as you look forward with that customer about the impact of multi-sourcing with that customer? And maybe a related question, how are you feeling about your position looking into the next generation 3-nanometer processor at that customer? And then, I've got a follow-up. Thanks.\nMichael Hsing: Okay. I think, so far, we're in the lead position. And I can't -- we are engaged deeply in the future design, and develop a new product for the second generations for the other -- next generations. And so, other than that, we can't speculate any things, okay?\nBernie Blegen: I think in most scenarios and this particular customer's representative is they want to take a leadership position through innovation, and they found us an equal partner for that. But it's in everybody's best interest that it'd be a competitive, not a single source. And so, yes, we'd always anticipated that there would be redesigns that allow competition into the market.\nMichael Hsing: Either as a -- we had to provide the best solution, and at the same time, we understand that our customers require other solutions. This is a very large market. There's no means an MPS can supply everything. And, also, MPS is always -- we emphasize diversified growth. And if there's a performance need, I believe the MPS is the best solution now for the near future.\nQuinn Bolton: Thank you, Michael. Bernie, you'd mentioned sort of visibility out beyond 90 to 120 days is pretty choppy at this point just given the industry dynamics. I guess I look out to the fourth quarter, and it looks like the Street has modeled the fourth quarter approximately flat, which I think is an above seasonal pattern for MPS historically. And I'm just wondering can you comment whether you think an above seasonal fourth quarter looks right to you, perhaps given the ramp in the GPU business and some of the timing shifts you just mentioned in automotive? Or do you think it would be best for investors to think that the December quarter is going to see a -- sort of a seasonal decline in the December quarter? Thank you.\nBernie Blegen: Yeah. I think that normal seasonality for MPS would be somewhere between a sequential decline of between 4 percentage points and 5 percentage points. And I can point to the increase in the notebook sales during Q3, which precedes Christmas, so that's a normal seasonal factor that's expected to come down. And we're not seeing the uplift that had been anticipated from automotive. So, I would be more comfortable with a seasonal down in Q4.\nMichael Hsing: Well, it's a -- you mentioned as a seasonality -- well, we're talking about seasonality, and I try to figure out what is seasonality now. And last year, we -- last couple of years, we have a very strong Q4, at least the year before that. And the customers see all those shortages, and now the demand is -- clearly is much less. And so, you have a -- we experienced, like, a year-over-year, so like a -- in the last couple years, like, over 40%. And this year, and it clearly is not as much, okay? I mean, much less. And I can't really call it seasonality anymore. So, just as I said, it's not very clear. But as Bernie said, usually in a seasonality, we're lowered.\nQuinn Bolton: Understood. Thank you, Michael. Thank you, Bernie.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.\nRick Schafer: Thanks. Yeah, guys, I just had a couple questions if I could. The first one is a -- if I could kind of maybe revisit auto for a second. I mean, you mentioned power isolation module in your prepared remarks. And I don't know if you could give us a little bit more color there. Like, kind of an update on how many customers are evaluating the product now? Talk a little bit about if you could, like, design win timing, revenue timing, kind of expectation there? And is auto going to be the first to ramp and then data center and then more of the green stuff? Or how does it all kind of shake out, I guess, is what I'm asking.\nMichael Hsing: Yeah, that [we saw] (ph) delay a little bit, but we will reintroduce to resampling and announce, and it was a delay due to the technical issues. And so, as speaking right now, we have resampled it. And mostly, it's in automotive and also data centers. And same as we mentioned earlier, the silicon carbides and -- these are product that we'll start to sample.\nRick Schafer: Okay. Thanks, Michael. And then, second question is you guys have almost $2 billion power management business now. And I think modules are on track to be 10% of that or so this year. And I think that's up from basically nothing just a couple of years ago. So, if this business sort of has, I believe, and Bernie, I'm sure correct me, in lighter better margins, I think, the core average, I think it's a 5x ASP multiplier. I'm just trying to get a sense of -- Michael, how big do you envision this business becoming as a percent of mix going forward? And are there any particular end markets that are going to be favored, at least initially, by the move into modules? Thanks.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Okay. I believe that's our future. And when customers want to have a plug-in-play solutions and they want a less technically involved with power management, and that's -- module solution is the way to go. People doesn't want to buy ICs, design all of -- all these up -- the component. And, initially, that's where we're ramping a lot of them in the auto business, in the industrials, that can be an industrial site, and as well as a telecom, and -- or even semi equipment. And a lot of -- I can give -- go on and on, like, a lot of things to be mentioned. But most of all these products is not price sensitive, and they're not volume consumer-related product. And so, this is still at the very beginning. We have all these customer base, and we have all the new product coming out, and we'll see the similar growth rate in next few years.\nRick Schafer: Got it. Thanks, Michael.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Jeremy Kwan of Stifel. Jeremy, your line is now open.\nJeremy Kwan: Thank you. Yes, this is Jeremy on for Tore. I guess maybe a first question on the comms business. It was down meaningfully as you guys expected, and we're probably one of the early ones to call out last quarter. I guess what's your sense of where things are now? Should we expect this business to kind of sort of bounce along at these levels in the second half before maybe picking up next year? And what are your customers telling you in terms of their expectations?\nMichael Hsing: Yeah, as you see, we didn't participate at 4Gs. And 5Gs and other infrastructure business, all new to us. And so, you know that 5G hasn't really ramped up quickly yet. But our products in -- were designed in last few years, we're just waiting for our customers to give us orders. And so far, it's not clear. Okay. Next question?\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open.\nWilliam Stein: Hey. There we go. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I'm hoping you can talk to us about channel inventory. When we look at your P&L, you had nearly 50% revenue growth last year. I think there's a lot of -- there's a pretty strong sense among investors that there might be some inventory still in the channel to be worked through. We'd love to hear any update or any measurement you have of that?\nBernie Blegen: Sure. So, as far as what we observed in Q2 is that there was a meaningful decrease in channel inventories both in terms of dollars and days. And the sort of phenomena that we've seen has been a time delay between when the end customer places an order and when they want to do a pullback because of uncertainty with what end customer demand has been. So, I can point to a couple of our end markets where that was very clear. But we believe right now that we're in a position to continue to bring -- to normalize channel inventories over the next two quarters.\nWilliam Stein: So, not normalized yet, so -- is what it sounds like. So, in the September for guidance, I assume there's some expectation that sell-in will be lower than sell-through. Is that fair?\nBernie Blegen: Yeah. Again, going back to the comments about the visibility and predictability out past 90 or 120 days, that's not just the demand that -- the new net orders that we're receiving, but also the strength of the sell-through is also a little harder to predict.\nWilliam Stein: Great. Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cohen. Matt, your line is now open.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Michael, Bernie, can you guys hear me okay?\nMichael Hsing: Yes.\nMatt Ramsay: Awesome. So, I guess for my first question, Michael, we've -- you and I've had some conversations about the company strategically wanting to sort of rebuild the consumer business as a percentage of revenue over time and get it back to a higher level than it's been now. I guess I'd like to revisit some of those conversations and just see if you had any comments about how you feel about supply, the demand environment, and the competitive environment in order to try to push to sort of reemphasize your company and certain parts strategically of that consumer segment. Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: Yeah. So, that's a good question. So, now we see some improvement, but this is at the beginning. And, as we see our supply, the cost went down dramatically, and as Bernie said, our inventory values even -- I mean, it will reflect inventory value now. And so, in the past, MPS is named in the price killers. It's a very simple game. We don't mind, and we don't buy in that consumer segments and we have a fight. And all the high gross margins is on the other segments. And it's all because they share our technology strengths. We provide a much better, a much smaller size. And in a consumer segment, in the last couple of years, we neglected that, and -- because we don't have enough revenues -- or enough capacities. And so, it's not that difficult to go back to the same games that we played since IPOed.\nMatt Ramsay: Thanks, Michael. I think as my follow-up question, I wanted to really focus on the enterprise data segment just because that's where a large percentage of my investor questions come from. And I think there's two dynamics going on here, right, the strength of the AI business with your lead customer there, and some softness in the CPU market that's well documented. And so, the question is really what would you guys, I think, have built on books inventory to support ramps of all the customers in that space? So, I guess the question is, how quickly and what would the lead times be to respond to an uptick in demand? And do you have any visibility into the timing of a potential reacceleration of that segment? And how long is that visibility? Thanks.\nMichael Hsing: Our visibility is okay, probably is well documented. If you're listening to all these major AIs, [probably you will see] (ph) MPS. And you will see that MPS in the next few quarters of a potential. And -- but I can talk to you about technical issues. I think that the MPS is so far the solutions is far better than our competitor. So, we -- in a -- for the next generation of our AI processor, we're not working on now, we're working a year ago, even 18 months ago. And -- so the relationship is a strong and, also, for the technical reason, even more challenging. And the space is critical, and you had to radiate all the heat out. And for the next generation, power even higher. And so, we provide all these vertical solutions, and we pioneer with it. And all the other solution had to fit into the form in a form factors. And the integrated solution is the only way to go.\nBernie Blegen: And I think if I could just add to that, it's also the breadth of the customer opportunities that we're engaged with. And over the course of the next four quarters, we're going to see multiple new customer applications launch initially with MPS. So, yes, we have a very powerful initial position with one customer, but we expect to branch that out very quickly.\nMichael Hsing: It was multiple customers.\nBernie Blegen: Multiple customers.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you, guys. Really appreciate it.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt. Hans, your line is now open. Our next question is from Jeremy Kwan of Stifel. Jeremy, your line is now open.\nJeremy Kwan: Yes. Hi. Thank you for allowing me a follow-up here. I guess, I wanted to ask about capacity. You guys have always been very ahead of curve on long-term capacity and through up and down cycles. I was wondering how you're thinking about it in this environment and whether or not that may give you guys a competitive advantage in some of these applications that you're really targeting? And, also, if you have a CapEx number for this quarter? Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: Yeah. As we stated it earlier, many of our customers requested move out of China. And now we kind of achieved more than 50%. We can have more than 50% of our capability out of China. And so, the overall capacities, we don't have it. Problem now is, we have more inventories, and we want to sell more from our inventory. And -- does that answer your questions?\nBernie Blegen: Yeah. And I think that when you look at capacity today, it's really when this environment turns around and becomes more predictable, how are we positioned to service our customers a year and two years from now. And I think the investments that we're making, both in terms of expanding capacity and diversifying it geographically, both on the front-end and the back-end will pay very good dividends as far as customer satisfaction.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Chris Caso of Wolfe. Chris, your line is now open.\nChris Caso: Yes. Thank you. Good evening. First question is regarding order visibility. And I ask because for the past several quarters, there really hasn't been any requirement for turns business going forward. Is that something that's changing going forward, given some of the changes in the end markets? And what does that mean with regard to revenue visibility as we look out at over the next few quarters?\nBernie Blegen: Sure. I think that Michael responded to this pretty nicely in that we saw some improvement in Q2 from Q1 as far as our net bookings, but it's still not to the degree that we historically enjoyed in either 2018 or 2020, just to pick two more recent years. In the past, we would have up to 90%, 95% of our next quarter's revenue in hand at the end of the preceding quarter. And so, you're only relying on a fraction of a percent in order to -- of turns business in order to accomplish the numbers for that particular quarter. So, we're seeing steady improvement, but we're still not at the level yet where we have that predictability.\nChris Caso: Got it. Thank you. As a follow-up, I just had a follow-up question about supply, and I understand that that supply is getting a bit easier out there. Historically, I think your ability to procure supply from places different from your competitor has been a source of competitive advantage for Monolithic Power. How do you see the landscape going forward? I know you bringing on some different foundry partners as you try to diversify outside of China. What do you think that means for both your access to wafers over the long term as well as the pricing? Do you think that competitive advantage remains?\nMichael Hsing: Well, you're mentioning of pricing, of course, all these material costs is a much lower than -- or go back to normal, I should say, to -- as pre-pandemic. And so, in terms of a capacities, look, I didn't mention earlier, we want to expand out of China, that's from our customers' request. And the other one is we want to expand it because just for our next couple of years' growth. And mostly, we we're still in a -- follow our long-term plan, and we invest, of course, now which will slow down a little bit in the next few quarters, and -- but over the long term, so we should spin -- we should continue the course.\nChris Caso: Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: If there are any follow-up questions, please click the Raise Hand button. As there are no further questions, I would like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.\nBernie Blegen: Thanks again, Gen. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this webinar, and look forward to talking to you again during our third quarter webinar, which will likely be at the end of October. Thank you, and have a nice day.",

            "name": "Bernie Blegen",
            "content": "Thanks, Gen. MPS reported second quarter revenue of $441.1 million, 2.2% lower than the first quarter of 2023 and 4.3% lower than the second quarter of 2022. Compared with Q1 2023, sales and communications were lower, while industrial, storage and computing, consumer and enterprise data improved sequentially. Turning now to our second quarter 2023 revenue by market. Storage and computing revenue of $124.5 million increased 3.9% from the first quarter of 2023. The sequential revenue improvement primarily reflected higher commercial notebook sales. Second quarter 2023 storage and computing revenue was up 1.8% year-over-year. Storage and computing revenue represented 28.2% of MPS' second quarter 2023 revenue, compared with 26.5% in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter 2023 industrial revenue of $49.7 million increased 4.8% from the first quarter of 2023, reflecting increased sales of products for power source and industrial meter applications. Second quarter 2023 industrial revenue was down 11.0% year-over-year. Industrial revenue represented 11.3% of our total second quarter 2023 revenue, compared with 12.1% in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter consumer revenue of $65.2 million increased 2.9% from the first quarter of 2023. The sequential quarterly revenue improvement reflected higher gaming, TV and mobile device sales. Second quarter 2023 consumer revenue was down 33.0% year-over-year. Consumer revenue represented 14.8% of MPS' second quarter 2023 revenue, compared with 21.1% in the second quarter of 2022. In our enterprise data market, second quarter 2023 revenue of $48.0 million increased 1.7% from the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to initial shipments of new generation AI applications, which offset softer demand for CPU applications. Second quarter 2023 enterprise data revenue was down 26.4% year-over-year. Enterprise data revenue represented 10.9% of MPS' second quarter 2023 revenue, compared with 14.2% in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter automotive revenue of $104.4 million decreased 0.9% from the first quarter of 2023. Second quarter 2023 automotive revenue was up 71.1% year-over-year. Automotive revenue represented 23.6% of MPS' second quarter 2023 revenue, compared with 13.2% in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter 2023 communications revenue of $49.3 million was down 27.4% from the first quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting lower infrastructure sales. Second quarter 2023 communications revenue was down 16.9% year-over-year. Communications sales represented 11.2% of our total second quarter 2023 revenue, compared with 12.9% in the second quarter of 2022. I'd like to make some general comments about our business. In our previous earning calls, we have noted customer ordering patterns could oscillate. This has turned out to be the case. We continue to see some orders getting delayed or amended by [pull-in] (ph) requests. This lack of short-term visibility has made forecasting beyond Q3 2023 more difficult. However, our business fundamentals remain unchanged. In the last few years, our revenue and customer base have expanded tremendously, particularly amongst Tier 1 accounts. We believe we've solidified our market share gains by delivering quality products and services. Additionally, we have a strong design win pipeline, which positions us well for future growth. Here are a few highlights -- here are a few of our recent highlights. We have been designated a preferred supplier with multiple Tier 1 customers in automotive and telecom markets. We have started sampling silicon carbide power solutions for data centers and green energy conversion. We are also continuing development for EV power management applications. We are continuing to broaden our customer base for AI applications and developing solutions for next-generation platforms. We have new design wins in battery management solutions and USB-PD for automotive, industrial and consumer applications. These will be major revenue drivers as we look ahead to 2024 and 2025. Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 56.1%, 120 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2023 and 260 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2022. Our GAAP operating income was $112.3 million, compared to $124.3 million reported in the first quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2023 was 56.5%, down 120 basis points from the gross margin reported in the first quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin is attributed largely to unfavorable variances and higher direct expenses. Our Q2 2023 non-GAAP operating income was $153.1 million, compared to $164.1 million reported in the first quarter of 2023. Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $135.4 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared with $134.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. Our non-GAAP second quarter 2023 operating expenses were $96.0 million, matching what was reported in the first quarter of 2023. The difference between non-GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the second quarter of 2023, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $1.1 million charged to cost of goods sold, was $38.0 million, compared with $37.0 million recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Switching to the bottom line. Second quarter 2023 GAAP net income was $99.5 million or $2.04 per fully diluted share, compared with $109.8 million or $2.26 per share in the first quarter of 2023. Second quarter 2023 non-GAAP net income was $137.5 million or $2.82 per fully diluted share, compared with $146.0 million or $3.00 per fully diluted share in the first quarter of 2023. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q2 2023 were 48.8 million. Now, let's look at balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $941.1 million at the end of the second quarter of 2023, compared to $919.1 million at the end of the first quarter of 2023. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of approximately $90.2 million, compared with Q1 2023 operating cash flow of $218.8 million. Accounts receivable ended the second quarter of 2023 at $169.2 million, representing 35 days of sales outstanding, which was two days lower than the 37 days reported at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Our internal inventories at the end of the second quarter of 2023 were $427.4 million, down from the $430.8 million at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Days of inventory of 201 days at the end of the second quarter of 2023 were three days lower than at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's projected revenue, you can see days of inventory decreased to 184 days at the end of the second quarter of 2023 from 203 days at the end of the first quarter of 2023. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2023. We are forecasting Q3 revenue in the range of $464 million to $484 million; GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.5% to 56.1%; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.7% to 56.3%; total stock-based compensation expense in the range of $33.5 million to $35.5 million, including approximately $1.0 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold; GAAP operating expenses between $129.4 million and $133.4 million; non-GAAP operating expenses in the range of $96.9 million to $98.9 million, this estimate excludes stock compensation expense, but includes litigation expense; interest and other income in the range of $3.0 million to $3.4 million before foreign exchange gains or losses; fully diluted shares in the range of 48.6 million to 49.0 million shares. In conclusion, we continue to execute our long-term strategy. I will now open the webinar for questions. Sure, I'd be glad to help out with that. So, I think that we started that part of the conversation by acknowledging that in each of the last -- the prior three quarters that we believe that ordering patterns would oscillate. And that's pretty consistent when you're coming off of a period where there'd been an extra normal level of ordering that created a demand supply imbalance that afterwards, you're sort of draining your backlog as you are watching your customers try to align around what they're guessing is end customer demand. So, as a result of that, we have not had the same level of visibility out past 90 to 120 days that we would have during the more normal ordering pattern. And so, as a result of that, we don't have the same level of predictability. On the second half of your question, the one thing that remains consistent, whether it's under normal conditions or whether it's today, is we've always been in a very competitive marketplace. And, obviously, price downs are the norm and that we have competitors like ourselves that are trying to go after as much incremental business during this transitory period as is possible. Yeah. And one other thing to add, and this is specific to MPS, not necessarily a broader comment at the general market, but automotive came in a little bit lower than would have been expected. And as we look at the ramp in the second half, we're observing that at least for two of our customers, unit volumes appear to be lower, and we had two product launches which have been delayed into Q4 and to Q1. I think in most scenarios and this particular customer's representative is they want to take a leadership position through innovation, and they found us an equal partner for that. But it's in everybody's best interest that it'd be a competitive, not a single source. And so, yes, we'd always anticipated that there would be redesigns that allow competition into the market. Yeah. I think that normal seasonality for MPS would be somewhere between a sequential decline of between 4 percentage points and 5 percentage points. And I can point to the increase in the notebook sales during Q3, which precedes Christmas, so that's a normal seasonal factor that's expected to come down. And we're not seeing the uplift that had been anticipated from automotive. So, I would be more comfortable with a seasonal down in Q4. Sure. So, as far as what we observed in Q2 is that there was a meaningful decrease in channel inventories both in terms of dollars and days. And the sort of phenomena that we've seen has been a time delay between when the end customer places an order and when they want to do a pullback because of uncertainty with what end customer demand has been. So, I can point to a couple of our end markets where that was very clear. But we believe right now that we're in a position to continue to bring -- to normalize channel inventories over the next two quarters. Yeah. Again, going back to the comments about the visibility and predictability out past 90 or 120 days, that's not just the demand that -- the new net orders that we're receiving, but also the strength of the sell-through is also a little harder to predict. And I think if I could just add to that, it's also the breadth of the customer opportunities that we're engaged with. And over the course of the next four quarters, we're going to see multiple new customer applications launch initially with MPS. So, yes, we have a very powerful initial position with one customer, but we expect to branch that out very quickly. Multiple customers. Yeah. And I think that when you look at capacity today, it's really when this environment turns around and becomes more predictable, how are we positioned to service our customers a year and two years from now. And I think the investments that we're making, both in terms of expanding capacity and diversifying it geographically, both on the front-end and the back-end will pay very good dividends as far as customer satisfaction. Sure. I think that Michael responded to this pretty nicely in that we saw some improvement in Q2 from Q1 as far as our net bookings, but it's still not to the degree that we historically enjoyed in either 2018 or 2020, just to pick two more recent years. In the past, we would have up to 90%, 95% of our next quarter's revenue in hand at the end of the preceding quarter. And so, you're only relying on a fraction of a percent in order to -- of turns business in order to accomplish the numbers for that particular quarter. So, we're seeing steady improvement, but we're still not at the level yet where we have that predictability. Thanks again, Gen. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this webinar, and look forward to talking to you again during our third quarter webinar, which will likely be at the end of October. Thank you, and have a nice day."

            "content": "Let me add, too. We do see a slight improvement in first quarters, and essentially, it's similar. And we do see the consumer business improvement and -- from both -- from U.S. [side] (ph) to Asia side, and other ones, pretty much stay the same. Yes, you already answered your -- all your questions there. We don't see -- we are -- all the products relate to -- with the AI, like, we cannot ship enough now. And the other ones -- other part of enterprise data, it's like data centers, CPU powers, and these are still delayed. Okay. I think, so far, we're in the lead position. And I can't -- we are engaged deeply in the future design, and develop a new product for the second generations for the other -- next generations. And so, other than that, we can't speculate any things, okay? Either as a -- we had to provide the best solution, and at the same time, we understand that our customers require other solutions. This is a very large market. There's no means an MPS can supply everything. And, also, MPS is always -- we emphasize diversified growth. And if there's a performance need, I believe the MPS is the best solution now for the near future. Well, it's a -- you mentioned as a seasonality -- well, we're talking about seasonality, and I try to figure out what is seasonality now. And last year, we -- last couple of years, we have a very strong Q4, at least the year before that. And the customers see all those shortages, and now the demand is -- clearly is much less. And so, you have a -- we experienced, like, a year-over-year, so like a -- in the last couple years, like, over 40%. And this year, and it clearly is not as much, okay? I mean, much less. And I can't really call it seasonality anymore. So, just as I said, it's not very clear. But as Bernie said, usually in a seasonality, we're lowered. Yeah, that [we saw] (ph) delay a little bit, but we will reintroduce to resampling and announce, and it was a delay due to the technical issues. And so, as speaking right now, we have resampled it. And mostly, it's in automotive and also data centers. And same as we mentioned earlier, the silicon carbides and -- these are product that we'll start to sample. Yes. Okay. I believe that's our future. And when customers want to have a plug-in-play solutions and they want a less technically involved with power management, and that's -- module solution is the way to go. People doesn't want to buy ICs, design all of -- all these up -- the component. And, initially, that's where we're ramping a lot of them in the auto business, in the industrials, that can be an industrial site, and as well as a telecom, and -- or even semi equipment. And a lot of -- I can give -- go on and on, like, a lot of things to be mentioned. But most of all these products is not price sensitive, and they're not volume consumer-related product. And so, this is still at the very beginning. We have all these customer base, and we have all the new product coming out, and we'll see the similar growth rate in next few years. Yeah, as you see, we didn't participate at 4Gs. And 5Gs and other infrastructure business, all new to us. And so, you know that 5G hasn't really ramped up quickly yet. But our products in -- were designed in last few years, we're just waiting for our customers to give us orders. And so far, it's not clear. Okay. Next question? Yes. Yeah. So, that's a good question. So, now we see some improvement, but this is at the beginning. And, as we see our supply, the cost went down dramatically, and as Bernie said, our inventory values even -- I mean, it will reflect inventory value now. And so, in the past, MPS is named in the price killers. It's a very simple game. We don't mind, and we don't buy in that consumer segments and we have a fight. And all the high gross margins is on the other segments. And it's all because they share our technology strengths. We provide a much better, a much smaller size. And in a consumer segment, in the last couple of years, we neglected that, and -- because we don't have enough revenues -- or enough capacities. And so, it's not that difficult to go back to the same games that we played since IPOed. Our visibility is okay, probably is well documented. If you're listening to all these major AIs, [probably you will see] (ph) MPS. And you will see that MPS in the next few quarters of a potential. And -- but I can talk to you about technical issues. I think that the MPS is so far the solutions is far better than our competitor. So, we -- in a -- for the next generation of our AI processor, we're not working on now, we're working a year ago, even 18 months ago. And -- so the relationship is a strong and, also, for the technical reason, even more challenging. And the space is critical, and you had to radiate all the heat out. And for the next generation, power even higher. And so, we provide all these vertical solutions, and we pioneer with it. And all the other solution had to fit into the form in a form factors. And the integrated solution is the only way to go. It was multiple customers. Yeah. As we stated it earlier, many of our customers requested move out of China. And now we kind of achieved more than 50%. We can have more than 50% of our capability out of China. And so, the overall capacities, we don't have it. Problem now is, we have more inventories, and we want to sell more from our inventory. And -- does that answer your questions? Well, you're mentioning of pricing, of course, all these material costs is a much lower than -- or go back to normal, I should say, to -- as pre-pandemic. And so, in terms of a capacities, look, I didn't mention earlier, we want to expand out of China, that's from our customers' request. And the other one is we want to expand it because just for our next couple of years' growth. And mostly, we we're still in a -- follow our long-term plan, and we invest, of course, now which will slow down a little bit in the next few quarters, and -- but over the long term, so we should spin -- we should continue the course."

Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; and Bernie Blegen, VP and CFO. In the course of today's conference call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, which could cause results to differ materially from management's current views and expectations. Please refer to the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ are identified in the safe harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K filed on February 24, 2023, which is accessible through our website. MPS assumes no obligation to update the information provided on today's call. We will be discussing gross margin, operating expense, R&D and SG&A expense, operating income, other income, income before income taxes, net income and earnings on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A table that outlines the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in our Q1 2023 earnings release, which we have furnished to the SEC and is currently available on our website. I'd also like to remind you that today's conference call is being webcast live over the Internet and will be available for replay on our website for 1 year, along with the earnings release filed with the SEC earlier today. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.\nBernie Blegen: Thanks, Jen. MPS' first quarter revenue of $451.1 million came in about as expected, 19.4% higher than the first quarter of 2022 or 1.9% lower than revenue reported in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our results for the quarter were mixed with weaker quarter-to-quarter demand in our enterprise data and industrial markets, overshadowing improvements in consumer and automotive. Let's take a quick look at our first quarter 2023 revenue by market. First quarter 2023 consumer revenue of $63.4 million increased 19.5% from the fourth quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 revenue was down 20.8% year-over-year. Consumer revenue represented 14.8% of our first quarter 2023 revenue compared with 21.2 -- a 21.2% contribution in the first quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 automotive revenue of $105.3 million increased $8.0 million or 8.2% from the fourth quarter of 2022. This sequential revenue increase was primarily due to continued acceptance of our highly integrated solutions for advanced driver assistance systems, the digital cockpit and lighting applications. First quarter 2023 revenue was up 93.1% year-over-year. Automotive revenue represented 23.3% of MPS' first quarter 2023 revenue compared with 14.4% in the first quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 Communications revenue of $67.9 million rose $3.6 million or 5.6% from the fourth quarter of 2022. This quarter-over-quarter increase primarily reflected a modest revenue improvement in 5G infrastructure. First quarter 2023 revenue was up 22.2% year-over-year. Communications revenue represented 15.1% of MPS' first quarter 2023 revenue compared with 14.7% in the first quarter of 2022. In our storage and computing market, first quarter 2023 revenue of $119.8 million was essentially flat with revenue recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022, as declining storage revenue was offset by higher notebook sales. First quarter 2023 revenue was up 24.1% year-over-year. Storage and computing revenue represented 26.6% of MPS' first quarter 2023 revenue compared with 25.6% in the first quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 Industrial revenue of $47.5 million decreased $8.6 million or 15.3% from the fourth quarter of 2022. This quarter-over-quarter decrease was due to lower security and power source revenue. First quarter 2023 Industrial revenue was down 2.2% year-over-year. Industrial revenue represented 10.5% of our first quarter 2023 revenue compared with 12.9% in the first quarter of 2022. In Enterprise Data, first quarter 2023 revenue of $47.2 million decreased $21.3 million or 31.1% from the fourth quarter of 2022 due to broad-based weakness in data center spending. First quarter 2023 revenue was up 10.9% year-over-year. Enterprise data revenue represented 10.5% of MPS' first quarter 2023 revenue compared with 11.2% in the first quarter of 2022.  I'd like to share some general business observations. During our 2 most recent earnings calls, we highlighted that customers were becoming more concerned with near-term business conditions and that ordering patterns might oscillate. This behavior continued through the first quarter of 2023. However, we do see order acceleration for products related to artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, and power modules, and our customer engagement and design win momentum remains strong across all of our markets. Regarding operating expenses, we continue to invest in our operations to support long-term growth. In response to customer concerns, we are expanding and geographically diversifying both our global production, operations and our R&D activities.  In summary, we have strong customer engagement, design win momentum and are continuing to invest for the long term, even though timing of the revenue ramp from our customers remains uncertain. Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 57.4% and 80 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2022 and 60 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2022. Our GAAP operating income was $124.3 million compared with $136.9 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022.  For the first quarter of 2023, non-GAAP gross margin was 57.7%, 80 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2022 and 60 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2022. This downward pressure on gross margin is expected to continue near term as we work through higher value inventory built up during the supply-demand imbalance following the pandemic. Our non-GAAP operating income was $164.1 million compared to $174.1 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022.  Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $134.5 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared with $130.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2023 operating expenses were $96.0 million up from $94.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022.  The differences between GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan.  For the first quarter of 2023, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $1.1 million charge to cost of goods sold, was $37.0 million compared to $35.3 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022. Switching to the bottom line. First quarter 2023 GAAP net income was $109.8 million or $2.26 per fully diluted share compared with $119.1 million or $2.45 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 non-GAAP net income was $146 million or $3.00 per fully diluted share compared with $154 million or $3.17 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q1 2023 were $48.7 million. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $919.1 million at the end of the first quarter of 2023 compared to $739.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $218.8 million compared with operating cash flow of $52.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 capital spending totaled $8.9 million. Accounts receivable ended the first quarter of 2023 at $184.3 million or 37 days of sales outstanding, up 1 day from 36 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.  Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter of 2023 were $430.8 million, down from $447.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. Days of inventory decreased to 204 days at the end of Q1 2023 compared with 212 days at the end of fourth quarter of 2022.  Comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's projected revenue, you can see days of inventory decreased to 203 days at the end of the first quarter of 2023, from 212 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2023. We are forecasting Q2 revenue in the range of $430 million to $450 million. We also expect the following: GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.9% to 56.5%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 56.2% to 56.8%. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $132.5 million and $136.5 million. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $94.9 million to $96.9 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation expense, but includes litigation expense. Total stock-based compensation expense of $38.8 million to $40.8 million, including approximately $1.2 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold. Interest and other income is expected to range from $3.8 million to $4.2 million before foreign exchange gains or losses.  Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 48.6 million to 49.0 million shares. In conclusion, while we remain cautious about near-term business conditions, MPS will continue to focus on business development and investing in infrastructure as necessary to support our long-term growth. I'll now open the webinar up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel.\nTore Svanberg: I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more, Bernie, on your comment about the business conditions. Because it sounds like the design win momentum is still very strong. The activity is very strong, but you also sort of added there was uncertainty in certain ramps. So maybe you could elaborate a little bit on that, especially when thinking about the second half which seems to be a period where the industry could potentially recover.\nMichael Hsing: Let me answer my -- Tore, let me ask first, okay. And -- so you look at all these industries, okay, we -- it's about servers computing, including industrial servers and AI product, that's about 10% of the MPS revenue. And we had a hyper -- we experienced this area really the -- all the entire companies experienced hyper growth, okay, in the last 2 or 3 years. And now the automotive to, again, we're about 23% of our business. Total together and where it's about a 30-some percent. In AI other than, okay -- across the board, other than AI and automotive and so far, still we experienced still very heavy demand.  Other than that, again, all these design win activities that happened in the last 4, 5 years, and they started to ramp last couple of years. And a lot of -- because the reason we have all the inventory, we have expanded capacities and we grow much faster than the average. And now to answer your question directly, the -- our customers, all these products during a ramp, they have a pause. And they don't know what's coming and the new product and they push out. And so we just cutting in the period, which is not bad to me. Because in the last 2 or 3 years, we -- we have been in this unsustainable growth and hyper growth. It's like a 30%, 40% year-over-year, and that will break the company.  And I'm glad to announce we're, okay, coming to -- back to the normal I mean, and we will ride this the global market uncertainties and we just adapt as in the past. Okay, Bernie, maybe you can add some more detail, okay.\nBernie Blegen: And I think Michael has really laid out a very compelling case as far as the growth that we've experienced over the last 3 years, and also identifying that the automotive market remains solidly intact, but particularly in Enterprise Data with the exception of AI that we are seeing lag in ordering patterns there and general weakness in our other markets. So I think the thing to reinforce here is that the business model here remains intact. We've built MPS around sustainable growth over the long haul.  And right now, we're looking at a quarter where the end customer demand is not picking up as well as we might have anticipated a quarter or 2 quarters ago. But again, the business model is intact.\nTore Svanberg: That's great perspective. And as my follow-up, you talked about gross margin coming down very moderately because of higher value inventory. Could you talk about how long you expect that to play out and even some ranges? I mean I assume maybe you'll get to, I don't know, 55%, 56% gross margin. But yes, any color you can give on the -- how long that lower gross margin would last?\nBernie Blegen: Sure. And the good news here is that cycle times and pricing both in the fab, the assembly houses are coming down. And so we'll be able to participate in the lower cost after we burn down the inventory, which is currently at about 203, 204 days. So I would expect that we'll see a downward pressure on margins through Q2 and Q3, and then perhaps a moderation leveling in around Q4.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. Go ahead, Michael.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. I might as well add, clearly, we see -- we go into a downturn situation and gave me and -- we don't know, I guess, some segment will grow in MPS because of very diverse companies and some area would be still good. And in general, the consumers and they get products and even some notebook may come back in the second year. And the point is I'll try to make is regarding to gross margins, and as you know in the past, when the industry starts to slow down, and again, MPS will be more aggressive in price. And to gain more consumer segment of the market because it can do 6 months later, when you turn the knob, we actively pursue those products 6 months later, those are fast design cycles, and you will turn the knob in the revenues in about 6 months' time.  So we care less about the short-term gross margins, but the long-term gross margins is still the same. So we emphasize and as you know, in the last 10 years or so, and we'll still pursue those models. And in the consumer segment, we may -- we made just a short -- focus on in the short term to grow the -- to maintain the growth.\nOperator: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham.\nNathaniel Bolton: I guess I wanted to follow up on Tore's question. Really, Michael and Bernie, as you look into the second half of the year, that's normally a seasonally stronger period for the company. Obviously, it feels like there are lots of puts and takes, lots of uncertainty, customers delaying product ramps. But can you give us any sense how you're thinking about the second half of the year? Will you see sort of a normal seasonal uptick in September? Or are you thinking September could be flattish with kind of the 1Q, 2Q run rate? Any additional color would be helpful just to try to think about the second half.\nBernie Blegen: Sure. I think that right now, normal seasonality still applies, but in our case, it's a little more muted because so much of our growth in the business is attached to those new product introductions being made by our customers. So if we look in Enterprise Data in which our major customers or the products that we're supporting have had product delays. And when you look at other aspects of our business, for example, Communications, that's still what I'd refer to as lumpy. It's not necessarily trending in a seasonal pattern.  So I think that your comment is very balanced and all I'm tilting is to the new product introductions being delayed probably being a larger factor than just seasonality.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. I think we can't say really like a normal seasonality anymore. I mean we -- we experienced in the past. And you have some segments that grow really well. I mean some segments hit kind of a bottom that came last Q3, last year, Q4, especially like a notebook side. I mean now you see okay, it's a wakening up. I mean, MPS has won orders in design as those reference designs and we have the power -- the power solutions -- and we will see, second half, mostly all the other reservoir business, other than AI, automotive, we don't -- we have no clear views. And so that's the short term.\nNathaniel Bolton: Understood. I wanted to follow up on the Enterprise Data segment. Obviously, a weaker result and sounds like some of the product or customer delays are sort of focused in that segment. Do you still think as the new server cycle ramps that you can get your share of the Vcore power management market towards 20 percentage? Is that still the right opportunity to be thinking about longer term, even if some of those customer programs have pushed out by somewhat?\nMichael Hsing: Absolutely. I confidently say that. I mean, because we see all these projects has not really fully ramped yet. In all the data centers, clearly, you guys know better, I mean now slowed down dramatically. I don't know whether they overexpanded last couple of years and now slowed, take a pause, okay? We don't have clear views. And what we know from last quarter to Q1 -- or Q4, Q1 to now, and they kind of slowed down.\nBernie Blegen: And if I can add to that, again, using -- I know that you're focused right now on the short term as far as the second half of the year. But in the GPU space for artificial intelligence, we have a very senior market share position. And as we look ahead to even the next generation, we're in a very good position to take advantage of the next generation of GPUs. So we're really still in early stages as far as being able to leverage up our position and expand our share.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, yes. That's I didn't add that part. The GPU part came in the AI side, we have a current design win and as well as the next design, and the futures we will release end of the year or next year. And those were MPS product will ramp to this. Earlier, I referred to is that all these data centers, CPU powers or data center power overall, and we still have maybe just -- if it's not a single digit, just barely double-digit market shares. And a lot of -- and from a transition from a VR13 to 14, and it's not completed yet. We won a lot of design wins in VR14 and it will turn into revenues.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen.\nMatthew Ramsay: Guys, I wanted to ask, I guess, a two part question on gross margin, and this is sort of -- you guys have been in -- gone from sort of 54, 55, 56 on that steady cadence of 10 to 20 basis points a quarter, and that was amazingly steady. And then during the period of supply-demand imbalance, we jumped up to 58 or so, and now we've come back in and you guys discussed that in the short term. But as you look out over the next 2, 3 years and you think about the strategy to be aggressive and grow, and contrast that to some of the opportunities that you have for new design wins and higher content, maybe you could level set us on the long-term gross margin. Has anything changed there? And where is the new normal?  And I guess the second part of that thought, guys, is, have you seen any specific price pressure in any markets as some of your competitors maybe get more supply?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. Okay. Let me answer your last part first, okay. Any high volume, our customers have multiple suppliers, we -- they always have a price pressure, other than the last 2 or 3 years. Other than that, they couldn't ship, only the MPS came. Most of the companies have struggled in shipments and MPS, we have less. And so nowadays I mean all the higher volumes as we expected, and in the last couple of years, and I can also remember, we didn't talk that much. We introduced new technology, which is a much lower cost. And there will be a fight.  And so to answer that part of the question. But earlier, I said it, I care less about our gross margin lately, but we're still operating within the models. We're not dramatically go down. Clearly, it will go down. And but -- in a long-term model, to answer your question, 2 or 3 years out, the business -- MPS business is still pretty much intact. And we are focused on those high values. We transition from IC solutions to sell solutions. That still remains our focus. Our long-term business we will go that way and which generate and offers more values, and we have higher gross margins.\nBernie Blegen: And I think just to polish off the comment there is that as far as our model, we've been operating over the last several years between 55% and approaching 60% as far as a non-GAAP gross margin. And as we introduce these higher-value products, they tend to have higher margins. And what that allows us to do is then manage the mix of business such that we stay within our model. So while we sort of anticipated in the near term downward pressure with a flattening here in the next 3 to 4 quarters, we'll continue to look to be opportunistic and managing gross margin to accelerate revenue growth.\nMatthew Ramsay: Got it. As my follow-up, and I apologize for this being a near-term question, but with all the different end market volatility. Bernie, if you could help us on your guidance by segment, just the revenue trends that you guys see into the June quarter, that would be great.\nBernie Blegen: Sure. I think that we said earlier in the call...\nMichael Hsing: It's fair to ask a short-term question because this is a very uncertain period.\nBernie Blegen: So I think to sort of make a simple point on it is that automotive continues to be doing very well. And there, it's both the market itself as well as the share gains that we're enjoying. I said earlier that Communications is lumpy and the other areas, including Storage and Compute, Enterprise Data and Consumer and Industrial are sort of flattish for the near term.\nMichael Hsing: Well, also the storage -- in the AI segment in the -- in data center, if we -- the computing segment is maybe is flattish, okay? I mean I think the majority of our revenues has come from -- still come from servers. And you see it in the ramping in the last 18 months or so. In the AI and the total -- AI in the total revenues is still a smaller percentage. And the other thing I'm pointing out, there's a memory sections. I mean they're changing a new format, and they start to ramp now. This is the result that we're kind of flattish, okay? I mean it depends on how fast you ramp up to DDR5.  MPS has -- have engaged with all the major memory companies that we have a design. We have a -- we have design wins. And if they ramp up faster than we will -- we'll increase that portion of revenues. And it's depending on what the DDR5 will ramp up Matt.\nOperator: Our next question is going to be from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer.\nRichard Schafer: I appreciate all the color so far. Maybe if I could ask 1 on 48-volt before we go back on the AI for the question. I know you heard you say Michael or Bernie said it, I think you had said senior market share position there. I'm curious with your primary competitor in 48-volt apparently still struggling. I mean are we at a point now, if we look at 2023, where you guys think you'll likely stay sort of sole source sort of on H100 this year. And I'm just curious as part of that question. I heard you mention Content there. So is there any color you can give us around what Content does as we transition to sort of more powerful accelerators over time? I mean is it similar to what you guys have talked about with the move from VR13 to 14 on VCorPower, where you're talking about going from sort of $50 a or something like $70.  And then finally, Michael, for you, I'm just really curious, are you -- who else are you seeing out there working on 48-volt power? This seems to be a pretty solid and growing market.\nMichael Hsing: Okay. Let me answer my part first, and I'll get in...\nBernie Blegen: That's more fun part.\nMichael Hsing: On the landscape is okay, I truly okay, says we don't -- we see some competition in the game. I think our products remain the best so far. And so that's why we have -- and we do see some other competition, maybe as a generation of later that came in. As that market segment grows, and the competition will come. I mean the market is too big for MPS. And we welcome other people. And we welcome the cooperations. As a matter of fact, that's what we're doing and not, okay? And -- as MPS is not big enough for that market. And -- but we will be glad to be leaders.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. And again, reinforcing Michael's point there is that it actually when we enjoy a leadership position, and we expect to continue to, competition is very important as far as driving technology improvements. As far as your other question as far as dollar content, when we look at the CPU market, generally, we denominate it with a dual processor, -- and so based on that, we're able to offer an expectation of what the average selling price will be per server.  With the model is still sorting itself out where you can have any number of configurations up to and including 8 GPU boards. So it's very -- it's a little harder to denominate what our dollar content is. And again, we're still in the early stages of watching this model ramp. So I think that we'll have enough experience in about 2 to 3 quarters to have a more accurate read on the dollar content, but it is much higher than what we're experiencing with CPUs.\nRichard Schafer: And for my follow-up, I'd love to ask you about 5G band. I know you guys have said in the past you're selling to the big 3 RAN equipment OEMs. I'm just curious how you would describe the ramp there in terms of content, in terms of share? And what I am trying to do is get a sense of how big 5G is now versus how big it could be for you guys. And to something you mentioned earlier, Bernie, I'm just really curious here, could the ramp in 5G sort of smooth some of that lumpiness you described in your comm segment?\nBernie Blegen: Yes. If I was to draw a comparison of our experience with Enterprise Data where we started out with low dollar content and then graduated up the value chain including power management. We're probably about 3 to 4 years behind in the Communications market, where we're still focusing on low dollar content for like point of load knee fuse. Now where this is about to get very exciting is we are getting adoptions for later designs that include our power management for the processors.  So at this stage, we're sort of moving with the market. Again, as an early entrant. But yes, long term, I do think you're going to see a similar growth profile as what we expect to have with enterprise data.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, and immediately now, I keep saying MPS is a small company, but we're not nobody anymore. And we engage with all these customers -- these 5G makers and it's only a handful of a companies as speaking now. So we're in the process of signing on the contract now. And so all of these -- okay, and it's just a matter of time.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Seymore: Can you hear me?\nMichael Hsing: We have a high inventory, yes.\nRoss Seymore: How about the channel inventory. We've heard a bunch of companies talk about the channel coming down, and that's a headwind to revenue growth. I know you guys proactively manage that. So you put it on your own balance sheet, but what's the channel looking like?\nMichael Hsing: It's also on the high side.\nBernie Blegen: Yes. About 3 quarters ago, we saw an increase in channel inventories, and they've remained at about that same level. So there isn't any real new news as far as the sell-through characteristics.\nRoss Seymore: Is that something that's weighing against your revenue right now? Or are you comfortable running at that relatively higher level?\nMichael Hsing: No, we want to go lower and we want to lower and particularly in the first quarters and a lot of customer threatens and get much higher volumes, okay? That's why we shipped and now they have a break. And so as a result, inventory didn't decrease that much in the channel.\nRoss Seymore: So it went down on your books more so than in the channel?\nBernie Blegen: Yes. The way to look at another aspect to this is that the inventory in the channel, it depends on what our end customers' lead times are. And as we even commented on in the prepared comments, we're seeing a very unusual demand pattern in that we have 3 areas where we're seeing an acceleration as far as the ordering pattern. But they're doing it with a very -- an expectation of having a very short lead time.  So as Michael said earlier, that the channel is built up in the anticipation that the customers were going to realize the sales gains with the new products, but as those have been pushed out, that's left us in this position. So we're going to continue to manage the channel as we always have. But right now, as I said, it's at an elevated level.\nRoss Seymore: Got it. And then 1 on the gross margin for you, Bernie. When you talked about the headwinds for it, we see this across the board. So I don't think it's anything particularly different for Monolithic. But the 1 thing you didn't mention was mix. I get that you're carrying higher cost inventory, and it takes a while to flush through. But as you go opportunistically, into the consumer market, is that rising as a percentage of sales, something that is also weighing against gross margins? And if so, when do you think that will kind of normalize as a percentage of sales, if not decrease?\nMichael Hsing: Yes, you can see as a normal because the consumer market hasn't happened yet. We reduced -- we downed to the big percentage now, okay? And mostly it's a high-value inventory.\nOperator: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist.\nWilliam Stein: Regarding something you just spoke about a moment ago, you spoke about elevated inventory and push outs of projects. I think obsolescence risk is relatively small for Monolithic, but maybe you can reassure us on that matter.\nBernie Blegen: Absolutely. Actually, a very helpful question. If you look at our history, we've never had a significant inventory write-off. And a lot of the reasons around that is that our products have long life in the market and long shelf life. So we're actually -- if you look back at 2019, we built up inventories, and we're able to capitalize when the market bounced back in '20 and particularly when the pandemic, infusion of capital occurred.  So we don't see inventory on our balance sheet as a negative. And in fact, when the markets do get more stabilized, particularly in Enterprise Data and in Storage and Computing, I think we're well positioned to take advantage of that uplift.\nWilliam Stein: Great. And then like to sort of ask a double question about supply and your supply base. Other analog companies have talked about how their foundries are absolutely not cutting cost and they never see it happening, but you've highlighted this trend in your business. Is it because you're on more advanced nodes and so that's just how sort of pricing in that market works? And then maybe you could also comment on the manufacturing plan, both in terms of long-term capacity and geographic diversity.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. We -- you know that, okay, we advance our technology every 2 or 3 years. And we're relentlessly cutting the cost and utilize the better technologies, get better geometries. The fab now in the last 3 years, the fab costs is not lower, higher, as a matter of fact. But we utilized the geometries and also the new technology that we implement, we will be able to lower the cost.  And so the other -- the other question that you're making is a diversified manufacturing. So, we in -- we anticipated that, again, we announced that we have a new partnership outside of China. That's in Singapore. And we will continue to do so. But really outside, there's no U.S. manufacturing for our application, for our product. I mean, it's all resides in Asia, Korea, like Taiwan and Southeast Asia. And in all our module business, we can do it from our side outside of China.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.\nBernie Blegen: I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this Q1 2023 earnings webinar. I look forward to talking to you again during our second quarter conference call, which would likely be in July. Thank you. Have a nice day.",

            "name": "Bernie Blegen",
            "content": "Thanks, Jen. MPS' first quarter revenue of $451.1 million came in about as expected, 19.4% higher than the first quarter of 2022 or 1.9% lower than revenue reported in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our results for the quarter were mixed with weaker quarter-to-quarter demand in our enterprise data and industrial markets, overshadowing improvements in consumer and automotive. Let's take a quick look at our first quarter 2023 revenue by market. First quarter 2023 consumer revenue of $63.4 million increased 19.5% from the fourth quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 revenue was down 20.8% year-over-year. Consumer revenue represented 14.8% of our first quarter 2023 revenue compared with 21.2 -- a 21.2% contribution in the first quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 automotive revenue of $105.3 million increased $8.0 million or 8.2% from the fourth quarter of 2022. This sequential revenue increase was primarily due to continued acceptance of our highly integrated solutions for advanced driver assistance systems, the digital cockpit and lighting applications. First quarter 2023 revenue was up 93.1% year-over-year. Automotive revenue represented 23.3% of MPS' first quarter 2023 revenue compared with 14.4% in the first quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 Communications revenue of $67.9 million rose $3.6 million or 5.6% from the fourth quarter of 2022. This quarter-over-quarter increase primarily reflected a modest revenue improvement in 5G infrastructure. First quarter 2023 revenue was up 22.2% year-over-year. Communications revenue represented 15.1% of MPS' first quarter 2023 revenue compared with 14.7% in the first quarter of 2022. In our storage and computing market, first quarter 2023 revenue of $119.8 million was essentially flat with revenue recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022, as declining storage revenue was offset by higher notebook sales. First quarter 2023 revenue was up 24.1% year-over-year. Storage and computing revenue represented 26.6% of MPS' first quarter 2023 revenue compared with 25.6% in the first quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 Industrial revenue of $47.5 million decreased $8.6 million or 15.3% from the fourth quarter of 2022. This quarter-over-quarter decrease was due to lower security and power source revenue. First quarter 2023 Industrial revenue was down 2.2% year-over-year. Industrial revenue represented 10.5% of our first quarter 2023 revenue compared with 12.9% in the first quarter of 2022. In Enterprise Data, first quarter 2023 revenue of $47.2 million decreased $21.3 million or 31.1% from the fourth quarter of 2022 due to broad-based weakness in data center spending. First quarter 2023 revenue was up 10.9% year-over-year. Enterprise data revenue represented 10.5% of MPS' first quarter 2023 revenue compared with 11.2% in the first quarter of 2022.  I'd like to share some general business observations. During our 2 most recent earnings calls, we highlighted that customers were becoming more concerned with near-term business conditions and that ordering patterns might oscillate. This behavior continued through the first quarter of 2023. However, we do see order acceleration for products related to artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, and power modules, and our customer engagement and design win momentum remains strong across all of our markets. Regarding operating expenses, we continue to invest in our operations to support long-term growth. In response to customer concerns, we are expanding and geographically diversifying both our global production, operations and our R&D activities.  In summary, we have strong customer engagement, design win momentum and are continuing to invest for the long term, even though timing of the revenue ramp from our customers remains uncertain. Moving now to a few comments on gross margin. GAAP gross margin was 57.4% and 80 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2022 and 60 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2022. Our GAAP operating income was $124.3 million compared with $136.9 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022.  For the first quarter of 2023, non-GAAP gross margin was 57.7%, 80 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2022 and 60 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2022. This downward pressure on gross margin is expected to continue near term as we work through higher value inventory built up during the supply-demand imbalance following the pandemic. Our non-GAAP operating income was $164.1 million compared to $174.1 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022.  Let's review our operating expenses. Our GAAP operating expenses were $134.5 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared with $130.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our non-GAAP first quarter 2023 operating expenses were $96.0 million up from $94.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022.  The differences between GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarters discussed here are primarily stock compensation expense and income or loss from an unfunded deferred compensation plan.  For the first quarter of 2023, total stock compensation expense, including approximately $1.1 million charge to cost of goods sold, was $37.0 million compared to $35.3 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022. Switching to the bottom line. First quarter 2023 GAAP net income was $109.8 million or $2.26 per fully diluted share compared with $119.1 million or $2.45 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 non-GAAP net income was $146 million or $3.00 per fully diluted share compared with $154 million or $3.17 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of Q1 2023 were $48.7 million. Now let's look at the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $919.1 million at the end of the first quarter of 2023 compared to $739.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. For the quarter, MPS generated operating cash flow of about $218.8 million compared with operating cash flow of $52.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 capital spending totaled $8.9 million. Accounts receivable ended the first quarter of 2023 at $184.3 million or 37 days of sales outstanding, up 1 day from 36 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.  Our internal inventories at the end of the first quarter of 2023 were $430.8 million, down from $447.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. Days of inventory decreased to 204 days at the end of Q1 2023 compared with 212 days at the end of fourth quarter of 2022.  Comparing current inventory levels with the following quarter's projected revenue, you can see days of inventory decreased to 203 days at the end of the first quarter of 2023, from 212 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. I would now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter of 2023. We are forecasting Q2 revenue in the range of $430 million to $450 million. We also expect the following: GAAP gross margin in the range of 55.9% to 56.5%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 56.2% to 56.8%. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses between $132.5 million and $136.5 million. GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to be in the range of $94.9 million to $96.9 million. This estimate excludes stock compensation expense, but includes litigation expense. Total stock-based compensation expense of $38.8 million to $40.8 million, including approximately $1.2 million that would be charged to cost of goods sold. Interest and other income is expected to range from $3.8 million to $4.2 million before foreign exchange gains or losses.  Fully diluted shares to be in the range of 48.6 million to 49.0 million shares. In conclusion, while we remain cautious about near-term business conditions, MPS will continue to focus on business development and investing in infrastructure as necessary to support our long-term growth. I'll now open the webinar up for questions. And I think Michael has really laid out a very compelling case as far as the growth that we've experienced over the last 3 years, and also identifying that the automotive market remains solidly intact, but particularly in Enterprise Data with the exception of AI that we are seeing lag in ordering patterns there and general weakness in our other markets. So I think the thing to reinforce here is that the business model here remains intact. We've built MPS around sustainable growth over the long haul.  And right now, we're looking at a quarter where the end customer demand is not picking up as well as we might have anticipated a quarter or 2 quarters ago. But again, the business model is intact. Sure. And the good news here is that cycle times and pricing both in the fab, the assembly houses are coming down. And so we'll be able to participate in the lower cost after we burn down the inventory, which is currently at about 203, 204 days. So I would expect that we'll see a downward pressure on margins through Q2 and Q3, and then perhaps a moderation leveling in around Q4. Sure. I think that right now, normal seasonality still applies, but in our case, it's a little more muted because so much of our growth in the business is attached to those new product introductions being made by our customers. So if we look in Enterprise Data in which our major customers or the products that we're supporting have had product delays. And when you look at other aspects of our business, for example, Communications, that's still what I'd refer to as lumpy. It's not necessarily trending in a seasonal pattern.  So I think that your comment is very balanced and all I'm tilting is to the new product introductions being delayed probably being a larger factor than just seasonality. And if I can add to that, again, using -- I know that you're focused right now on the short term as far as the second half of the year. But in the GPU space for artificial intelligence, we have a very senior market share position. And as we look ahead to even the next generation, we're in a very good position to take advantage of the next generation of GPUs. So we're really still in early stages as far as being able to leverage up our position and expand our share. And I think just to polish off the comment there is that as far as our model, we've been operating over the last several years between 55% and approaching 60% as far as a non-GAAP gross margin. And as we introduce these higher-value products, they tend to have higher margins. And what that allows us to do is then manage the mix of business such that we stay within our model. So while we sort of anticipated in the near term downward pressure with a flattening here in the next 3 to 4 quarters, we'll continue to look to be opportunistic and managing gross margin to accelerate revenue growth. Sure. I think that we said earlier in the call... So I think to sort of make a simple point on it is that automotive continues to be doing very well. And there, it's both the market itself as well as the share gains that we're enjoying. I said earlier that Communications is lumpy and the other areas, including Storage and Compute, Enterprise Data and Consumer and Industrial are sort of flattish for the near term. That's more fun part. Yes. And again, reinforcing Michael's point there is that it actually when we enjoy a leadership position, and we expect to continue to, competition is very important as far as driving technology improvements. As far as your other question as far as dollar content, when we look at the CPU market, generally, we denominate it with a dual processor, -- and so based on that, we're able to offer an expectation of what the average selling price will be per server.  With the model is still sorting itself out where you can have any number of configurations up to and including 8 GPU boards. So it's very -- it's a little harder to denominate what our dollar content is. And again, we're still in the early stages of watching this model ramp. So I think that we'll have enough experience in about 2 to 3 quarters to have a more accurate read on the dollar content, but it is much higher than what we're experiencing with CPUs. Yes. If I was to draw a comparison of our experience with Enterprise Data where we started out with low dollar content and then graduated up the value chain including power management. We're probably about 3 to 4 years behind in the Communications market, where we're still focusing on low dollar content for like point of load knee fuse. Now where this is about to get very exciting is we are getting adoptions for later designs that include our power management for the processors.  So at this stage, we're sort of moving with the market. Again, as an early entrant. But yes, long term, I do think you're going to see a similar growth profile as what we expect to have with enterprise data. Yes. About 3 quarters ago, we saw an increase in channel inventories, and they've remained at about that same level. So there isn't any real new news as far as the sell-through characteristics. Yes. The way to look at another aspect to this is that the inventory in the channel, it depends on what our end customers' lead times are. And as we even commented on in the prepared comments, we're seeing a very unusual demand pattern in that we have 3 areas where we're seeing an acceleration as far as the ordering pattern. But they're doing it with a very -- an expectation of having a very short lead time.  So as Michael said earlier, that the channel is built up in the anticipation that the customers were going to realize the sales gains with the new products, but as those have been pushed out, that's left us in this position. So we're going to continue to manage the channel as we always have. But right now, as I said, it's at an elevated level. Absolutely. Actually, a very helpful question. If you look at our history, we've never had a significant inventory write-off. And a lot of the reasons around that is that our products have long life in the market and long shelf life.

            "content": "Let me answer my -- Tore, let me ask first, okay. And -- so you look at all these industries, okay, we -- it's about servers computing, including industrial servers and AI product, that's about 10% of the MPS revenue. And we had a hyper -- we experienced this area really the -- all the entire companies experienced hyper growth, okay, in the last 2 or 3 years. And now the automotive to, again, we're about 23% of our business. Total together and where it's about a 30-some percent. In AI other than, okay -- across the board, other than AI and automotive and so far, still we experienced still very heavy demand.  Other than that, again, all these design win activities that happened in the last 4, 5 years, and they started to ramp last couple of years. And a lot of -- because the reason we have all the inventory, we have expanded capacities and we grow much faster than the average. And now to answer your question directly, the -- our customers, all these products during a ramp, they have a pause. And they don't know what's coming and the new product and they push out. And so we just cutting in the period, which is not bad to me. Because in the last 2 or 3 years, we -- we have been in this unsustainable growth and hyper growth. It's like a 30%, 40% year-over-year, and that will break the company.  And I'm glad to announce we're, okay, coming to -- back to the normal I mean, and we will ride this the global market uncertainties and we just adapt as in the past. Okay, Bernie, maybe you can add some more detail, okay. Yes. I might as well add, clearly, we see -- we go into a downturn situation and gave me and -- we don't know, I guess, some segment will grow in MPS because of very diverse companies and some area would be still good. And in general, the consumers and they get products and even some notebook may come back in the second year. And the point is I'll try to make is regarding to gross margins, and as you know in the past, when the industry starts to slow down, and again, MPS will be more aggressive in price. And to gain more consumer segment of the market because it can do 6 months later, when you turn the knob, we actively pursue those products 6 months later, those are fast design cycles, and you will turn the knob in the revenues in about 6 months' time.  So we care less about the short-term gross margins, but the long-term gross margins is still the same. So we emphasize and as you know, in the last 10 years or so, and we'll still pursue those models. And in the consumer segment, we may -- we made just a short -- focus on in the short term to grow the -- to maintain the growth. Yes. I think we can't say really like a normal seasonality anymore. I mean we -- we experienced in the past. And you have some segments that grow really well. I mean some segments hit kind of a bottom that came last Q3, last year, Q4, especially like a notebook side. I mean now you see okay, it's a wakening up. I mean, MPS has won orders in design as those reference designs and we have the power -- the power solutions -- and we will see, second half, mostly all the other reservoir business, other than AI, automotive, we don't -- we have no clear views. And so that's the short term. Absolutely. I confidently say that. I mean, because we see all these projects has not really fully ramped yet. In all the data centers, clearly, you guys know better, I mean now slowed down dramatically. I don't know whether they overexpanded last couple of years and now slowed, take a pause, okay? We don't have clear views. And what we know from last quarter to Q1 -- or Q4, Q1 to now, and they kind of slowed down. Yes, yes. That's I didn't add that part. The GPU part came in the AI side, we have a current design win and as well as the next design, and the futures we will release end of the year or next year. And those were MPS product will ramp to this. Earlier, I referred to is that all these data centers, CPU powers or data center power overall, and we still have maybe just -- if it's not a single digit, just barely double-digit market shares. And a lot of -- and from a transition from a VR13 to 14, and it's not completed yet. We won a lot of design wins in VR14 and it will turn into revenues. Yes. Okay. Let me answer your last part first, okay. Any high volume, our customers have multiple suppliers, we -- they always have a price pressure, other than the last 2 or 3 years. Other than that, they couldn't ship, only the MPS came. Most of the companies have struggled in shipments and MPS, we have less. And so nowadays I mean all the higher volumes as we expected, and in the last couple of years, and I can also remember, we didn't talk that much. We introduced new technology, which is a much lower cost. And there will be a fight.  And so to answer that part of the question. But earlier, I said it, I care less about our gross margin lately, but we're still operating within the models. We're not dramatically go down. Clearly, it will go down. And but -- in a long-term model, to answer your question, 2 or 3 years out, the business -- MPS business is still pretty much intact. And we are focused on those high values. We transition from IC solutions to sell solutions. That still remains our focus. Our long-term business we will go that way and which generate and offers more values, and we have higher gross margins. It's fair to ask a short-term question because this is a very uncertain period. Well, also the storage -- in the AI segment in the -- in data center, if we -- the computing segment is maybe is flattish, okay? I mean I think the majority of our revenues has come from -- still come from servers. And you see it in the ramping in the last 18 months or so. In the AI and the total -- AI in the total revenues is still a smaller percentage. And the other thing I'm pointing out, there's a memory sections. I mean they're changing a new format, and they start to ramp now. This is the result that we're kind of flattish, okay? I mean it depends on how fast you ramp up to DDR5.  MPS has -- have engaged with all the major memory companies that we have a design. We have a -- we have design wins. And if they ramp up faster than we will -- we'll increase that portion of revenues. And it's depending on what the DDR5 will ramp up Matt. Okay. Let me answer my part first, and I'll get in... On the landscape is okay, I truly okay, says we don't -- we see some competition in the game. I think our products remain the best so far. And so that's why we have -- and we do see some other competition, maybe as a generation of later that came in. As that market segment grows, and the competition will come. I mean the market is too big for MPS. And we welcome other people. And we welcome the cooperations. As a matter of fact, that's what we're doing and not, okay? And -- as MPS is not big enough for that market. And -- but we will be glad to be leaders. Yes, and immediately now, I keep saying MPS is a small company, but we're not nobody anymore. And we engage with all these customers -- these 5G makers and it's only a handful of a companies as speaking now. So we're in the process of signing on the contract now. And so all of these -- okay, and it's just a matter of time. We have a high inventory, yes. It's also on the high side. No, we want to go lower and we want to lower and particularly in the first quarters and a lot of customer threatens and get much higher volumes, okay? That's why we shipped and now they have a break. And so as a result, inventory didn't decrease that much in the channel. Yes, you can see as a normal because the consumer market hasn't happened yet. We reduced -- we downed to the big percentage now, okay? And mostly it's a high-value inventory. Yes. We -- you know that, okay, we advance our technology every 2 or 3 years. And we're relentlessly cutting the cost and utilize the better technologies, get better geometries. The fab now in the last 3 years, the fab costs is not lower, higher, as a matter of fact. But we utilized the geometries and also the new technology that we implement, we will be able to lower the cost.  And so the other -- the other question that you're making is a diversified manufacturing. So, we in -- we anticipated that, again, we announced that we have a new partnership outside of China. That's in Singapore. And we will continue to do so. But really outside, there's no U.S. manufacturing for our application, for our product. I mean, it's all resides in Asia, Korea, like Taiwan and Southeast Asia. And in all our module business, we can do it from our side outside of China."

Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; Bernie Blegen, EVP and CFO; and Tony Balow, Vice President of Finance. Earlier today, along with our earnings announcement, MPS released a written commentary on the results of our operations. Both of these documents can be found on our website. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone, that in the course of today's presentation, we may make forward-looking statements and projections within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainty. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q3 earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K, which can be found on our website. Our statements are made as of today and we assume no obligation to update this information. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.\nBernie Blegen: Thanks, Gen. Good afternoon, and welcome to our Q3 '24 earnings call. MPS achieved record quarterly revenue of $620.1 million, 22% higher than revenue in the second quarter of 2024 and 30% higher than revenue in the third quarter of 2023. Our performance during the quarter reflected the strength of our diversified market strategy as we experienced improved ordering trends across most end markets and additionally benefited from initial revenue ramps associated with design wins secured in prior years. Let me call out a few highlights. Q3 2024 automotive revenue was up 28% sequentially with improvements in infotainment, lighting, ADAS, and body controls. Communication revenue was up 65% from the prior quarter, reflecting new product ramps for Wi-Fi, optical, networking, and router solutions. Storage and Compute revenue was up 25% sequentially on the strength of demand for DDR5 and SSD memory and notebooks. MPS continues to focus on innovation, solving our customers' most challenging problems, and maintaining the highest level of quality. In addition, we continue to expand and diversify our global supply chain, which will allow us to capture future growth, maintain supply chain stability, and swiftly adapt to market changes as they occur. Our proven long-term growth strategy remains intact as we continue our transformation from being a chip-only semiconductor supplier to a full-service silicon-based solutions provider. I'll now open the webinar up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.\nRick Schafer: Thanks and congrats to you guys. I guess I've got a two-part question if I could. The first is on enterprise data. It looked like it was down about 15% sequentially. I don't know if you could give some color on that. Is that one-time in nature? Or does that reflect a more sustained shift in that segment as we look into 4Q and then into '25? And then my second part of my question, I mean, it looked like auto, I knew you listed a few of them Bernie, automotive, industrial comps, consumer all look like they were up pretty materially sequentially. So is that -- how would you characterize those segments, which have sort of been lagging the last few quarters? Do you feel like those have made the turn?\nBernie Blegen: Sure, Rick. This is Bernie. Let me start with the enterprise data. Sequentially, we were down about 1.5% from Q2. And that a couple of things that we've talked about. One is that, we don't control our customers' ordering patterns. So as it relates to the current quarter, we did see a different ordering trend than we'd observed in each of the past six quarters. And then as far as looking ahead, we've been very open about the fact that as far as supply chain security for our customers, that's going to require a second or third competitor to introduce -- be introduced on the share. And so there's a lot of issues here that we've been talking about and that we're managing. But one very important point is that MPS's strength is in the diversity and we don't try to call out a particular end market's results. We try to deliver the company in total. And that's sort of a short-term view, but Michael may have a couple of comments on longer-term view.\nMichael Hsing: Yeah. You probably everybody knows that if you look at the transcript from the last year, we talk about it. The market is big and the market is growing. Well the AI requirements is growing. And so the customers initially will take the -- always take the best solutions and to fulfill their needs. And the best solutions and also the speed of the development service, as you, as Bernie said earlier. And that's why we occupied as a pretty large shares, okay? And I mean, last year, we said that, okay, this market is too big and MPS will be always have a best solutions in these applications. And we will talk -- we also talk about in a -- the market is bigger, there will be a second or third and fourth supply to join this segment. And okay and this is the -- and when would have happen? And we don't know, okay. It happened in the last couple of quarters and they gave me in the next years. What we see that, again, the market is growing very fast. We have other ones like SOC side of market segment and like it hasn't really ramped up yet or started ramping. And the other ones like -- other hyperscale like company -- cloud computing companies and their own SOCs and their own TPUs, they call it the tensor processes system. And that those one is our -- still small. We're ramping in the next few quarters, okay? And as Bernie said that, MPS in the past, we always emphasized diversity and we will not be known to be a AI power supply company.\nBernie Blegen: And then, Rick, I think you had a question as far as automotive and whether or not the step up that we observed from Q2 to Q3 was more of a broader trend line or if it was a one-time event. And this we believe is a step up where a lot of design wins have been waiting in the pipeline for the right opportunity. And so we do believe that specific to us, not a discussion about the broader market, but specific to us that the number of product ramps are expected to come into the next -- come into the stream in the next two or three quarters.\nMichael Hsing: Well, again, okay, as we -- as we said many, many years ago, there's a lot of new design wins. And when the ramp will take off, we don't know. It will be plus minus a year or so. Do we care? We don't, okay? And then now all these greenfield products start to rejuvenate and that's what you see in the revenue to date.\nTony Balow: And maybe one more comment just for Rick is that, traditionally, we've been talking about strength in ADAS, but what you heard Bernie talk about was, we saw that strength in automotive across kind of all the segments, including infotainment, body controls, really a sign of those sockets that we had won previously now start generating revenue. So it's more broad-based within automotive than maybe we talked about previously.\nRick Schafer: Thanks for all that color, you guys. And maybe, right on that point on auto specifically. I realize that this is a broad-based pickup and it's some place basically design win driven as all things are with you guys. But I'm curious, specific, I mean, NVIDIA did believe it did really well the last year or two with drive, Warren, and I know you guys do power there. So I didn't know if you could talk specifically about China auto and what content trends look like for you guys there and maybe give a sense of how big China auto is now as sort of a portion of your overall auto segment. Thanks a lot.\nMichael Hsing: Well, China is again, EV business is booming. And now the tapered off a little bit and looks like it will -- booming again. And we're going in the right direction again, okay. And there's a lot of requirements. And the infotainment and the new type of infotainment and also the ADAS, okay. It's widely adopted in China. And so that's what we see a bigger portion of it is ramping from China. And also we see it in the -- and other than ADAS, okay, we see a lot of other products and grow -- will grow in -- from Germany -- in Germany and in the US.\nRick Schafer: Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.\nTore Svanberg: Yes, thank you, and congratulations on the record revenue. I wanted to follow up on enterprise data. Obviously, you had two very strong quarters, first half of the year, it took a breather this quarter. But how should we think about that business into the December quarter? And Michael, I know you talked about many new product ramps in 2025, but just sort of specifically for Q4, how should we expect that business to perform?\nMichael Hsing: As far as I know, Q4, we don't lose any shares and probably it's going in the -- it was the same as the forecast. Okay, we don't, okay, we don't -- we can't really tell. And this forecast was given us to us in a few quarters ago. And we just fulfill that, fulfill the demand. So we'll have a -- that's what we built for me -- in the last couple of quarters.\nBernie Blegen: Yeah. And I think as we look to the outlook and the guidance that we provided, really enterprise data was somewhere in the plus low-single-digits. So again, our customers ordering patterns are really what drives the performance there.\nTore Svanberg: No, that's very fair. And the one big surprise to me this quarter was communications. I think it was your strongest growth segment this quarter. You highlighted Wi-Fi optical networking. Could you maybe just give us a little bit more color what's going on there? I mean, it does sound like you have some new segments there that you are penetrating, especially on the optical side.\nMichael Hsing: Well, the opticals, okay, is a data converter, data communications, within the data centers, okay, within the reps, okay. And that's a portion of it. But that's not all of them, okay. Other one is the new Wi-Fi format and okay start to ramping up. That's the MPS will have a lot of reference designs and that's what we see. It's across the continent. All these projects turning to a revenue now.\nTony Balow: So I think the outlook for, again MPS specifically remains very solid. Generally, after you have a big initial stocking in the quarter with a new revenue ramp, it tends to tail off for a quarter, but we see sustainable growth in communications through the first half of '25.\nTore Svanberg: Great. Thank you for the color. I'll go back in line.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joshua Buchalter of Cowen. Joshua, your line is now open.\nJoshua Buchalter: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I think in response to Rick's question, you mentioned two factors that sort of drove the flattening out of enterprise data being order patterns and second sourcing. I guess could you -- or could you maybe rank order which one of those had the bigger impact near-term? And in particular, as we think about your customers diversifying their suppliers, are you seeing this more on AI accelerator platforms that are already in the market or is this tied to the newer platforms that are currently ramping? Thank you.\nBernie Blegen: So I think Michael offered that in Q4, we're not expecting Q3 and Q4 to see share position change. So that was really just trying to acknowledge that is a function of being the market leader in the AI. And then over time, as we see a layering of all these new AI opportunities, Michael referred to the TPUs, which will probably begin to ship late.\nMichael Hsing: I don't know if the TPU is what I remember is the TPU maybe is -- maybe Google's name, a trademark name. To me it's a tensor processor.\nTony Balow: Tensor processor.\nMichael Hsing: Yeah it's all -- that's what we mean. And it's all really -- some of you in the call referred this as SOCs. And we have many design, we engage with many of our customers in many years ago. And those products is actually we see start to ramp in the last quarter.\nBernie Blegen: Yeah. Okay.\nJoshua Buchalter: Thank you for the color. And I realize you've got content in multiple different sockets on many of these accelerator cards. And so my question is going to try to oversimplify it. But how should we think about, as we think about some of these new AI accelerator platforms, your content opportunity may be in relationship to power draw of the actual processors or any other helpful Rules of Thumbs you can give us as we try to fine-tune our models in the next year. Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: Well, you said, if you believe so like I hope and -- if you believe as we believe, our products, our solution is the best and the most power efficient and the market is bigger. And that portion of our revenue will grow. The rest of the stuff, I don't get -- I don't -- we don't care. Just let it happen. Let the numbers speaks up.\nJoshua Buchalter: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Caso of Wolfe. Chris, your line is now open.\nChris Caso: Yes. Thank you. Good evening. I guess, the first question, as we look at your guidance for the December quarter, not a lot changing on a sequential basis. I think you mentioned that the enterprise data will be up low-single-digits sequentially in December. Anything else that you would call out as kind of growing or shrinking different from the average in December? And then following that, given that enterprise data has grown as a percentage of revenue, does that affect seasonality as you look into the March quarter? Is there anything we should be thinking about with respect to the different customer mix as we go into March?\nBernie Blegen: Sure. If you're looking at Q4 by end market, it's interesting you have some seasonality, but currently, we don't believe that any of the end markets are going to change by more than plus or minus mid-single-digits. So it's a very, very narrow range that we're talking about there. And when we look out into the momentum carried into '25, obviously, we don't guide beyond Q4, but it has been seasonally down quarter for a lot of companies, but I don't have a view on what that's going to look like currently.\nChris Caso: Okay. Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: We don't, especially, we don't really care. So as long as we have a design, we design and we are in the project with our customers. And when those ramps start to happen, our customer -- they don't have a clear view. And let those products -- let take its own calls, let the numbers speak itself.\nChris Caso: Okay. As a follow-up, as you look into next year, the other part of your enterprise data business on traditional server, that's an area that you guys have been favorable on for a while, but I guess, you've been waiting for the market to improve. We heard some a little better news from at least one of the CPU vendors this week. Can you give some view of kind of the share content, what you're seeing in that part of the enterprise data business as you go into 2025?\nMichael Hsing: Yes. It's a good question. Yes, we do see it, and the volumes started picking up. And as we said many quarters -- many years ago and this was -- this rapid sapphire of something. And the VR 14, we will pick up the shares in the 13.5, by serendipity of a shortage and we prove with significant suppliers in that. And VR 14 and what will be a significant, well, one of the big supply in -- in this rapid sapphire growth.\nTony Balow: And maybe just beyond just the enterprise data segment itself, as you see those ramp, right, they'll pull through other solutions like DDR5 memory and continue to be a tailwind in some of the other segments as well.\nChris Caso: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open.\nWilliam Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Michael, I know you often are involved in some interesting sort of sometimes idiosyncratic growth drivers for the company. I know for some time, you were famously tinkering in the automotive end market and sort of searching for more effective solutions than what was available in the market. And I understand your focus has been perhaps more in the home automation market more recently. And I wonder if you can talk to us about, some things that might be on the come in the next couple of years from the company in that end market.\nMichael Hsing: Yes. As you know, it's an MPS have a few thousands of our products. So we're in lighting, we're in -- we are in a thermostat and we are in shades controls and we're in all these fan models and security, the window actuators, and the window and door opening actuators. And we're also making MCU now. And those MCU can be a brain of everything while we're just putting the one box and we're putting one box with the software. So and we sell as a kit. Everything is -- everything including it. It's the key is the ease of use. I think this will change the market segment for building automations.\nWilliam Stein: That's helpful. Maybe as a follow-up, you mentioned, your MCUs now. There's another category that you entered relatively recently. You're not really known for it as much, but data converters. I know I think you hired a team in that area and you had some very good results for initial product, maybe in the medical end market. Can you talk about traction in that category, please?\nMichael Hsing: We are growing in that segment. The revenue is still small. As you know, these are -- these are design cycles is very long. And also the product life cycles 10, 20 years. I mean they will last forever. And those segments win-win some in some industrial side as well as the medical side. And we have -- as we have more product rolling out as a matter of fact in the next couple of quarters some family of standard product. We will gain more market shares in this segment.\nWilliam Stein: Great. Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.\nRoss Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a questions. I want to go back to the non-enterprise data side, I think by my math, it was up about 35%, 36% sequentially. I know, you guys have a ton of design wins and you're kind of just waiting for them to ramp, but the magnitude of that ramp, the diversity of it, and just the commentary that bookings are improving seems to be at odds with the very muted recovery that so many of the peers are seeing. So could you just explain, do you think cyclical conditions are getting better or is this a very Monolithic power-specific dynamic? Any sort of color on that.\nBernie Blegen: I think, Ross, we're experiencing a little bit of both. Is somebody?\nMichael Hsing: House, can you mute it? Yeah. Okay. You can mute it. Yeah. Okay.\nBernie Blegen: So, Ross, you're asking the difference between growth specific to us and what we're seeing in the market. And in the current quarter or let me go back, the previous quarter, we actually saw improvements in our ordering patterns. But they're not a consistent trend. But what we saw in the current quarter was a lot of new revenue opportunities that we received from design wins secured in previous years that were coming to market now, particularly in the communications, particularly in automotive. And then also we saw an improvement in the overall profile of the memory market.\nMichael Hsing: Well, as a matter of fact, we see all across the board.\nBernie Blegen: Yeah.\nMichael Hsing: Other than AI. Other than AI power and all across the board.\nRoss Seymore: And how are you -- I guess as my follow-up, whether it's in the AI side or otherwise, a lot of supply has been added to the market over the last couple of years to address shortages, et cetera. And so a fear people have is that pricing pressure is going to ensue, whether it's more competition in AI power that you mentioned earlier or just a more aggregate holistic increase in pricing pressure. Are you guys seeing any evidence of that?\nMichael Hsing: Well, our competitors also some of the Chinese suppliers and they always want to lower the price to get in the market to get in the socket. That's not the game what we played. And so a lot of the -- our customers they don't change those socket. They don't change the -- our products can swap in -- and quickly. And those kind of things is in a -- and also to the way we emphasize diversity. So not in one segment. It has a lot of shipments and a lot of volumes going into the one particular applications. And for example like AI and we will provide the value. Our value is the highest performance. And all the other products let our customers choose and so the history is telling us, our history short, and as we -- as long as we operate in the same principles and the revenue will keep growing and growing the same way. And we see the next couple of years, especially next year, we see -- all these products will grow. And now this is -- which is to see the first sign of it, and all these design win turning into the revenue now.\nRoss Seymore: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.\nQuinn Bolton: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, first to start off, I think it was for the first time ever in your June 10-Q, you guys disclosed a 10% plus customer. And I'm wondering, I know you haven't filed the Q yet, but if that's going to be an ongoing disclosure, would you be able to provide us if you had any 10% customers in the June, sorry, September quarter? And if so, what percent of revenue was that customer?\nBernie Blegen: So, Quinn, what you're referencing is basically revenue exposure by direct customer and indirect. And when the customer hits a certain threshold according to the SEC guidelines, we need to put a reference to that.\nMichael Hsing: But we're never putting a name out there.\nBernie Blegen: No, no. We do not.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, this time, we have -- still have a one customer is bigger than 10%.\nBernie Blegen: Yeah.\nMichael Hsing: Bernie, you can check that numbers. Is that right? Only two customers and above 10%.\nQuinn Bolton: Okay. And we'll get percentages in the Q.\nBernie Blegen: It's one or two.\nMichael Hsing: Yeah, I think, it's one or two. You can check that. I believe it's one. Bernie you can check that. No, it's only one. Two will be very big. I don't -- I don't believe the numbers.\nBernie Blegen: We don't. We don't.\nMichael Hsing: Yeah.\nQuinn Bolton: Okay. The second question is, I know, you don't want to guide to 2025 yet.\nMichael Hsing: Hold on a second. Tony, could you --\nBernie Blegen: Check that?\nMichael Hsing: Yeah, could you check that, is that one or two? I think the second one is less than 4%.\nTony Balow: Yes, I'll check it. Give me 10 seconds, so I'll get back to you.\nMichael Hsing: Yeah. Yeah. So we are, okay, this had to be on our record. And then let's make it clear. Go ahead.\nQuinn Bolton: Yes. Maybe while we're waiting for Tony, my second question was, I know you're not going to sort of give a specific guidance out to 2025, but The Street is looking for continued pretty strong growth in the enterprise data segment. I know you've talked about lots of crosscurrents in terms of expecting some additional competition to enter that market, some pricing pressure at existing customers, but you also have the ASIC designs that start to ramp next year. The Street is kind of looking for that business to hit almost $1.1 billion in revenue. And just wondering is that given your crystal ball, is that sort of a reasonable expectation? Do you think that we should be tempering expectations for that segment, given some of the cross-currents you've mentioned or do you want to just kind of keep it one quarter at a time?\nMichael Hsing: Yes, I can tell very confident, confidently we will be, okay, let's say that. And when this market -- when this AI market turn into like a regular server market, MPS will be a significant player in that. And now this is not -- became a, what do you call it, reach to an equilibrium yet.\nBernie Blegen: Not a run rate.\nMichael Hsing: No, yeah, this is still ramping up. And when this segment is ramping -- when you start to ramping, it's kind of lumpy. You don't see this thing, okay, you don't see -- you can't keep going forever like the first two -- since last year and the first -- in the first couple of this quarters like our first couple of quarter in this year. And next -- and so to answer your question for next year, clearly, so we have a lot more customers as I said earlier, that will start to ramping those designs will turn into -- those design will turn into revenues.\nTony Balow: Michael, just to circle back relative to distie, we'll call out two, for direct, we'll call out one.\nBernie Blegen: Okay. That's a direct customer, not a distie.\nTony Balow: So we'll call one direct. We'll call out multiple distie is higher than 10%.\nMichael Hsing: Yeah, well, distie will never come, and because all the reporting we -- that's in the reporting, all the design creation, all the exposures for the end customer is only one. The next one is, I believe, is a less than -- is about definitely is below 5%.\nBernie Blegen: Yeah.\nQuinn Bolton: Got it. Thank you, Michael. Thank you, Bernie.\nMichael Hsing: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you. I had a similar question to Quinn, but thinking more about vertical power. So enterprise data this year more than $700 million. I assume the contribution from vertical power is still quite low. And if that's the case, as the market does transition to vertical power, could we see this market base basically even accelerate over the next few years?\nMichael Hsing: Absolutely. Not in next few years, next few quarters. Yes. We -- as we said, look, we are playing the power module market segments in -- since 2017. And all these technology, all these manufacturing capabilities and that will really benefit for these vertical power. And as speaking, now we are shipping those products in good volumes.\nTore Svanberg: Sounds good. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.\nRoss Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me get a little follow-up snuck in here. Inventory, I know Michael, you and I have laughed about that in many times like this in the past.\nMichael Hsing: That's my favorite topic.\nRoss Seymore: There you go.\nMichael Hsing: Yeah.\nRoss Seymore: In this instance, internal inventory came down by a lot days-wise. What did external channel do? How are you looking at that? Was some of that 35% sequential growth that I referred to in my initial question a little bit ago, inventory fill, or has the channel stayed lean?\nBernie Blegen: No, the channel stayed lean. In fact, our total days went down in the quarter.\nMichael Hsing: Well, we want to -- this is not good. We want to build up. And as always, we build the inventory in the -- it's not synced with the market demand. And you see our -- Ross, okay, you're the expert of MPS inventory. If you checked like our inventory levels, it's the opposite of the market demand. And now the market demand for MPS now is very high. So the inventory is low and we don't think that we're going to reign to a shortage issue, but it's at the inventory level is at the uncomfortable level.\nRoss Seymore: Got you. And I guess just to clarify, Bernie, when you said total inventory actually went down, you mean just total channel inventory days fell.\nBernie Blegen: Total channel inventory, yes.\nMichael Hsing: Channel inventory is also low. yeah.\nRoss Seymore: Got it. Okay. That's it. Thanks guys.\nOperator: This now concludes our Q&A session. I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.\nBernie Blegen: Thank you. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call and look forward to talking to you again in our fourth quarter conference call, which is likely to be in early February. Thank you. Have a nice day.",

            "name": "Bernie Blegen",
            "content": "Thanks, Gen. Good afternoon, and welcome to our Q3 '24 earnings call. MPS achieved record quarterly revenue of $620.1 million, 22% higher than revenue in the second quarter of 2024 and 30% higher than revenue in the third quarter of 2023. Our performance during the quarter reflected the strength of our diversified market strategy as we experienced improved ordering trends across most end markets and additionally benefited from initial revenue ramps associated with design wins secured in prior years. Let me call out a few highlights. Q3 2024 automotive revenue was up 28% sequentially with improvements in infotainment, lighting, ADAS, and body controls. Communication revenue was up 65% from the prior quarter, reflecting new product ramps for Wi-Fi, optical, networking, and router solutions. Storage and Compute revenue was up 25% sequentially on the strength of demand for DDR5 and SSD memory and notebooks. MPS continues to focus on innovation, solving our customers' most challenging problems, and maintaining the highest level of quality. In addition, we continue to expand and diversify our global supply chain, which will allow us to capture future growth, maintain supply chain stability, and swiftly adapt to market changes as they occur. Our proven long-term growth strategy remains intact as we continue our transformation from being a chip-only semiconductor supplier to a full-service silicon-based solutions provider. I'll now open the webinar up for questions. Sure, Rick. This is Bernie. Let me start with the enterprise data. Sequentially, we were down about 1.5% from Q2. And that a couple of things that we've talked about. One is that, we don't control our customers' ordering patterns. So as it relates to the current quarter, we did see a different ordering trend than we'd observed in each of the past six quarters. And then as far as looking ahead, we've been very open about the fact that as far as supply chain security for our customers, that's going to require a second or third competitor to introduce -- be introduced on the share. And so there's a lot of issues here that we've been talking about and that we're managing. But one very important point is that MPS's strength is in the diversity and we don't try to call out a particular end market's results. We try to deliver the company in total. And that's sort of a short-term view, but Michael may have a couple of comments on longer-term view. And then, Rick, I think you had a question as far as automotive and whether or not the step up that we observed from Q2 to Q3 was more of a broader trend line or if it was a one-time event. And this we believe is a step up where a lot of design wins have been waiting in the pipeline for the right opportunity. And so we do believe that specific to us, not a discussion about the broader market, but specific to us that the number of product ramps are expected to come into the next -- come into the stream in the next two or three quarters. Yeah. And I think as we look to the outlook and the guidance that we provided, really enterprise data was somewhere in the plus low-single-digits. So again, our customers ordering patterns are really what drives the performance there. So I think Michael offered that in Q4, we're not expecting Q3 and Q4 to see share position change. So that was really just trying to acknowledge that is a function of being the market leader in the AI. And then over time, as we see a layering of all these new AI opportunities, Michael referred to the TPUs, which will probably begin to ship late. Yeah. Okay. Sure. If you're looking at Q4 by end market, it's interesting you have some seasonality, but currently, we don't believe that any of the end markets are going to change by more than plus or minus mid-single-digits. So it's a very, very narrow range that we're talking about there. And when we look out into the momentum carried into '25, obviously, we don't guide beyond Q4, but it has been seasonally down quarter for a lot of companies, but I don't have a view on what that's going to look like currently. I think, Ross, we're experiencing a little bit of both. Is somebody? So, Ross, you're asking the difference between growth specific to us and what we're seeing in the market. And in the current quarter or let me go back, the previous quarter, we actually saw improvements in our ordering patterns. But they're not a consistent trend. But what we saw in the current quarter was a lot of new revenue opportunities that we received from design wins secured in previous years that were coming to market now, particularly in the communications, particularly in automotive. And then also we saw an improvement in the overall profile of the memory market. Yeah. So, Quinn, what you're referencing is basically revenue exposure by direct customer and indirect. And when the customer hits a certain threshold according to the SEC guidelines, we need to put a reference to that. No, no. We do not. Yeah. It's one or two. We don't. We don't. Check that? Not a run rate. Okay. That's a direct customer, not a distie. Yeah. No, the channel stayed lean. In fact, our total days went down in the quarter. Total channel inventory, yes. Thank you. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call and look forward to talking to you again in our fourth quarter conference call, which is likely to be in early February. Thank you. Have a nice day."

            "name": "Tony Balow",
            "content": "And maybe one more comment just for Rick is that, traditionally, we've been talking about strength in ADAS, but what you heard Bernie talk about was, we saw that strength in automotive across kind of all the segments, including infotainment, body controls, really a sign of those sockets that we had won previously now start generating revenue. So it's more broad-based within automotive than maybe we talked about previously. So I think the outlook for, again MPS specifically remains very solid. Generally, after you have a big initial stocking in the quarter with a new revenue ramp, it tends to tail off for a quarter, but we see sustainable growth in communications through the first half of '25. Tensor processor. And maybe just beyond just the enterprise data segment itself, as you see those ramp, right, they'll pull through other solutions like DDR5 memory and continue to be a tailwind in some of the other segments as well. Yes, I'll check it. Give me 10 seconds, so I'll get back to you. Michael, just to circle back relative to distie, we'll call out two, for direct, we'll call out one. So we'll call one direct. We'll call out multiple distie is higher than 10%."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Michael Hsing",
            "content": "Yeah. You probably everybody knows that if you look at the transcript from the last year, we talk about it. The market is big and the market is growing. Well the AI requirements is growing. And so the customers initially will take the -- always take the best solutions and to fulfill their needs. And the best solutions and also the speed of the development service, as you, as Bernie said earlier. And that's why we occupied as a pretty large shares, okay? And I mean, last year, we said that, okay, this market is too big and MPS will be always have a best solutions in these applications. And we will talk -- we also talk about in a -- the market is bigger, there will be a second or third and fourth supply to join this segment. And okay and this is the -- and when would have happen? And we don't know, okay. It happened in the last couple of quarters and they gave me in the next years. What we see that, again, the market is growing very fast. We have other ones like SOC side of market segment and like it hasn't really ramped up yet or started ramping. And the other ones like -- other hyperscale like company -- cloud computing companies and their own SOCs and their own TPUs, they call it the tensor processes system. And that those one is our -- still small. We're ramping in the next few quarters, okay? And as Bernie said that, MPS in the past, we always emphasized diversity and we will not be known to be a AI power supply company. Well, again, okay, as we -- as we said many, many years ago, there's a lot of new design wins. And when the ramp will take off, we don't know. It will be plus minus a year or so. Do we care? We don't, okay? And then now all these greenfield products start to rejuvenate and that's what you see in the revenue to date. Well, China is again, EV business is booming. And now the tapered off a little bit and looks like it will -- booming again. And we're going in the right direction again, okay. And there's a lot of requirements. And the infotainment and the new type of infotainment and also the ADAS, okay. It's widely adopted in China. And so that's what we see a bigger portion of it is ramping from China. And also we see it in the -- and other than ADAS, okay, we see a lot of other products and grow -- will grow in -- from Germany -- in Germany and in the US. As far as I know, Q4, we don't lose any shares and probably it's going in the -- it was the same as the forecast. Okay, we don't, okay, we don't -- we can't really tell. And this forecast was given us to us in a few quarters ago. And we just fulfill that, fulfill the demand. So we'll have a -- that's what we built for me -- in the last couple of quarters. Well, the opticals, okay, is a data converter, data communications, within the data centers, okay, within the reps, okay. And that's a portion of it. But that's not all of them, okay. Other one is the new Wi-Fi format and okay start to ramping up. That's the MPS will have a lot of reference designs and that's what we see. It's across the continent. All these projects turning to a revenue now. I don't know if the TPU is what I remember is the TPU maybe is -- maybe Google's name, a trademark name. To me it's a tensor processor. Yeah it's all -- that's what we mean. And it's all really -- some of you in the call referred this as SOCs. And we have many design, we engage with many of our customers in many years ago. And those products is actually we see start to ramp in the last quarter. Well, you said, if you believe so like I hope and -- if you believe as we believe, our products, our solution is the best and the most power efficient and the market is bigger. And that portion of our revenue will grow. The rest of the stuff, I don't get -- I don't -- we don't care. Just let it happen. Let the numbers speaks up. We don't, especially, we don't really care. So as long as we have a design, we design and we are in the project with our customers. And when those ramps start to happen, our customer -- they don't have a clear view. And let those products -- let take its own calls, let the numbers speak itself. Yes. It's a good question. Yes, we do see it, and the volumes started picking up. And as we said many quarters -- many years ago and this was -- this rapid sapphire of something. And the VR 14, we will pick up the shares in the 13.5, by serendipity of a shortage and we prove with significant suppliers in that. And VR 14 and what will be a significant, well, one of the big supply in -- in this rapid sapphire growth. Yes. As you know, it's an MPS have a few thousands of our products. So we're in lighting, we're in -- we are in a thermostat and we are in shades controls and we're in all these fan models and security, the window actuators, and the window and door opening actuators. And we're also making MCU now. And those MCU can be a brain of everything while we're just putting the one box and we're putting one box with the software. So and we sell as a kit. Everything is -- everything including it. It's the key is the ease of use. I think this will change the market segment for building automations. We are growing in that segment. The revenue is still small. As you know, these are -- these are design cycles is very long. And also the product life cycles 10, 20 years. I mean they will last forever. And those segments win-win some in some industrial side as well as the medical side. And we have -- as we have more product rolling out as a matter of fact in the next couple of quarters some family of standard product. We will gain more market shares in this segment. Okay. House, can you mute it? Yeah. Okay. You can mute it. Yeah. Okay. Well, as a matter of fact, we see all across the board. Other than AI. Other than AI power and all across the board. Well, our competitors also some of the Chinese suppliers and they always want to lower the price to get in the market to get in the socket. That's not the game what we played. And so a lot of the -- our customers they don't change those socket. They don't change the -- our products can swap in -- and quickly. And those kind of things is in a -- and also to the way we emphasize diversity. So not in one segment. It has a lot of shipments and a lot of volumes going into the one particular applications. And for example like AI and we will provide the value. Our value is the highest performance. And all the other products let our customers choose and so the history is telling us, our history short, and as we -- as long as we operate in the same principles and the revenue will keep growing and growing the same way. And we see the next couple of years, especially next year, we see -- all these products will grow. And now this is -- which is to see the first sign of it, and all these design win turning into the revenue now. But we're never putting a name out there. Yes, this time, we have -- still have a one customer is bigger than 10%. Bernie, you can check that numbers. Is that right? Only two customers and above 10%. Yeah, I think, it's one or two. You can check that. I believe it's one. Bernie you can check that. No, it's only one. Two will be very big. I don't -- I don't believe the numbers. Yeah. Hold on a second. Tony, could you -- Yeah, could you check that, is that one or two? I think the second one is less than 4%. Yeah. Yeah. So we are, okay, this had to be on our record. And then let's make it clear. Go ahead. Yes, I can tell very confident, confidently we will be, okay, let's say that. And when this market -- when this AI market turn into like a regular server market, MPS will be a significant player in that. And now this is not -- became a, what do you call it, reach to an equilibrium yet. No, yeah, this is still ramping up. And when this segment is ramping -- when you start to ramping, it's kind of lumpy. You don't see this thing, okay, you don't see -- you can't keep going forever like the first two -- since last year and the first -- in the first couple of this quarters like our first couple of quarter in this year. And next -- and so to answer your question for next year, clearly, so we have a lot more customers as I said earlier, that will start to ramping those designs will turn into -- those design will turn into revenues. Yeah, well, distie will never come, and because all the reporting we -- that's in the reporting, all the design creation, all the exposures for the end customer is only one. The next one is, I believe, is a less than -- is about definitely is below 5%. Okay. Absolutely. Not in next few years, next few quarters. Yes. We -- as we said, look, we are playing the power module market segments in -- since 2017. And all these technology, all these manufacturing capabilities and that will really benefit for these vertical power. And as speaking, now we are shipping those products in good volumes. That's my favorite topic. Yeah. Well, we want to -- this is not good. We want to build up. And as always, we build the inventory in the -- it's not synced with the market demand. And you see our -- Ross, okay, you're the expert of MPS inventory. If you checked like our inventory levels, it's the opposite of the market demand. And now the market demand for MPS now is very high. So the inventory is low and we don't think that we're going to reign to a shortage issue, but it's at the inventory level is at the uncomfortable level. Channel inventory is also low. yeah."

Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; Bernie Blegen, EVP and CFO; and Tony Balow, VP of Finance. Earlier today, along with our earnings announcement, MPS released a written commentary on the results of our operations. Both of these documents can be found on our website. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that in the course of today's presentation, we may make forward-looking statements and projections within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risk and uncertainty. Risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements are identified in the Safe Harbor statements contained in the Q2 earnings release, and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K, which can be found on our website. Our statements are made as of today, and we assume no obligation to update this information. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie Blegen.\nBernie Blegen: Thanks, Gen. Good afternoon, and a big welcome to all of you. Let me open by saying MPS reported yet another record quarter with Q2, 2024 revenue of $507.4 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance. Our strong revenue growth was attributed to three factors, increased demand for AI power solutions, improving order trends in several of our end markets. And lastly, initial revenue ramps associated with design wins secured in past years. Separately, we continue to expand and diversify our global supply chain, to ensure supply stability and capture future growth. As we have emphasized for many years, our results reflect continued success of our proven long-term growth strategy, and our transformation from being only a chip supplier, to a full solutions provider. I will now open the webinar up for questions. Gen, could you please ask the first caller?\nA - Genevieve Cunningham: Our first question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Matt, your line is now open.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much, everybody. Good afternoon. Michael, Bernie, congratulations on, I'll just say, it's nice to have a calm part in the storm relative to what's been - all of us have been dealing with over the last two weeks, so congrats. I wanted to ask a couple of questions that I imagine the enterprise data segment is going to be a huge focus on this call. So maybe I'll just start with the first question. Bernie, if you could maybe give us some directional color by end market in your guidance for September, I'd appreciate it. And secondly, Michael, if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in some of the non-enterprise data segments, like things like consumer, comms, auto. The model's been driven by this big growth in enterprise data, but from what I can tell, your company's had a lot of design win success in some of these other areas where the macro has really been challenging. And I'm wondering if you're starting to see any green shoots there yet, for recovery in some of those other segments? Thanks, guys.\nBernie Blegen: Sure, I'll keep my comments fairly short as far as the Q3 outlook by end market. Essentially, the bookings trend that we carried into Q3 has improved quite a bit over the last few quarters, and has been fairly broad as far as the end market participation. If you look specifically at enterprise data, you'll see that we took a fairly large step up in each of the last two quarters. And then in the third quarter outlook, we see continued growth in communications, storage and computing with incremental improvements and also in our other groups.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, your second question, as Bernie said it, we do see some of our - other business would not relate to AI. And now it is difficult to separate AI, non-AI. Other business we designed in which we - let's say that, okay we ship these products to the half a year ago. A year before we see the market start to wakening up. But that's whatever it is, whatever it is, okay. And we do see a lot of new design, new requirement, which is much higher power, for especially for communications. And well, as a matter of fact, as across the board. And these designs are much higher power than the previous versions. And these are all relate to the new design, relate to AI - and AI requirements. And these design wings, we'll probably triggered downs in a game of two [ph] or three years, and change of revenues.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much, guys. I appreciate it. I asked two questions. So I'll get back in the queue. Thanks.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Dustin Fowler of Oppenheimer. Dustin, your line is now open.\nDustin Fowler: Hi guys, I just have couple of quick questions. So for power isolation, I believe you ramp later this year in auto followed by data center next year. I think both markets could be Greenfield opportunities in the hundreds of millions each. Could you just give us a sense of the ramp in both markets, the competitive landscape and maybe any market sizing if you can?\nBernie Blegen: Dustin, I apologize. This is Bernie. I didn't hear which two markets.\nDustin Fowler: Oh, sorry. That was auto and data center for power isolation?\nMichael Hsing: Okay. Yes. We do start to ship in the gate [ph] and the product for the higher powers and for data centers. And this is only the beginning. And would you say that that's very true? Auto is being known and we, when ADAS and became more, more and more the cars converged into the ADAS, okay. And which we believe in being a two or three years, all the cars will have that features. And we, so far we provide all the, we have design wing in all these car makers, especially in the EVs.\nDustin Fowler: Okay. And I guess as we think about kind of auto this year, I think street has auto model flat. I guess how realistic is that given 70% content gains you have with your largest auto customer before power isolation plus the wins with Chinese OEMs? I guess maybe for Bernie, are you modeling auto flat this year? And how should we kind of think about share gains?\nMichael Hsing: Well, we cannot pick the, you want to pick the models and gave me, and you want to pick them, I can't give you a model. My accuracy is a plus minus 12 months. And going forward, we are very confident.\nBernie Blegen: Yes, I think the near term outlook for automotive remains a little bit fuzzy. And for example, in Q2, we were expecting a nice uplift, which did not occur. And so Michael's correct is that positioning within the next two, three quarters, is hard to predict for auto more broadly and EV specifically, but our long-term positioning is only getting better with additional design wins.\nDustin Fowler: All right, thanks guys.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. William, your line is now open.\nWilliam Stein: Great, thanks for taking my question. Michael, I'm hoping you can linger on that comment you made about solution selling. I think might've been the term used. I think in the past, we've been conditioned to hear about modules versus semis. Can you linger as to what your, maybe spend a minute explaining what sorts of products and what end markets, and what growth you see coming from that activity?\nMichael Hsing: I like that question. Yes, okay. As we said, we started that journey long time ago, okay. And at the beginning, maybe I didn't know, we didn't know what the hell we were talking about. And okay, but that's the directions. And that's including a part of e-commerce. And we sell plug and play solutions. So the effort is that the journey will be, we are, we known to be a semiconductor company. And yes, we do. We do all that we provide. And when we sell a silicon, we're selling, actually we're selling a solutions. We know all the technical details in terms of how we implement the solutions. So my effort is we want to monetize all our knowledges. MPS in the end, doesn't make any things. And we all making the money from our knowledge. While we capitalize all the entire our capabilities. And so the journey we started, now we're selling the solutions. It's probably 20%, 25% of a total MPS total revenue. Every piece of a silicon used to be selling somewhere between $1 and $0.50 to $1. Some of them are a lot of them even lower for the mass market. And which we kind of vary little now, especially in consumer business. And now, we're turning to a solution company is still a semiconductor based solutions. We sell those solutions. Now particularly as you call it, as a modules. And like I don't know what the appropriate word for that. And so today is 25%, 20% to 25% of a total revenues. MPS module business excluding AI. We're running a couple hundred, close to $200 million. And we're growing every year by more than company's percentage growth. And if you look at this, this way, every chip we sell, all the solution is more than a chip price. And you generally $4, $5, $6, $10 of a content that we can sell. So that's the result of today. And we will commit on the journeys. And again, we're transforming a company to a silicon only, to silicon based solution providers.\nBernie Blegen: And Will, if I could just add two comments quickly. The first is, and this is specific to your question, that it's across all of our markets. It primarily focuses on those that have longer design cycles, where we can add expertise in design solution. And the second point is again, while we are driving a lot, a higher percentage of our business to the modules, or to the more complete solutions. We have the ability, like no other company to be able to deliver the type of solution our customer wants, whether it's a die, a chip or some package in between.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, and many -- maybe traditional semiconductor companies and they are hard to distinguish, whether they're solution providers or selling modules, selling solutions or selling semiconductor only. And that's especially the case and apply for AI powers. And there's a very few company using a silicon based, the module solution to power up this AI solution or data centers.\nWilliam Stein: If I can add a follow-up please. Can you talk about what you're doing in vertical power delivery? I know there's a lot of companies that are claiming to have it, or be ramping it. And I know you guys are one of those companies that are I think more clearly delivering, but maybe you can talk about what your efforts are yielding in that area? Thank you.\nMichael Hsing: We are - in the leading positions. Okay, I said it - and there's maybe one, I will say the one or two company. Maybe one company have the capability have - and similar to MPS, the market is huge and it's growing. And MPS is, what the leading position, is because not by one day, like one-or-one an AI happened, we developed that years ago for that. And there's not many semiconductor companies that are based at the semiconductor company have that kind of a capability.\nWilliam Stein: Thanks guys, good job on the quarter.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.\nQuinn Bolton: Hi guys, let me offer my congratulations. Maybe just first Bernie, a quick follow-up on Matt Ramsay's question on the drivers of sequential growth in the third quarter. I think you mentioned comms and storage and computing, but I didn't hear you specifically say enterprise data. I just wanted to confirm enterprise data is still one of the big growth drivers in the third quarter. And then I'll get to the two questions?\nBernie Blegen: On the enterprise data, the way I tried to tee that up, first off, yes, it is expected to grow, but we have grown significantly each of the four prior quarters to this. So the rate of growth is slowing down. And the biggest for this quarter only. And I offer that because there's a lot of opportunities that have yet to begin to ramp with a number of the different companies that we're currently working on designs with. But I was calling out in particular that both storage and computing and communications will be good drivers in Q3.\nMichael Hsing: Quinn, you know VR 13.5 and we start to have a significant revenues. And that was the beginning, you know that. And VR 14, which hasn't really ramped up yet. And we have a lot of design, we increase it. VR 13.5 is like a MPS -- MPS is a test case. And so when during the shortage, okay, a lot of revenues, a lot of volumes shifted to MPS. And our competitors couldn't deliver, we delivered and we delivered. And now the benefit it is - for VR 14, where will be a significant players in the market segment?\nBernie Blegen: And particularly in the second half of this year, it looks like that segment is starting to take off.\nQuinn Bolton: Great, that was going to be served. I guess my first question was just, could you talk within the enterprise data about some of the opportunities, whether it's on the CPU power side or just broadening out of your AI portfolio? And then I'll have another question on vertical power if I could squeeze in that second question?\nMichael Hsing: Go ahead.\nQuinn Bolton: So the question on vertical power, I mean, just some different competitors, may mean different things when they're talking about vertical power. And I just wanted to kind of get your guys' view on the market. When you guys talk about vertical power, is that true vertical power where the voltage regulator is sitting underneath the processor substrate and supplying current vertically into the processor? Or do you guys consider sort of stacked packages, where you've got one or more voltage regulators, or phases in a module with the power inductors and capacitors, and other things that might be stacked vertically, but still delivering current laterally into the processor? What's your definition of vertical? Because I think there's some confusion in the market of what may be vertical and what might look vertical, but actually still supply current laterally?\nMichael Hsing: Yes, you're right. There's one is some customers so Quinn and using the top surface lateral power supply, which is like a very similar to server, the server CPU power supply. And other ones turning into the backside, still lateral powers. And more advanced one is directly under the CPU. And so to answer the question, is MPS supply currently we're running all three solutions? Chip, all modules, we have everything there.\nBernie Blegen: And Quinn, if I could also add to this that, the necessity for the different deliveries of power, is as you get into increasingly higher current and in addition to either lateral or vertical power, we also have liquid cooled that, we believe that we have a position on.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, to Quinn, to answer your question is that the most efficient and difficult to do, is you're making a module directly under the CPU. And that's the highest efficiency power delivery. There's a lot of a problem, and a lot of technical issues associated with that type of approach. So many companies take a conservative approach, okay? And some companies just do only like servers and top surface lateral power delivery. And for those very high powers, well over 1000 watt, all these powers, the power modules directly under the CPUs. And these are the highest efficiency.\nQuinn Bolton: Got it. Thank you, Michael. Thank you, Bernie.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Chris Caso of Wolfe. Chris, your line is now open.\nBernie Blegen: Chris, can you hear us?\nChris Caso: Sorry, I was on mute. You can hear me now?\nMichael Hsing: Yes.\nChris Caso: All right, sorry, thank you. The first question is on seasonality, and how that may be changing for you. In the past, the December quarter typically was a seasonally down quarter, but your business mix has changed quite a bit, since those days and the revenue is now coming from segments that are not as seasonally, not a seasonal December quarter. With that, how should we look at December seasonality going forward, or is the old model no longer appropriate, as we look forward? And if there's anything you want to comment on with respect to December?\nMichael Hsing: Yes, we're seeking advice from you. What's our seasonality? With a new business, with all these inventory oscillation from our customers, and we don't know so came in - you have a huge shortage, then it comes up the huge over supplies, and okay now, the main, I assume, and our customers consumes all these excessive inventory. Now the market is waking up. And is there another shortage? I don't know. And it's difficult to forecast. And - the lead time is still very short.\nChris Caso: Okay. So we'll do our best for everything good thing?\nMichael Hsing: Yes, yes. You can tell us.\nChris Caso: All right. That's fair enough. As my follow-up question, I wanted to follow-up with vertical power as well. And what we know, particularly within the enterprise segment AI, we've got some higher wattage processors coming. Can you talk about what you expect for content on that, and what in particular you expect for vertical power next year? Because I know there's some debate, certainly doesn't seem to be debate over whether you're ready for vertical power, whether the ecosystem is ready for vertical power. And does that make a difference with regard to your content, as you go into the next generation of processors, because the wattage is certainly going higher?\nMichael Hsing: Yes, I can tell you this. Our customers will not be appreciated in talking about how many - dollar per their unit, or GPU unit, okay? And so, then they don't want us to talk about it. And second, I don't know, I don't want to know about it.\nChris Caso: Okay. Understand, but I mean, in just in terms of the opportunity, maybe you could speak in more general terms about the opportunity that's available to you?\nMichael Hsing: Oh, sure, yes. And now you look at our revenues, right? Okay, for a couple of companies, okay, and from last year, was like a what, it's a 1% or 2%, or maybe last year's, okay, couple of percentage our total revenue. Well, today, so like we're running like a what, 20%? And 20%, so that's a full $500 million, okay? And we were told this is at the beginning. And there's a lot of other companies, like where our opportunities and our design wing hasn't really ramped up in company like Google's and AWS and Meta. And those coming later. So I see the huge opportunities and I do see, okay, this is not MPS only, but the market's way too big. We don't want to turn into an AI company only.\nChris Caso: Yes, I think the only thing I'd probably had on top of that besides for the direct AI opportunity, I think you've heard us talk about the AI trickle-down effect, whether that can be memory, it can be optical, it can be pulled through of networking. I think there's a lot of opportunity for MPS, beyond even the direct AI business?\nMichael Hsing: That's a good comment, yes.\nChris Caso: Right, appreciate those comments. Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Tore, your line is now open.\nTore Svanberg: Yes, thank you, Michael, Bernie. And congrats again on another stellar quarter. I wanted to follow-up on enterprise data, but I'm going to move away from the processor power management, and ask you more about opportunities elsewhere in the data center, especially power supply. I know historically you haven't talked a whole lot about GAN, silicon carbide, but I'm pretty sure you have some activities there. So can you elaborate a little bit on what you're doing on the power supply side of data centers?\nMichael Hsing: Yes, I like that one. Okay, I like that one. But I can't tell you the revenue yet, but it's a small, okay? And we, in the since 2016, and again, we start to develop our own silicon carbide. We're not selling expense. It will be a part of our solutions. I said very, very early, so we're not intending to sell a fit [ph] as a power device only. So now, we designed those three kilowatt, six kilowatt, 12 kilowatt power supply. And you guess what? It's a data center. It's a data evaluating, so we have a very little revenues, but the biggest is the MPS only, owned. All our test plot, we're using a huge amount of power supply, and MPS is our own customers. All these testing equipment that we have to design, we have to invent it, how to test these modules particularly, and also as well as burning. And MPS supply these power modules to our vendors, and our vendors are in problem went into these systems and it became our test equipment. And so, that's the revenues we start to generating. And but for 4G and for data centers, and these are still in the, well, we engage them a year ago or so, couple years ago. And so, the revenues small, but we're looking for the big revenues from that segment, because MPS provides the highest efficiency and the smaller size.\nTore Svanberg: Yes, that's great perspective. As my follow-up, I recall, because we've gone through a few cycles together, I recall usually you use downturns to gain a lot of share. I know everyone's excited about data centers today, but what are some of the areas, where you're starting to see more meaningful share gains from a designer perspective, now that we're sort of navigating here at the bottom of the cycle?\nBernie Blegen: Sure, so I think that we've been very clear about the positioning that we have an automotive, and how that's continuing to grow across multitude of different platforms with a multitude of different Tier 1 suppliers and OEMs. I think the most recent area for improvement where somebody's Greenfield opportunities, are becoming more visible in market, would be in particular with communications. We're seeing that in the wireless and 5G, and I think that we've seen some early indications of continuing investment in that segment. So I'd say that's probably the area that will be most visible, but obviously I don't want to forget industrial, which even though right now, is a relatively modest part of our business. And it's not shown a lot of momentum towards growth, probably is the next area, where we have a lot of Greenfield opportunities that will materialize in the next four quarters.\nMichael Hsing: Yes, go ahead.\nTore Svanberg: Yes, I was just going to ask, and the RV market, is that going to be under auto or industrial?\nMichael Hsing: RV?\nTore Svanberg: The RV market, the Kemppi car market, I know you've talked about that?\nMichael Hsing: Oh yes. No, no. Yes, okay. That's one of my favorite ones. Okay, yes, okay. And I think it's going to be in industrial market. Because share - all these products share the same signatures as we do for data centers for our own test plot and for test equipment, okay? We'll be very much shared the same characteristics and also for robotics. And especially for those moving, not stationary robot. And these robots move around, and they all need that type of a power supply and the charging and the battery management. And these all share very much the same characteristics as RVs, okay RVs happen.\nTore Svanberg: Yes, those could be industrial or consumer or even the humanoid stuff too. So I don't think I want to just put those...?\nMichael Hsing: I think it's a - we're probably in the industrial side. Yes, okay, yes.\nTore Svanberg: Sounds good. Thank you and congrats again.\nMichael Hsing: Okay. Thanks, Tore.\nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. Quinn, your line is now open.\nQuinn Bolton: Hi guys, just wanted to add a quick follow-up question. There have been a few semiconductor companies this earnings season that have sort of mentioned having licenses to - Huawei being revoked in the quarter. And it's raised some questions from investors. I just wondering if you guys could address do you have a license to ship to Huawei? If you did, has it been revoked? Is that, is there any real exposure at MPS to that customer? It's obviously not impacting your near-term outlook, but I figured I just asked, because we've gotten a number of questions on potential Huawei exposure, across the semi coverage? Thank you.\nBernie Blegen: Quinn, I can make this pretty simple. We don't have any licensing or contractual arrangements with Huawei that are at all. So they can't be canceled. Any business we have with them has always just done on a PO basis, and we have no indication of a change in their relationship.\nQuinn Bolton: So Bernie, I guess there was more that export license question. Do you need an export license to ship to them? I think that's what's sort of price?\nMichael Hsing: Yes, our product is not, not like in the 20, below 24 nanometer or whatever, that we are not, as far as I know.\nBernie Blegen: Yes, you're right.\nMichael Hsing: And as far as I know, we're not subjected to the export limit, have any limitations. And, but we will talk to our, to answer your question precisely, I will consult our legal counsels.\nQuinn Bolton: Yes, okay. Okay. Thank you.\nGenevieve Cunningham: [Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions, I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.\nBernie Blegen: Great. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call, and look forward to talking to you again during our third quarter conference call, which will likely be in late October. Thank you, have a nice day.",

            "name": "Bernie Blegen",
            "content": "Thanks, Gen. Good afternoon, and a big welcome to all of you. Let me open by saying MPS reported yet another record quarter with Q2, 2024 revenue of $507.4 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance. Our strong revenue growth was attributed to three factors, increased demand for AI power solutions, improving order trends in several of our end markets. And lastly, initial revenue ramps associated with design wins secured in past years. Separately, we continue to expand and diversify our global supply chain, to ensure supply stability and capture future growth. As we have emphasized for many years, our results reflect continued success of our proven long-term growth strategy, and our transformation from being only a chip supplier, to a full solutions provider. I will now open the webinar up for questions. Gen, could you please ask the first caller? Sure, I'll keep my comments fairly short as far as the Q3 outlook by end market. Essentially, the bookings trend that we carried into Q3 has improved quite a bit over the last few quarters, and has been fairly broad as far as the end market participation. If you look specifically at enterprise data, you'll see that we took a fairly large step up in each of the last two quarters. And then in the third quarter outlook, we see continued growth in communications, storage and computing with incremental improvements and also in our other groups. Dustin, I apologize. This is Bernie. I didn't hear which two markets. Yes, I think the near term outlook for automotive remains a little bit fuzzy. And for example, in Q2, we were expecting a nice uplift, which did not occur. And so Michael's correct is that positioning within the next two, three quarters, is hard to predict for auto more broadly and EV specifically, but our long-term positioning is only getting better with additional design wins. And Will, if I could just add two comments quickly. The first is, and this is specific to your question, that it's across all of our markets. It primarily focuses on those that have longer design cycles, where we can add expertise in design solution. And the second point is again, while we are driving a lot, a higher percentage of our business to the modules, or to the more complete solutions. We have the ability, like no other company to be able to deliver the type of solution our customer wants, whether it's a die, a chip or some package in between. On the enterprise data, the way I tried to tee that up, first off, yes, it is expected to grow, but we have grown significantly each of the four prior quarters to this. So the rate of growth is slowing down. And the biggest for this quarter only. And I offer that because there's a lot of opportunities that have yet to begin to ramp with a number of the different companies that we're currently working on designs with. But I was calling out in particular that both storage and computing and communications will be good drivers in Q3. And particularly in the second half of this year, it looks like that segment is starting to take off. And Quinn, if I could also add to this that, the necessity for the different deliveries of power, is as you get into increasingly higher current and in addition to either lateral or vertical power, we also have liquid cooled that, we believe that we have a position on. Chris, can you hear us? Sure, so I think that we've been very clear about the positioning that we have an automotive, and how that's continuing to grow across multitude of different platforms with a multitude of different Tier 1 suppliers and OEMs. I think the most recent area for improvement where somebody's Greenfield opportunities, are becoming more visible in market, would be in particular with communications. We're seeing that in the wireless and 5G, and I think that we've seen some early indications of continuing investment in that segment. So I'd say that's probably the area that will be most visible, but obviously I don't want to forget industrial, which even though right now, is a relatively modest part of our business. And it's not shown a lot of momentum towards growth, probably is the next area, where we have a lot of Greenfield opportunities that will materialize in the next four quarters. Quinn, I can make this pretty simple. We don't have any licensing or contractual arrangements with Huawei that are at all. So they can't be canceled. Any business we have with them has always just done on a PO basis, and we have no indication of a change in their relationship. Yes, you're right. Great. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference call, and look forward to talking to you again during our third quarter conference call, which will likely be in late October. Thank you, have a nice day."

            "name": "Michael Hsing",
            "content": "Yes, your second question, as Bernie said it, we do see some of our - other business would not relate to AI. And now it is difficult to separate AI, non-AI. Other business we designed in which we - let's say that, okay we ship these products to the half a year ago. A year before we see the market start to wakening up. But that's whatever it is, whatever it is, okay. And we do see a lot of new design, new requirement, which is much higher power, for especially for communications. And well, as a matter of fact, as across the board. And these designs are much higher power than the previous versions. And these are all relate to the new design, relate to AI - and AI requirements. And these design wings, we'll probably triggered downs in a game of two [ph] or three years, and change of revenues. Okay. Yes. We do start to ship in the gate [ph] and the product for the higher powers and for data centers. And this is only the beginning. And would you say that that's very true? Auto is being known and we, when ADAS and became more, more and more the cars converged into the ADAS, okay. And which we believe in being a two or three years, all the cars will have that features. And we, so far we provide all the, we have design wing in all these car makers, especially in the EVs. Well, we cannot pick the, you want to pick the models and gave me, and you want to pick them, I can't give you a model. My accuracy is a plus minus 12 months. And going forward, we are very confident. I like that question. Yes, okay. As we said, we started that journey long time ago, okay. And at the beginning, maybe I didn't know, we didn't know what the hell we were talking about. And okay, but that's the directions. And that's including a part of e-commerce. And we sell plug and play solutions. So the effort is that the journey will be, we are, we known to be a semiconductor company. And yes, we do. We do all that we provide. And when we sell a silicon, we're selling, actually we're selling a solutions. We know all the technical details in terms of how we implement the solutions. So my effort is we want to monetize all our knowledges. MPS in the end, doesn't make any things. And we all making the money from our knowledge. While we capitalize all the entire our capabilities. And so the journey we started, now we're selling the solutions. It's probably 20%, 25% of a total MPS total revenue. Every piece of a silicon used to be selling somewhere between $1 and $0.50 to $1. Some of them are a lot of them even lower for the mass market. And which we kind of vary little now, especially in consumer business. And now, we're turning to a solution company is still a semiconductor based solutions. We sell those solutions. Now particularly as you call it, as a modules. And like I don't know what the appropriate word for that. And so today is 25%, 20% to 25% of a total revenues. MPS module business excluding AI. We're running a couple hundred, close to $200 million. And we're growing every year by more than company's percentage growth. And if you look at this, this way, every chip we sell, all the solution is more than a chip price. And you generally $4, $5, $6, $10 of a content that we can sell. So that's the result of today. And we will commit on the journeys. And again, we're transforming a company to a silicon only, to silicon based solution providers. Yes, and many -- maybe traditional semiconductor companies and they are hard to distinguish, whether they're solution providers or selling modules, selling solutions or selling semiconductor only. And that's especially the case and apply for AI powers. And there's a very few company using a silicon based, the module solution to power up this AI solution or data centers. We are - in the leading positions. Okay, I said it - and there's maybe one, I will say the one or two company. Maybe one company have the capability have - and similar to MPS, the market is huge and it's growing. And MPS is, what the leading position, is because not by one day, like one-or-one an AI happened, we developed that years ago for that. And there's not many semiconductor companies that are based at the semiconductor company have that kind of a capability. Quinn, you know VR 13.5 and we start to have a significant revenues. And that was the beginning, you know that. And VR 14, which hasn't really ramped up yet. And we have a lot of design, we increase it. VR 13.5 is like a MPS -- MPS is a test case. And so when during the shortage, okay, a lot of revenues, a lot of volumes shifted to MPS. And our competitors couldn't deliver, we delivered and we delivered. And now the benefit it is - for VR 14, where will be a significant players in the market segment? Go ahead. Yes, you're right.

And second, I don't know, I don't want to know about it. Oh, sure, yes. And now you look at our revenues, right? Okay, for a couple of companies, okay, and from last year, was like a what, it's a 1% or 2%, or maybe last year's, okay, couple of percentage our total revenue. Well, today, so like we're running like a what, 20%? And 20%, so that's a full $500 million, okay? And we were told this is at the beginning. And there's a lot of other companies, like where our opportunities and our design wing hasn't really ramped up in company like Google's and AWS and Meta. And those coming later.

My name is Genevieve Cunningham, and I will be the moderator for this webinar.\n Joining me today are Michael Hsing, CEO and Founder of MPS; Bernie Blegen, EVP and CFO; and Tony Balow, VP of Finance.\n Earlier today, along with our earnings announcement, MPS released written commentary on the results of our operations. Both of these documents can be found on our website.\n Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that in the course of today's presentation, we may make forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements are identified in the safe harbor statements contained in the Q1 earnings release and in our latest SEC filings, including our Form 10-K, which can be found on our website. Our statements are made as of today, and we assume no obligation to update this information.\n Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bernie. \nBernie Blegen: Thanks, Gen. We're doing something a little different in today's earnings call. As a detailed recital performance metrics is included in the company's earnings commentary, accompanying the earnings release, I'll use this time to provide just a few comments on our Q1 2024 performance and our outlook before opening the call up to Q&A.\n Our financial performance improved in the first quarter of 2024 with revenue up both sequentially from Q4 '23 and year-over-year from Q1 '23, Ordering patterns consistently trended upwards through the quarter. Visibility into the second half of 2024, however, is limited and many of our customers remain cautious.\n Despite this uncertainty around the second half of 2024, customer engagement across all of our end markets remains high, and our design win pipeline continues to grow stronger. Additionally, we are continuing to expand our product portfolio and diversify our supply chain globally. We believe both actions position our company for further growth as the market improves.\n In summary, we saw consistent improvement through the first quarter, but we continue to be cautious about the second half of 2024 business conditions. Overall, our proven long-term growth strategy remains intact, and we can swiftly adapt to market changes as they occur.\n I'll now open the webinar up for questions. \nGenevieve Cunningham: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. \nTore Svanberg: Congratulations on this enviable consistency. I have two questions. My first question is on share gains. And historically, Michael, Monolithic Power tends to really accelerate share gains during downturns. And I know there's a lot of focus on Enterprise Data right now, which is 1/3 of your revenue, but -- can you maybe call out some other verticals or applications where you are seeing more share gains in the current downturn? \nMichael R. Hsing: Clearly, we just wait -- if we haven't out of this downturn. You see this, we compare the rest of the industries, we're like a 10% up. And -- so that's really a share gained. And so in terms of -- so the rest of vertical market as auto is clearly is the one. We won many sockets in there. And MPS is still small compared to all these established -- our competitors.\n And other ones, even other ones -- even the servers and notebooks areas and these are the ones, all gain shares. And the last one is the consumer, as we said it a year ago or so, we gave it up some of the shares because of the capacity constraints. Now, we have a lot more capacity now and you will see some growth in the near future. \nBernie Blegen: And if I could add one additional comment there is that we've had a number of greenfield opportunities that have been waiting to launch in an improved macro environment. So in addition to the end markets that Michael just referenced, I think that you'll also see share gains in both communications and industrial. \nTore Svanberg: Great. And for my follow-up question and specifically on Enterprise Data, which is now 1/3 of our revenues. There's been some chatter lately about lower power management content in next-generation AI data centers due to liquid cooling and other techniques to lower overall power. Is this impacting MPS broadly? Or is this kind of more sort of a very specific use case in the server power management market? \nMichael R. Hsing: All these cooling systems, the new format or vertical powers, MPS involve all of them. And if they transition to those markets, those systems -- and MPS in the same gains, okay? We will gain -- and we will grow with it. Is there any other comment? Tony? Okay. \nBernie Blegen: No, I think that the point that we've demonstrated, particularly with Enterprise Data is the ability to leverage up content as we go into higher-value technology. For example, the water cooled and vertical represent opportunities, not threats. And if you look down the line not to -- not far out, we'll also be going into rack power as well. \nMichael R. Hsing: That's good. Yes, good answer. \nOperator: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton of Needham. \nQuinn Bolton: I'll add my congratulations on very steady performance in a challenging macro environment. I guess I wanted to follow up on Tore's question on enterprise data. Lots of your competitors making noise about perhaps gaining share at your largest enterprise data customer. I'm wondering if you could just sort of address your latest thoughts on competitive landscape in both lateral power and then perhaps looking forward to vertical power? And then I've got a follow-up. \nMichael R. Hsing: Yes. As you may remember, 2016, we have a power curve versus -- the power curve CPU computing capabilities and versus the power densities. And we projected it for 2018 or '19. That would be the crossover point that MPS product. And for those common footprint, driver [ mass ] couldn't fit into the peripheral powers. That's around 700 watts. If you remember that in 2016, we said that. And at the time, we projected with the CPU was wrong. It's actually turned out to be GPUs. But the power is the power, power densities.\n And -- but 2018 or '19 -- and that's pretty much the peripheral power that reach the limit. And now from that time -- and everybody goes to a vertical for even higher power AI computations or learning. So all over these power go to verticals.\n And peripheral powers reached the limit. And I can't comment on our competitors, okay, so far, MPS, well, as always, we want to bring the best technologies. And we are not a champion of volumes, okay? We don't do that. We want to every -- whatever we do, we do the best. And not the volumes that we ship.\n And -- so when the market became normalized and became a normal -- not like the last couple -- last year or so. And there will be more -- more solution come on board. A lot of our competitors start to copy our products, so be it. That's fine. So we are -- we stick our MPS model, we will have a very diversified growth. \nBernie Blegen: I think it's important to keep in mind when you look at our history, as Michael just referenced there, that we have always won opportunities due to our innovation. And as we look at the next generation of GPU or TPU or ASIC products that are in this high power end market. We're an enabling technology meaning that at the front of the design cycle, we're consulted, we're integrated, in fact, with the development of the next generation of products. So we believe that strategically that, yes, there will be competitive influences on the market but we want to continue to position ourselves as the leader. \nQuinn Bolton: Got it. Maybe just a quick follow-up. Just any comments you guys have on when you think vertical power may go to volume production? Is that something that happens later in '24? Is that not in volume until sometime in 2025?\n And then the follow-up, Bernie, is you look at the consensus estimates, the Street's modeled up 9% sequential growth in your December quarter. Your typical seasonality, I think, is down 1% to 3%. Wondering if you have any comments as to that sort of a-seasonal pattern out in Q4? I know you're not guiding out that far, but wondering if you could make any comments about that sort of atypical growth. \nMichael R. Hsing: I'll answer the first part of it. And the vertical power is happening now. There's multiple of our customers, they are launching the vertical power now and we are shipping those products. \nBernie Blegen: Yes. And I'll pick up the second part of your question there is that seasonality, particularly as you are exiting a downturn is hard to predict. And what we tried to indicate with our prepared comments is that there are signs of optimism from the standpoint of improved ordering patterns. But how that translates into the second half is hard to predict.\n And so we have more of a profile of the guide that we've given for Q2. But that really as far as the difference between Q3 and Q4, we see them higher than Q2 perhaps. But between the two of them, flattish. \nMichael R. Hsing: Yes. We see AI probably still continue to grow and grow very fast rate. \nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer. \nRichard Schafer: My congratulations guys, and I just had a couple of questions. The first one just since we're talking about power, and I sort of have a point in one on server CPU power. Some of the new x86 platforms that are due out later this year are pushing 500 watts. I mean is there an expectation? Just like the call you made back in 2016, maybe that was a little premature. But is there expectation that x86 is eventually going to move to 48-volt still?\n And if so, I guess, where are we in that transition? How far off do you think that is? \nMichael R. Hsing: Yes. Okay. Now since you mentioned 2016, I can go back to earlier. 2014 we were not even -- we were outside the door, in 2016, we can join, we were invited as a guest. And we gave some tokens so you can play it. And so the transitions and from VR 13.5 to 14, then this type -- this time, when these new CPU power, we have a significant market share. That will keep -- and it's not reflected into revenue yet. And once those CPU release, we will gain a significant amount of shares. \nRichard Schafer: And any comment, Michael, on the transition to 48-volt power for X86? \nMichael R. Hsing: That we don't -- that's probably -- the higher powers is over 700 watts. I think those will transition to vertical powers. And -- which were ready and other ones below that, we believe, are still using a traditional rack power that came in and use 12-volt supply. \nRichard Schafer: Got it. And just as a follow-up, shifting gears a little bit to auto. I was just curious what your expectations are for your auto business this year? Obviously, that market is under a little bit of pressure near term. But I believe you guys have been pretty open about some of your material share gains.\n For instance, with China, within China, ADAS also with some of your top auto -- you with your top auto customer. You've also got some pretty significant share gains, I believe, ramping later this year, but I was curious if you could provide any update there. \nMichael R. Hsing: We saw - yes, go ahead. \nRichard Schafer: I just was curious if you could add in there, what your expectations are from -- I know you had a couple of launches that some OEMs delayed in the second half last year, and I didn't know if you still expect it to benefit from those this year. I know that's kind of a lot in one question, but there's a lot going on in your auto business. \nMichael R. Hsing: Yes, certainly. We actually care less with the share gain, what the revenue expectations. Of course, we have to prepare all the inventories, okay -- and that's the only thing we care. Whatever this or whatever it is, okay. We want to do -- if we're not -- if we're not the best, we will not win those market segments. And particularly, these are new applications and new features.\n So far, we can tell you -- in this year's or end of the last year's, and Chinese EV makers, they produce a lot more. And with those features that we are in, they export it in -- not to U.S., but to the other possible world, they increased somewhere 5 million to 6 million units, okay, million cars. And that's where we see the upside so far. \nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. \nRoss Seymore: Congratulations on the stability. Just a question on the visibility into the second half. I understand the caution, especially given everything going on in the broader market. But you also said that your bookings are improving, the order rates, the engagements, et cetera, et cetera. So is the visibility improving? It's just not as good as it used to be? I'm just trying to reconcile the bookings side improving, but the visibility not. \nBernie Blegen: Sure, Ross. If we can kind of reflect that over the course of about the last 6 quarters, ordering patterns have been well below whatever we call normal. And when we're seeing improvement, doesn't mean that we're seeing that they have necessarily stabilized or that they're as predictive as when you have like 5 or 6 consecutive quarters of strong ordering patterns. So all we're trying to do right now is remain cautiously optimistic. \nTony Balow: Ross, it's Tony. The only thing I'd probably add on that, right, is really focused on the design win engagement, making sure that pipeline is healthy because it's difficult to call when the market would come back. As Bernie said, it's still pretty choppy. But if we have that strong design win pipeline as well as having the supply chain diversification we were talking about, we're set to take advantage when the markets do come back. \nRoss Seymore: I guess as my one follow-up, a near-term question for you. Any outliers in the growth that you're guiding to in the second quarter by end market segments versus the 7% total? \nMichael R. Hsing: No. Outliers means like AI stuff, Yes. As I said earlier, we still -- we still see a lot of growth, okay? I mean we are getting -- try to get all the inventory ready, okay, start to go even further, okay, and they even have a lot more upside. \nBernie Blegen: Yes. If I look sequentially between Q2 and Q1, we do see the continuing demand profile for Enterprise Data. And I think we see also some contribution from Automotive, but the rest of our end markets are pretty flattish. \nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist. \nWilliam Stein: Congrats on the good results, and thanks for the change in format. It's a breath of fresh air. \nMichael R. Hsing: And -- you appreciate it. We try to make it life and make it easy for you. \nWilliam Stein: I'm hoping you can update us on the progress you pursued to try to diversify your manufacturing geographic footprint and both on the front end and back end? And then I have a follow-up, please. \nTony Balow: Yes, I'll start, and then I'll let Michael and Bernie pick up. So I think we continue to make progress on diversification of our supply chain globally. And so I think that is proceeding as planned. And I think that we're set as customers would ask for that capability that we have it ready for them right now. So I think based on what we said in the past, so I would say no change in the expectation there. So Bernie or Michael, anything you want to add? \nMichael R. Hsing: Yes. We built all these capacities our customer demands, okay. There's a few of them that really demand a lot outside of China. So we have more capacity. So that's the comment. Okay. \nWilliam Stein: Okay. Let me try a different topic. Some product types that I know have been ramping maybe over a long period of time. One is converter -- data converters, which is a category, there's -- I think there's really one very dominant supplier, but you guys have started to get into that area. And then the other is the modules that you make when these are much more complex and they have many, many chips, I think, in each one. If you can talk to us about the recent growth in those newer categories, that would be helpful color. \nMichael R. Hsing: Yes. Okay. Let me answer the first ones, data converter -- data converters are -- it's a technology that we're talking about, we developed in the last few years. And we want design win, we start to shipping products, and -- but however, there's only 1 or 2 products, okay? And now we're going to release a family of a product in less than a year, less than a year time. That will meet a more general market.\n The other topic that's when you're talking about -- these modules. Yes, so called e-commerce modules, and we're actually doing well, okay, not exactly the e-commerce we talk about in 2018. And it's going over well over $100 million, okay. I mean -- but these are multi-chip modules is more than $100 million. Actually, all these AI products that we're shipping these all modules. And vertical powers and also the rack powers. We're shipping all these modules. So  I -- in the past, I say -- I said and I'm sick and tired of selling silicon only. I want to leverage -- our leverage and monetize, our know-how will sell these power modules sales solutions. \nBernie Blegen: And I think that we've sort of hit on one of the strategic differentiators between MPS and a lot of our competitors is that we can offer the most flexible architecture of whether it is delivering a module or silicon die, so however the customer wants to build our silicon or modules into their end application, we have the flexibility to do just that. \nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. \nMatthew Ramsay: I guess it's my first question. guys, I wanted you to maybe talk a little bit about the content per socket progression that you see for the company in the AI business, in particular, as your -- silicon providers that are driving these platforms make generational transitions there. I think there's a little bit of confusion that the big primary guy in AI is not just launching 1 product, but they're launching 3 different ones that I expect to have slightly different content. And you obviously have other customers there in AI, not just NVIDIA but others.\n So if you could talk generally, Michael, about just what you're seeing from a content perspective, generation to generation there? And maybe Bernie, what are the variables on sort of blended content increases that you might see as we move forward? \nMichael R. Hsing: Yes. I can't talk about the -- well I don't -- we don't know how our customers -- and these are AI GPU providers, how they use it. I mean, they sell -- they have a different model, they have a different model -- they have a different variety of products. We -- as long as we know, okay, they use some -- they use IC chipping in general for peripheral power and verticals is all more than 700-watt powers, over 1,000-watt power. So these are from modules. And how many modules per CPUs, we have rough ideas, but we don't know exactly. \nBernie Blegen: Yes. And to follow up on your second point, it's a very content-rich environment for us. It also includes memory, for example, and the CPU process -- processor in addition... \nMichael R. Hsing: Or even optical. \nBernie Blegen: An optical as well. So I think it's really too early to put limits on content availability. In fact, we're finding new areas in order to deploy. \nMichael R. Hsing: So far, we just want to handle the growth. All the demand from a memory side from opticals, from even the GPU, CPU powers. And this period is really the growth period. \nMatthew Ramsay: Got it. That's helpful. I know there's a lot of moving parts. I was going to kind of step back and ask a little bit about gross margin trajectory, it comes up a lot in my conversations. I know you're kind of in that 55% range. I guess, Bernie, what are the puts and takes here? I know there are big customers ramping in enterprise data and there are variables around that.\n There's also mix between your segments and where you're sourcing supply from, there's a lot of variables here. So what would -- I mean, are we kind of at a relative floor in the 55% or slightly above range? And what would be the variables that could drive the margin back higher? \nBernie Blegen: Sure. This is a pretty simple question. So as you know, the range that we target is between 55% and 60%. We demonstrated that during the post pandemic stimulus that our margin was able to go to the higher end of that limit. And right now, for the last couple of quarters as well as our guidance here, we've maintained a non-GAAP rate of 55.7%. And really, what will enable us to go up is a change in the mix of business. \nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Gary Mobley of Wells Fargo. \nGary Mobley: Congrats, and thank you for persistently seeing the expectation. Most of the interesting questions have been asked and answered, but I wanted to touch on pricing trends. I know you don't overlap a whole lot with the analog chip market leader. But clearly, they're being aggressive on price. So maybe if you can speak to the different product groups or business segments that might be affected by that? And as well, just generally speak about the pricing environments for your broad set of products. \nMichael R. Hsing: Tony, you want to? \nTony Balow: I'll start and then let Bernie jump in, right, I think what you've heard from us in the past is that for us, because we lead on innovation and we're trying to work on the next-generation platforms and work on where we really have a differentiated advantage to our technology. We're probably less susceptible to pricing than some of the segments that are volume related or might be more mainstream. So I do know there's lots of reports out there about pricing right now. But I'd say right now, that's not impacting us in a way -- that's not impacting us in any way, and you can kind of see that in our outlook. And so Bernie will add some more on that. \nBernie Blegen: Yes. And fundamentally, part of the issue that's driving prices both additional capacity in China as well as additional capacity that's coming on with a large North American company. And on the cost side, we've always been very, very competitive regardless of the end market opportunity and... \nMichael R. Hsing: The cost regardless of what the margin is, we always have to -- we always drive the cost down. I shouldn't give you more than you asked, and it's a little bit from the futures. And so far, have nobody asked the question yet. We saw in the near-term market in the next couple of years, the AI truly trickle down to all applications. not only in the cars, and all -- in the sensors, all these -- in building for the phones and all kind of things trickle down to a different level. And that we see now all kind of activities is going on now.\n And we -- there's a lot of design initial phase performing the product ideas. And these are requested from our customers. And we don't see that in the end of the last year, even in the beginning of this year, recently, we see a lot more. So that will drive -- those products definitely will drive the gross margin up. \nGary Mobley: Thank you for that comprehensive answer. Last quarter, your distribution inventory, I think you characterized it -- I think you characterized the distribution inventory as being a little bit above the target level, what is it now? Have you been able to work that down to more of a normalized level? \nBernie Blegen: Sure. So there's sort of two ways to look at our channel inventory right now. If you keep it narrow to really the AI supply chain, we're trying to keep that elevated so that, that inventory is basically available on demand. But then with regard to all of the other end markets, we've seen it coming down nicely. \nGenevieve Cunningham: Our next question is from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. \nTore Svanberg: I just had two quick follow-ups. I'm intrigued by the consumer segment, Michael, I know that's surprising when everyone is talking about AI. But I think this is the lowest percentage has ever been. But you did talk about getting some share there in the downturn. So any particular applications that we should keep an eye on as you start to grow back in the consumer area? \nMichael R. Hsing: Yes. Okay. That's good question, I mean, yes, that's -- I said earlier that fell into an unhealthy percentage. We want to have a diversified growth, we neglected our consumers. But on the other hand, is during this period, a lot of our competitors care less about cost. We have less effect, but we did lower the price in the notebook market segment. And that's probably you see it now, we grow the notebook revenues faster than notebook market growth. And these are low-margin products.\n But when looking at -- looking forward, audio product. A lot of it related to a consumer product. Maybe, Tony, you can mention -- you can talk about this is okay. \nTony Balow: I'll go and Michael can certainly talk a lot more, but I'd point you back to what we announced last quarter on Axign acquisition. And we really looked at their technology and saw an opportunity to participate in the high-end audio market and MPS's scale and Axign's technology really offered an opportunity to go after customers, and we're seeing some traction in that area. So consumers got a wide base of potential applications, and I think we'll continue to pick our shots where we can sort of really add value with our innovation. \nMichael R. Hsing: Yes. I can tell you, we will start to ship in Q3 but -- Axign and MPS together as a bundle. \nTore Svanberg: Yes. That's exciting. And my last question is on communications. It was actually up sequentially this quarter. Everything that we're hearing, of course, is that, that market is still very weak. In your prepared remarks, you said that, that growth was driven by networks. So can you elaborate a little bit what's going on there? Are you actually starting to see that market turning? Or is this just pure share gains? \nBernie Blegen: It remains a flattish market. I think that in quarter-by-quarter, we're going to see infrastructure go up or down. But the full year outlook is that it will probably be flat with '23. \nMichael R. Hsing: I'm betting on the communication market, it will trickle down from the speed, and demand of higher speed will trickle down all these segments. And we have a lot of design wins in 5Gs or in other high speed or Wi-Fi, and we're ready for that. \nTore Svanberg: So Michael, what you mean is AI will trickle down. And as that happens, the comm sector will revive? \nMichael R. Hsing: That's right. Yes, it has to. That's no brainer. \nGenevieve Cunningham: Our last question is from Melissa Fairbanks of Raymond James. \nMelissa Dailey Fairbanks: Michael, I love a no-brainer. I mean -- I love that. \nMichael R. Hsing: Yes, I don't need my brain to talk about it. \nMelissa Dailey Fairbanks: I'm adjusting my model accordingly. So I know you guys addressed auto earlier, and I know everyone is focused on enterprise data. But I would like to understand better, we're coming up on the model year builds for like model year 2025. I would like to know where you feel comfortable guiding the auto revenue from here? \nBernie Blegen: Yes. So let me take that one. A lot of the exposure we have with new content is with the EV companies. And so Michael touched on the opportunity, particularly as it relates to Chinese OEMs where we have a good installed base, particularly as it relates to ADAS or autonomous driving.\n And those tend not to be as seasonally driven as the internal combustion. So while we're seeing some sequential improvement quarter-by-quarter during the year, we don't necessarily -- we're not looking for that hockey stick that used to occur with automotive sales in Q3. \nGenevieve Cunningham: I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie. \nBernie Blegen: So I'd like to thank you all for joining us on this conference call and look forward to talking to you again during the second quarter conference call, which will likely be in late July. Thank you. Have a nice day.",

            "name": "Bernie Blegen",
            "content": "Thanks, Gen. We're doing something a little different in today's earnings call. As a detailed recital performance metrics is included in the company's earnings commentary, accompanying the earnings release, I'll use this time to provide just a few comments on our Q1 2024 performance and our outlook before opening the call up to Q&A.\n Our financial performance improved in the first quarter of 2024 with revenue up both sequentially from Q4 '23 and year-over-year from Q1 '23, Ordering patterns consistently trended upwards through the quarter. Visibility into the second half of 2024, however, is limited and many of our customers remain cautious.\n Despite this uncertainty around the second half of 2024, customer engagement across all of our end markets remains high, and our design win pipeline continues to grow stronger. Additionally, we are continuing to expand our product portfolio and diversify our supply chain globally. We believe both actions position our company for further growth as the market improves.\n In summary, we saw consistent improvement through the first quarter, but we continue to be cautious about the second half of 2024 business conditions. Overall, our proven long-term growth strategy remains intact, and we can swiftly adapt to market changes as they occur.\n I'll now open the webinar up for questions. And if I could add one additional comment there is that we've had a number of greenfield opportunities that have been waiting to launch in an improved macro environment. So in addition to the end markets that Michael just referenced, I think that you'll also see share gains in both communications and industrial. No, I think that the point that we've demonstrated, particularly with Enterprise Data is the ability to leverage up content as we go into higher-value technology. For example, the water cooled and vertical represent opportunities, not threats. And if you look down the line not to -- not far out, we'll also be going into rack power as well.

But that really as far as the difference between Q3 and Q4, we see them higher than Q2 perhaps. But between the two of them, flattish. Sure, Ross. If we can kind of reflect that over the course of about the last 6 quarters, ordering patterns have been well below whatever we call normal. And when we're seeing improvement, doesn't mean that we're seeing that they have necessarily stabilized or that they're as predictive as when you have like 5 or 6 consecutive quarters of strong ordering patterns. So all we're trying to do right now is remain cautiously optimistic. Yes. If I look sequentially between Q2 and Q1, we do see the continuing demand profile for Enterprise Data. And I think we see also some contribution from Automotive, but the rest of our end markets are pretty flattish. And I think that we've sort of hit on one of the strategic differentiators between MPS and a lot of our competitors is that we can offer the most flexible architecture of whether it is delivering a module or silicon die, so however the customer wants to build our silicon or modules into their end application, we have the flexibility to do just that.

            "content": "Clearly, we just wait -- if we haven't out of this downturn. You see this, we compare the rest of the industries, we're like a 10% up. And -- so that's really a share gained. And so in terms of -- so the rest of vertical market as auto is clearly is the one. We won many sockets in there. And MPS is still small compared to all these established -- our competitors.\n And other ones, even other ones -- even the servers and notebooks areas and these are the ones, all gain shares. And the last one is the consumer, as we said it a year ago or so, we gave it up some of the shares because of the capacity constraints. Now, we have a lot more capacity now and you will see some growth in the near future. All these cooling systems, the new format or vertical powers, MPS involve all of them. And if they transition to those markets, those systems -- and MPS in the same gains, okay? We will gain -- and we will grow with it. Is there any other comment? Tony? Okay. That's good. Yes, good answer. Yes. As you may remember, 2016, we have a power curve versus -- the power curve CPU computing capabilities and versus the power densities. And we projected it for 2018 or '19. That would be the crossover point that MPS product. And for those common footprint, driver [ mass ] couldn't fit into the peripheral powers. That's around 700 watts. If you remember that in 2016, we said that. And at the time, we projected with the CPU was wrong. It's actually turned out to be GPUs. But the power is the power, power densities.\n And -- but 2018 or '19 -- and that's pretty much the peripheral power that reach the limit. And now from that time -- and everybody goes to a vertical for even higher power AI computations or learning. So all over these power go to verticals.\n And peripheral powers reached the limit. And I can't comment on our competitors, okay, so far, MPS, well, as always, we want to bring the best technologies. And we are not a champion of volumes, okay? We don't do that. We want to every -- whatever we do, we do the best. And not the volumes that we ship.\n And -- so when the market became normalized and became a normal -- not like the last couple -- last year or so. And there will be more -- more solution come on board. A lot of our competitors start to copy our products, so be it. That's fine. So we are -- we stick our MPS model, we will have a very diversified growth. I'll answer the first part of it. And the vertical power is happening now. There's multiple of our customers, they are launching the vertical power now and we are shipping those products. Yes. We see AI probably still continue to grow and grow very fast rate. Yes. Okay. Now since you mentioned 2016, I can go back to earlier. 2014 we were not even -- we were outside the door, in 2016, we can join, we were invited as a guest. And we gave some tokens so you can play it. And so the transitions and from VR 13.5 to 14, then this type -- this time, when these new CPU power, we have a significant market share. That will keep -- and it's not reflected into revenue yet. And once those CPU release, we will gain a significant amount of shares. That we don't -- that's probably -- the higher powers is over 700 watts. I think those will transition to vertical powers. And -- which were ready and other ones below that, we believe, are still using a traditional rack power that came in and use 12-volt supply. We saw - yes, go ahead. Yes, certainly. We actually care less with the share gain, what the revenue expectations. Of course, we have to prepare all the inventories, okay -- and that's the only thing we care. Whatever this or whatever it is, okay. We want to do -- if we're not -- if we're not the best, we will not win those market segments. And particularly, these are new applications and new features.\n So far, we can tell you -- in this year's or end of the last year's, and Chinese EV makers, they produce a lot more. And with those features that we are in, they export it in -- not to U.S., but to the other possible world, they increased somewhere 5 million to 6 million units, okay, million cars. And that's where we see the upside so far. No. Outliers means like AI stuff, Yes. As I said earlier, we still -- we still see a lot of growth, okay? I mean we are getting -- try to get all the inventory ready, okay, start to go even further, okay, and they even have a lot more upside. And -- you appreciate it. We try to make it life and make it easy for you. Yes. We built all these capacities our customer demands, okay. There's a few of them that really demand a lot outside of China. So we have more capacity. So that's the comment. Okay. Yes. Okay. Let me answer the first ones, data converter -- data converters are -- it's a technology that we're talking about, we developed in the last few years. And we want design win, we start to shipping products, and -- but however, there's only 1 or 2 products, okay? And now we're going to release a family of a product in less than a year, less than a year time. That will meet a more general market.\n The other topic that's when you're talking about -- these modules. Yes, so called e-commerce modules, and we're actually doing well, okay, not exactly the e-commerce we talk about in 2018. And it's going over well over $100 million, okay. I mean -- but these are multi-chip modules is more than $100 million. Actually, all these AI products that we're shipping these all modules. And vertical powers and also the rack powers. We're shipping all these modules. So  I -- in the past, I say -- I said and I'm sick and tired of selling silicon only. I want to leverage -- our leverage and monetize, our know-how will sell these power modules sales solutions. Yes. I can't talk about the -- well I don't -- we don't know how our customers -- and these are AI GPU providers, how they use it. I mean, they sell -- they have a different model, they have a different model -- they have a different variety of products. We -- as long as we know, okay, they use some -- they use IC chipping in general for peripheral power and verticals is all more than 700-watt powers, over 1,000-watt power. So these are from modules. And how many modules per CPUs, we have rough ideas, but we don't know exactly. Or even optical. So far, we just want to handle the growth. All the demand from a memory side from opticals, from even the GPU, CPU powers. And this period is really the growth period. Tony, you want to? The cost regardless of what the margin is, we always have to -- we always drive the cost down. I shouldn't give you more than you asked, and it's a little bit from the futures. And so far, have nobody asked the question yet. We saw in the near-term market in the next couple of years, the AI truly trickle down to all applications. not only in the cars, and all -- in the sensors, all these -- in building for the phones and all kind of things trickle down to a different level. And that we see now all kind of activities is going on now.\n And we -- there's a lot of design initial phase performing the product ideas. And these are requested from our customers. And we don't see that in the end of the last year, even in the beginning of this year, recently, we see a lot more. So that will drive -- those products definitely will drive the gross margin up. Yes. Okay. That's good question, I mean, yes, that's -- I said earlier that fell into an unhealthy percentage. We want to have a diversified growth, we neglected our consumers. But on the other hand, is during this period, a lot of our competitors care less about cost. We have less effect, but we did lower the price in the notebook market segment. And that's probably you see it now, we grow the notebook revenues faster than notebook market growth. And these are low-margin products.\n But when looking at -- looking forward, audio product. A lot of it related to a consumer product. Maybe, Tony, you can mention -- you can talk about this is okay. Yes. I can tell you, we will start to ship in Q3 but -- Axign and MPS together as a bundle. I'm betting on the communication market, it will trickle down from the speed, and demand of higher speed will trickle down all these segments. And we have a lot of design wins in 5Gs or in other high speed or Wi-Fi, and we're ready for that. That's right. Yes, it has to. That's no brainer. Yes, I don't need my brain to talk about it."

The only thing I'd probably add on that, right, is really focused on the design win engagement, making sure that pipeline is healthy because it's difficult to call when the market would come back. As Bernie said, it's still pretty choppy. But if we have that strong design win pipeline as well as having the supply chain diversification we were talking about, we're set to take advantage when the markets do come back. Yes, I'll start, and then I'll let Michael and Bernie pick up. So I think we continue to make progress on diversification of our supply chain globally. And so I think that is proceeding as planned. And I think that we're set as customers would ask for that capability that we have it ready for them right now. So I think based on what we said in the past, so I would say no change in the expectation there. So Bernie or Michael, anything you want to add? I'll start and then let Bernie jump in, right, I think what you've heard from us in the past is that for us, because we lead on innovation and we're trying to work on the next-generation platforms and work on where we really have a differentiated advantage to our technology. We're probably less susceptible to pricing than some of the segments that are volume related or might be more mainstream. So I do know there's lots of reports out there about pricing right now. But I'd say right now, that's not impacting us in a way -- that's not impacting us in any way, and you can kind of see that in our outlook. And so Bernie will add some more on that. I'll go and Michael can certainly talk a lot more, but I'd point you back to what we announced last quarter on Axign acquisition. And we really looked at their technology and saw an opportunity to participate in the high-end audio market and MPS's scale and Axign's technology really offered an opportunity to go after customers, and we're seeing some traction in that area. So consumers got a wide base of potential applications, and I think we'll continue to pick our shots where we can sort of really add value with our innovation."
