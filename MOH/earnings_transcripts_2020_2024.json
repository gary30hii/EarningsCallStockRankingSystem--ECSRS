I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Julie Trudell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Molina Healthcare. Please go ahead.\nJulie Trudell: Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; our current CFO, Tom Tran, who is retiring later this month; and our current Head of Transformation and Corporate Development and CFO-elect, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our fourth quarter earnings was distributed after the market close yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30-days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made herein or as of today, Thursday, February 11, 2021, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our fourth quarter 2020 press release. During our call, we will be making Forward-Looking Statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the current environment, recent acquisitions, 2021 guidance and our longer-term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report for the 2019 year filed with the SEC, as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and our Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call and take your questions. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Thank you, Julie, and good morning. Today, we will provide updates on several topics. First, we will cover enterprise-wide financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2020; second, we will provide initial earnings and earnings per share guidance for 2021; and lastly, we will conclude with some thoughts on our compelling strategic position and our future growth prospects. Let me start with fourth quarter highlights. Last night, we reported GAAP earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of $0.56 with net income of $34 million and total revenue of $5.2 billion a revenue increase of 22% over the prior year. On a normalized basis, defined as adjusted earnings per share and excluding the net effect of COVID, our earnings per diluted share were $2.29 for the fourth quarter. This is consistent with our performance in the first three quarters of 2020, each of which produced approximately $3 per share, after adjusting for the effect of COVID. Two items significantly impacted the earnings in the fourth quarter. The first and most prominent of these items was the net effect of COVID which decreased net income in the quarter by $3.80 per share. The most significant contributor to this impact was the continuation of rate refunds already in flight and the introduction in the quarter of COVID-related retroactive rate actions in California, Michigan and Ohio. These refunds taken together more than offset the net effect of modest utilization curtailment and a high level of COVID direct cost of care. The second significant item having an impact in the quarter came from adjustments that produced a combined net benefit of $1.07 in earnings per share. The most significant of these was a net benefit from the proceeds of federal litigation which was partially offset by a charitable contribution to our foundation. In summary, we are pleased with our normalized fourth quarter performance with respect to both the continued delivery of solid earnings and the focused execution of our growth strategy. All of this was achieved whilst dealing with the effects of the global pandemic. Now turning to the full-year, we reported full-year 2020 GAAP earnings per diluted share of $11.23, with net income of $673 million and a 3.5% after-tax margin. We generated premium revenue of $18.3 billion, an increase of 13% over 2019 reflecting increased membership. We ended the year with four million managed care members, a 700,000 member increase year-over-year, primarily due to growth in Medicaid. Our Medicaid enrollment finished the year strong at 3.6 million members, representing growth of over 640,000 members or 22% over the prior year. This increase reflects strong organic growth of 450,000 members or 15% as the suspension of redeterminations was the major catalyst for our Medicaid membership growth in 2020. Growth of 370,000 members related to the acquisitions of YourCare, which closed on July 1st and Passport, which closed on September 1st. This organic and inorganic growth was offset by the 180,000 member decline related to our planned exit from Puerto Rico. I will now provide additional color on our full-year normalized financial performance which better expresses the underlying strength of our business by isolating the transitory effects of COVID and adjustments. On a normalized basis, our earnings per diluted share were $12.97 for the full-year. Our normalized performance comfortably exceeded our full-year guidance of $11.20 to $11.70 per share, which was established in the absence of COVID and is therefore the most relevant comparison. With respect to medical margins, for the full-year, our MCR on a normalized basis was 85.9% compared to 85.8% in the prior year. In Medicaid and Medicare, our performance met expectations, while in marketplace, our performance is below our expectations. Our normalized G&A ratio for the year was 7.3% compared to 7.7% in 2019 reflecting disciplined cost management and the benefits of scale produced by our substantial growth. We produced a normalized after-tax margin of 3.9% despite our marketplace business underperforming. We are very pleased that while dealing with the medical cost distortions and operational complexity caused by the pandemic, we produced a normalized margin, consistent with our long-term target. Now I will comment on the item-by-item effects of COVID on our full-year 2020 results. The net effect of COVID increased pre-tax income by approximately $180 million or $2.30 per share. This result is the sum of several identifiable positive and negative factors as follows: For the full-year, the net benefit from COVID-related utilization curtailment, offset by direct care related to COVID patients was approximately $420 million on a pre-tax basis. I should note that while utilization was moderately curtailed in both the fourth quarter and the full-year, in the fourth quarter direct COVID medical costs were higher than in any other quarter of the year. For the year, COVID related risk-sharing corridors reduced premium revenue and earnings by approximately $555 million on a pre-tax basis. $400 million of this amount was reported in the fourth quarter as the three new COVID-related risk-sharing corridors went active and corridors already existing at the end of the third quarter remained in effect. For the year, COVID-related activities increased our G&A spend by approximately $35 million on a pre-tax basis. Without question, the effects of COVID created significant distortions to our 2020 operating metrics, but the underlying operating fundamentals and financial metrics remain strong. Turning to our 2021 guidance beginning with premium revenue, we are very pleased with the rapid activation of our growth strategy. In 2021, we project premium revenue of at least $23 billion, a 25% increase over 2020. This growth is well balanced between a new contract win, organic growth both on acquisition benefit expansions in our existing geographies and greater penetration of our Medicare and Marketplace products into our Medicaid footprint. More specifically, our premium revenue guidance includes a full-year of the acquired Magellan Complete Care businesses, which we closed on December 31st. A full-year of Kentucky revenue, which commenced on September 1, 2020, a full-year of revenue from the YourCare membership in upstate New York, which we assumed on July 1, 2020. Marketplace revenue growth of 25% to 30% as we begin this year with more than 500,000 members. The full-year carve-in of the pharmacy benefit in the state of Washington, which is somewhat offset by a partial year of pharmacy carve-outs in New York and California, and the revenue decrease associated with our planned exit from Puerto Rico. The impact of the Affinity acquisition is not included in our premium revenue guidance. We expect the transaction to close as early as the second quarter, so the acquisition could provide $600 million or more in additional premium revenue in 2021. Our guidance includes membership growth relating to the current public off emergency extension set end in mid-April 2021, with a steady decline over the remainder of the year as redetermination is activated. The Biden administration has recently indicated that it is likely the public health emergency will remain in place for the entirety of the year. If so, states could continue to receive the additional 6.2% FMAP match throughout 2021, which would likewise extend the redetermination suspension requirement for the state. Although we have been adding more than 100,000 Medicaid members per quarter during the redetermination suspension in 2020, it is unclear whether this pattern would continue should PHE be extended further. Therefore, we have not included in our guidance an estimate of revenue associated with additional volumes from potential PAG extensions. However, any extension of the PAG accompanied by redetermination suspension could certainly represent upside to our 2021 revenue outlook. We estimate that for every month, the redetermination suspension is extended past April. It could provide additional revenue of approximately $150 million per month. Turning now to earnings guidance, given our recent and expected continued M&A activity, adjusted earnings per share have become a more relevant measure of our earnings going forward and would be the focus of our comments today. Our initial full-year 2021 adjusted earnings guidance is in the range of $12.50 to $13 per share or approximately 20% growth from 2020 adjusted earnings of $10.57 per share. The upper end of our 2021 guidance range is essentially equal to our 2020 normalized earnings per share of $12.97. Our 2021 earnings profile reflects durable and sustainable operating improvements and earnings growth which are being temporarily muted by a [ephemeral] (Ph) industry-wide challenges. Specifically, our 2021 earnings guidance reflects the following positive long-term value drivers: Continued strong performance in Medicaid and Medicare, reflecting an actuarially sound base rate environment. Margin recovery and growth in our Marketplace business which we target to achieve mid-single-digit pre-tax margins for 2021 as a result of our intense focus on operational improvements and continued competitive prices and product designs; and accretion from the Magellan Complete Care businesses into our Kentucky and Passport installation. Our earnings guidance also considers the following industry-wide environmental challenges, including another net negative impact from COVID, although at a reduced level, due to the continuation of many of the risk-sharing corridors that existed in 2020 and the direct cost of COVID-related patient care, offset by the moderate utilization curtailment. And lower-than-expected Medicare risk scores, which are an industry-wide challenge that would pressure results. Our risk scores do not fully reflect the acuity of our membership as in 2020 seniors reduced their access to health care services and therefore, risks or cash is more challenging. Referencing these catalysts and challenges, we now quantify the progression from our 2020 normalized earnings of $12.97 per share to the midpoint of our 2021 adjusted earnings guidance of $12.75 per share. We expect strong core performance to contribute approximately $1.25 in adjusted earnings per share growth, emerging mostly from Marketplace as Medicaid and Medicare margins are near optimal. And accretion from our acquisitions, along with share repurchases, will positively impact adjusted earnings by approximately $1 per share. Offsetting these positive factors are two industry-wide environmental challenges that temporarily pressure earnings, specifically, we expect the net effect of COVID consisting of utilization curtailment and direct cost of care, offset by risk-sharing corridors to continue to negatively impact earnings, but in 2021 by approximately $1.50 per share. And the temporary Medicare risk score shortfall phenomenon would pressure results by approximately $1 per share. All of these items, when combined with the initial performance of recent acquisitions operating below target margins, impact our 2021 MCR and by approximately 200 basis points when compared to 2020 normalized. This corresponds to a 90 basis point impact on the net income margin. Our 2021 guidance represents solid underlying earnings growth, but it is a constrained picture of the embedded earnings power of the company. The financial profile that we can develop when COVID and industry-related headwinds abate. And when our acquisitions achieve their full run rate potential will include: first, the net effect of COVID in the Medicare risk score disruption has created approximately $2.50 of adjusted earnings per share overhang. We would expect this overhang to disappear as COVID abates. Second, once we obtain our targeted margins on Magellan Complete Care and Kentucky and once Affinity is closed and synergized, we would expect to achieve additional adjusted earnings per share of at least $1.50. In short, our pro forma run rate after the natural relaxation of these temporary constraints, would produce an after-tax margin of approximately 4%, which is in line with our recent performance and produce adjusted earnings per share comfortably in the mid-teens. I will now provide a few concluding comments that frame the compelling strategic position we have created. The execution of our margin sustainability and revenue growth strategy has allowed us to create a very attractive financial profile. Despite all of the near-term distortions caused by COVID, the achievement of our 2021 guidance implies generating EBITDA of $1.2 billion with adjusted EBITDA margins in excess of 5%, producing a return on equity of nearly 40% and which is a function of our attractive margin position and disciplined deployment of growth capital; projecting contribution margin upside as we soon expect to achieve our target margins in our acquired businesses. Generating excess cash flow, which, when combined with leverage, gives us the continued ability to acquire businesses in our quarter; producing a two-year compound annual growth rate of 20%; and to summarize, that the durable earnings catalysts being sustained and as the temporary earnings challenges dissipate, our operating profile would produce mid-teens earnings per share. Despite the challenges and near-term distortions caused by the global pandemic, Our confidence in the growth, earnings power and resilience of our business remains high. The inherent growth characteristics of these businesses are exceptionally strong, and we will execute in harvest growth through winning new states, growing market share in our existing states, increasing penetration in high-acuity populations and actioning accretive acquisitions in our core business. We will continue to sustain best-in-class operating metrics and margins drive the top line growth and remain relentlessly focused on our value-creating mission. I will note that despite the vicissitudes of the economy and despite the pandemic, our management team and our associates have demonstrated tenacity, a determination and an ability to deliver. We are in the right businesses with the right people at the right time. Our future is very bright. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for some additional color on the financials. Tom.\nThomas Tran: Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to discuss our balance sheet, cash flow and 2021 outlook. Operating cash flow for the full-year 2020 was $1.9 billion, reflecting the strong operating result rose membership and the timing of government receipts and payments. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and our reserve position remains strong. Days in claim payable at the end of the quarter represents 50-days of medical cost expense compared to 52-days in the third quarter of 2020 and 50-days in the fourth quarter of 2019. Prior year's reserve development in the fourth quarter of 2020 was modestly favorable and was negligible in the comparable period in 2019. We extract $280 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter and $635 million year-to-date. The parent company cash balance at December 31, 2020, were $644 million, a decrease from the prior quarter cash balance of approximately $1.3 billion, due primarily to the cash outlay for the Magellan Complete Care acquisition. As of December 31, 2020, our health plans had total statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2 billion, which equates to approximately 330% of risk-based capital. Through December 31, 2020, we repurchased an aggregate of approximately 760,000 shares for $159 million. At an average price of approximately $208 per share. We continue to reduce our cost of capital. In November of 2020, we closed on a private offering of $650 million senior notes due November 2030 and used a portion of the proceeds to repay the $330 million senior notes. Debt at the end of the quarter is 2.1 time trailing 12-month EBITDA. Our leverage ratio is 53%. However, On a net debt basis, not a parent company cash, the leverage ratio is 45%. Taken together, these metrics reflect a reasonably conservative leverage position. Now turning to guidance, we introduced our initial full-year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $12.50 to $13. We expect premium revenue to exceed $23 billion a greater than 25% increase over 2020, and total revenue is expected to exceed $24 billion. We expect the medical care ratio to be approximately 88%. The MCR increase over 2020 is primarily due to the continuing net effect of COVID, temporary Medicare risk score disruption and higher MCR from recent acquisitions. We expect our adjusted G&A ratio to improve to approximately 7%. This reflects continued disciplined cost management, revenue growth, and fixed cost leverage. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 25.6%. And adjusted after-tax margin is expected to be approximately 3%, which is impacted by approximately 90 basis points related to the items I just mentioned, including the continuing net effect of COVID, Medicare risk scores and initial performance of recent acquisition operating below target margins. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. please go ahead.\nMatthew Borsch: Yes good morning. I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about the marketplace special enrollment period. And how you expect that to impact you when you take into consideration what you have characterized this underperformance in 2020?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Sure, Matt. Our forecast for membership in the marketplace starting the year with 500,000 ending the year with just under four and a thousand and didn't contemplate the special enrollment period. We are certainly aware of it. We certainly have forecasted what it could provide. And for those 90-days, it couldn't provide anywhere from 20,000 to 30,000 additional members. We are forecasting that potentially it could provide an extra $100 million to $150 million of revenue for the year. Now in the context of our margin recovery process, it is unaffected by that. We are very comfortable with the pricing we put into the marketplace, we are very comfortable with our product designs and our benefit designs, our product positioning, and we are very comfortable in achieving our mid-single-digit pre-tax margins for the year, irrespective of any additional revenue attained to the special enrollment period.\nMatthew Borsch: And maybe if I, just related to that, how much do you think the competitive environment in the marketplace impacts your efforts to get to the mid-single-digit level?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Well, it is very competitive. There is lots of new entrants, but we are very confident. And one of the reasons we are confident is the two areas of operational let down, if you will in 2020, utilization review and attainment risk scores. We have introduced operational excellence of those two operating fundamentals and our other two businesses. We are really good at it in Medicaid and really good at it in Medicare. And we were just behind and importing those skills that exist in our company to the marketplace platform. That has been corrected. And so we are very comfortable that by executing across those two fundamentals, we will get back to mid-single-digit margins.\nMatthew Borsch: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser: Hi, good morning. A couple of questions here. Just thinking about the onetime items in 2021, just to clarify, as we think about 2022, what can we exclude from the sort of temporary onetime headwind? As we think about sort of kind of like the starting point for next year? Because it just a COVID it caused and a number of moving parts in it.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Sure. During our prepared remarks, we gave a sort of a qualitative bridge - quantitative bridge committed bridge and understanding the catalysts and pressures inside our 2021 guidance all with the goal of helping our investors understand what might be looked at as a jumping off point into 2022. So here are the puts and takes. First of all, the net effect of COVID of $1.50 per share or $110 million of pre-tax will dissipate overtime as utilization comes back to normal, as the risk quarters disappear that $1.50 overhead will evaporate as the pandemic is solved. In addition, the Medicare risk score phenomenon, last year was an interesting year. Seniors didn't access health care. And so interacting with them, getting the right codes to attain the right risk force us was a challenge, not just for us, but for many of our competitors. Next year, we will either - meaning this year, we will either attain the risk scores, because they will be getting services, or if we aren\u2019t satisfied that we can, we can include that in our bids. And last year, obviously, the bids were done far before the impact of COVID has ever known. So we are very comfortable that combined at $2.50 overhang sort of disappears as COVID gets behind us. As we said, in addition, our acquisitions are being integrated really, really well, and we are very comfortable with the $1 of accretion that we are putting in this year's guidance, but we are also comfortable in saying, that when they hit their full target margin and when Affinity is closed and hit its target margin, there is an additional $1.50 of earnings per share there. So all in, there is a good $4 of earnings per share embedded power sitting inside our 2021 guidance.\nRicky Goldwasser: And just to follow when we think about the acquisitions, I mean, clearly, you have done multiple acquisitions in 2020. How should we think about sort of management bandwidth to continue to do acquisitions in 2021 or should we think about you kind of taking sort of a pause this year, making sure that they are all integrated getting to the target margin and then coming back to the market?\nJoseph Zubretsky: We have created the bandwidth. We have an expert M&A team that finds the properties and knows how to action them and close them. We have built a world-class integration team. The Passport integration is going really well and the early read on the Magellan integration is going really, really well. That is why we are so comfortable in affirming the accretion targets that we have given you. We have actually very fortunately, laid out quite nicely on a timeline. By the time Magellan is fully integrated, we would just be closing on Affinity, perhaps by the second quarter. And so if we action one, two or who knows how many more this year and they close either late in the year, early next year, the timeline couldn't be more amenable to being very effective at integrating them and harvesting the accretion that we promised our investors.\nRicky Goldwasser: Thank you.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRobert Jones: Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess maybe just two on the bridge and I appreciate you guys breaking out a lot of these components, it looks like the core growth off of that 2020 baseline of $12.97 would be somewhere in the 9.5% range. I'm not sure how much of the HIF benefit would be flowing through. But obviously, that is below the long-term target of 12 to 15. Just wanted to see if you could maybe walk through some of the moving pieces here and probably more importantly, how you are thinking about the timeline to get back into that into that long-term range of 12 to 15.\nJoseph Zubretsky: I want to make sure I understand your question. You are talking about the puts and takes within our 2021 guidance or beyond.\nRobert Jones: Yes. Sorry, just in 2021, it seems like if you look at the core growth that you have laid out in these slides of $1.25 on top of the kind of $12.97, obviously, that would be below the long-term targets. Just curious if you could talk through kind of getting back towards that range. And obviously, it sounds like there are some tailwinds that are not necessarily baked in yet, which I'm sure would be helpful. But I just wanted to get your thoughts on the growth you have laid out here at the core versus getting back to the long-term range.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Sure. Well, bear in mind that the core performance here is irrespective of the net effect of COVID, which is tracked in a different place as the way we have articulated this. So the $1.25 is mostly the marketplace since that was the business that underperformed last year. It was just about breakeven in 2020, and we are targeting mid-single-digit pre-tax. And if you look at the potential for $1.9 billion, $2 billion of revenue, you can start to formulate a picture of how that is a significant contributor to the $1.25 core performance tailwind into this year. There are some puts and takes there, but with Medicare and Medicaid margins where they are, we are going to grow the top line and obtain the margin position there is. But there is not a lot of margin upside in Medicare and Medicaid. So we are very comfortable with the position that we presented here from a core business perspective. Medicare and Medicaid are pretty much optimized with respect to margins. The marketplace as a first step to getting back to where we said we would be. A mid-single-digit pre-tax margin would be our target for 2021.\nRobert Jones: Now, that is super helpful. I guess just one follow-up on the bridge, the dollar you have here for acquisitions and repos, and if I remember, I think you guys had called out $0.50 to $0.75 expected from Magellan. It sounded like YourCare and maybe the Puerto Rico exit would roughly net out. So $0.40 for repo and I think fast forward would be the other swing factor. I guess, first, does that math make sense as far as trying to bridge to that dollar and then how should we think about the split between repo and Passport to make up that $0.40 balance?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Yes, you are generally in the right area. If I were to break apart the dollar, I would say that $0.75 is Magellan, which is the top end of the range that we committed to for the first full-year of ownership, $0.10 on Kentucky. It would be very close to breakeven in the first full-year of ownership, and we will drive it to peak margins after that and about $0.15 on buyback. That is how you get to the dollar.\nRobert Jones: Super helpful. thanks Joe.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCharles Rhyee: Yes, hi thanks for taking the question. Joe, I just wanted to just follow-up to just to clarify one other thing. I apologize if I missed that. When we talk about the net effect of COVID in the $1.50, is that pulling out all the effective COVID you have been for acquisitions? I guess the question is in your assumptions for accretion here in 2021 for something like Kentucky, are you factoring in the impact of COVID or Passport within the acquisition bucket or is it all in the COVID bucket?\nJoseph Zubretsky: We have attempted to capture all COVID impacts in the COVID line item. And just to sort of reframe how we track that, our estimate of COVID impact, is the amount of medical cost suppression we believe we have observed offset by the direct cost of caring for COVID patients. And then, of course, both offset by the impact of any liabilities generated due to the retroactive rate refunds or corridors. That is how we capture it. And if it related to an acquisition is captured in the COVID line.\nCharles Rhyee: Okay, thank you. And just a quick follow-up in Kentucky and Passport, do we have a sense yet on timing for when they are going to do sort of the on enrollment, so you will know what your sort of membership numbers will look like?\nJoseph Zubretsky: In Kentucky, the open enrollment period was extended to March 15th. So there is still members moving around. We began the year with 320,000 members. The latest accounting has us about in that same zone. But on March 15th, the period will shutdown, and we will know how many members that we are beginning our new contract with.\nCharles Rhyee: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nJoseph Zubretsky:\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Hey good morning Joe. I just wanted to make sure I understand what you are saying about your reverification assumptions. So when we look at, for example, the bridge between 2020 and 2021, that $1.25 of core growth, you are saying most of that is from exchanges. But if you are anticipating at this moment that you are still going to have reverifications in mid-year start to take place and some of your Medicaid enrollment rolling off, I'm presuming there is like a net negative number embedded in there. Is that the right way to think about it and I just want to make sure you are suggesting if that doesn't happen this year, whatever the embedded negative number is that comes back and can you size that for us?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Sure. It is interesting because it is all about your assumption of how fast membership roles will attrite once the states turn redetermination back on. But I would tell you, in our numbers, the way the membership flows, both in 2020 and 2021, there is actually a member month increase in 2021, just based on the timing of both acquisitions and redetermination. So no, I would say that the redetermination process is with the 100% upside to our revenue and earnings picture in the year. We just felt it wasn't prudent nor did we have any credible way of estimating how many more members we would get if the redetermination pause was extended, and then how fast would they actually roll off depending on how states plan to implement the reintroduction of the determination. So I would just say that the redetermination issue or phenomenon is upside to both our revenue and earnings guidance for the year.\nGary Taylor: So you have still got enrollment growth playing out now through the first half, some assumptions about some leakage in the second half, but that weighted average is still positive year-over-year.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Yes. The way we look at it on a Medicaid basis, we are beginning the year with 3.6 million members. On January 1st, 200,000 members come over due to MCC. And in the first quarter, based on our historical average of about 30,000 a month during redetermination suspension. We pull in another 100,000 members. It would hit its peak at 3.9, but then 600,000 would roll off in the balance of the year. Now that is a pretty quick roll off, and it might happen slower, which is another perhaps element of conservatism in our forecast. And yes, if you then process that against 2020 and the timing of how membership grew and the timing of our acquisitions, there is actually a 9% number month growth in 2021 on Medicaid.\nGary Taylor: Very helpful. Thank you.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks, good morning. A couple of questions here. First, Joe, a lot of people at JPMorgan got the impression that that the COVID headwind was going to be materially less than the $2. So I'm curious if there is something that happened between then and now to push that number up closer to $2. And then you did a great job of kind of laying out for us the 2020 components within the COVID headwind. Can you do the same for 2021 and specifically on utilization? Can you tell us where you expect COVID cost to be versus normal utilization? Thanks.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Sure, sure, so let's provide the context for 2020. Our estimate of medical cost suppression for the entire year was about $620 million. That was offset by approximately $200 million of the direct cost of COVID care for COVID patients, netting to a $420 million surplus, we hesitate to call it a benefit, a surplus due to the impact on medical costs from the COVID pandemic. And this is not an estimate, it is an actual number, recorded $565 million of rate refunds, risk-sharing quarter of liabilities in the year and that combined with additional G&A of $35 million resulted in a net $180 million cost of COVID in our company for the year, which is $2.30 a share. Juxtaposed against that, to answer now your direct question, we are forecasting a more moderate, more modest level of suppression. And the reason is both the supply and demand side of the health care economy were shutdown last year for a while. Patients were afraid to go in for services. And if they wanted them, there were many executive orders and direct mandates not to provide elective and discretionary procedures. The supply side is open for business this year, but we still think there would be a demand side softening and will result in utilization suppression of somewhere around $200 million for the year, which is one-third of the amount of suppression we experienced in 2020. We will incur direct costs of COVID care. And the net of all that is somewhere between $140 million and $150 million. Most of this, we forecast will happen in the first half of the year. Hopefully, the vaccinations in the vaccine and social distancing will cause all this to really dissipate in the later half of the year. Now against that, we are also forecasting approximately $250 million of impact from retroactive or not retroactive, but risk-sharing quarters, I should say, which nets to about $110 million, which is your $1.50 a share. So the gross numbers are a lot less dramatic, but it is still netting to $1.50 a share. One of the reasons we are very comfortable of this estimate is really we focus on the net impact. Because if utilization is higher or lower than expected, there would be some flex up and down with the risk-sharing corridors. There is actually sort of a natural hedge between the suppression and the corridors themselves. So we look at the net number, we are very comfortable with that net number. And as the pandemic goes away, we think this goes back to normal times, and there would be no impact from COVID on a going-forward basis, obviously. So I hope that helps that tail with tape. I know that was pretty detailed, but that is what's included in our $1.50 estimate for the cost of COVID for 2021.\nJustin Lake: Joe that is really helpful and so what you are seeing here effectively is you have got $110 million risk corridor whole where they are just setting your margins lower than your typical target, and that is really the problem. The other stuff is going to flex up and down, but you are below target here by $110 million. like all of your states at this point have risk corridors, is there any uncertainty around more of them coming on?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Let me address the first part. The answer to the first part, the response is, yes, that is true. If you are already in a risk corridor and your medical costs go up or down, there is no net impact on the company. But that is the way to look at it, that because risk sharing corridors didn't address COVID suppression specifically, it just addressed through MLR, then if you are outperforming your MLR targets, you are getting back some money to the state. So the intention was to have a direct correlation between COVID suppression in a corridor, but the corridor is against medical costs generally. So the fact that we are very profitable in some states, the fact that we outperform many of the market participants in some states, the rate refund number is probably a little higher than people might have expected. But the answer to your second part of your question is correct. It will flex up and down in a state where we are already in a corridor and we are a state where there is not, we would either enjoy the benefits of additional surplus or the effects of additional higher medical costs. The only state that made - the biggest state that does not have a corridor in 2021 is California. Texas and Washington already have done and all of our other states continue them on into 2021.\nJustin Lake: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. First question, Joe, I just wanted to just talk a little conceptually about the long-term margin target. It looks like you gave us a crosswalk back to that 4% level that you had been guiding for us, the long-term view for the last couple of years. And just interested, though, and maybe taking the other side that a bit just in terms of comfort with that sort of longer term, just when we think about the exchange margin profile, you have rebate that since your Investor Day a couple of years ago, you guys are doing more inorganic growth, acquiring lower-margin businesses. So there is sort of a consistent mix impact that will likely come from that. And then also just at some of these risk corridor programs, the states end up liking them a bit light and end up keeping them. So I just wanted to just get your thoughts on sort of framing some of those maybe longer-term headwinds against that 4% long-term target.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Sure, Scott. As we sit here in the second year of this global pandemic, we are not going to update our long-term margin guidance. We are just sort of going to go as you go, as you plow through this, start to form your views of what the landscape is looking like as you plow through it. I think that is the more prudent approach. But having said that, when you actually look at the pro forma impacts of many of these phenomenon that we consider quite temporary, you can pro forma this thing back to the high 3s or close to 4%. To the second part of your question, I actually hope that we always have a decrement sitting inside our margin for acquisitions that do not perform in their first year. That is a good decrement to have because if we can buy properties that are underperforming and with sweat equity, get them to perform, that is just another form of accretion. So the 40 basis points, this 40 basis points in our margin in 2021 in our guidance, that is literally related to the underperformance in the first year of our acquired properties both on the G&A line and on the MCR line. In the last part of your question was related to the risk corridors. Look, when they were introduced in 2020, they were clearly related to pandemic. They were presented that way, they were retroactive because they had to be because they were introduced mostly after the pandemic started. As they were reintroduced for 2021, they were presented as pandemic-related. The feeling was that there could be strange effects from the pandemic additional COVID costs, the cost of the vaccine, additional suppression, and that is why they were introduced on a symmetrical basis. You are protected on the downside and the state is protected on the upside. In CMS' approval guidelines, they have clearly stipulated that when they receive these for approval, they are viewing these as being attributed to the utilization impacts related to the pandemic. So it has been pretty clear to us that they were presented as relating to pandemic. CMS is approving them on the basis of relating to the pandemic. And we believe when the pandemic dissipates that these will disappear as well and will be back to the traditional rate-setting environment where rates are set prospectively using a credible medical cost baseline and a trend off that baseline.\nScott Fidel: Got it. And then just for my follow-up question. I know a lot of this content has just come out in the last day or two, and you guys are probably absorbing it. But just interested, Joe, in sort of your framing on some of the proposals that came out of ways and means on expanding the HIC subsidies and from E&C on some of the Medicaid expansion proposals and how you would frame the opportunity from that? And then I guess also caveated with that because they use reconciliation, the funding for it is only temporary for two-years. So I guess there would be questions on sustainability right at the funding, for example, the Republicans took back it to the House or the Senate in 2022.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Well, thanks for that question. We are only three weeks into the new government and look what has been done. We all knew that the new government would be proponents of the social safety net of making sure the disadvantage have access to high-quality health care and plenty of subsidies so they can afford it. And look what has happened just in the first three weeks in terms of the executive order, at least the intention to extend the PHE to the end of the year. the executive order to introduce the special enrollment period on the marketplace. The executive order that the euphemism in the executive order was encouraging states to look at prior administration policies, which was really taking a shot at the public chargeable and Medicaid work requirements. So just what's come out of the White House in the past three weeks is incredibly bullish on government-sponsored health care, particularly for the disadvantaged. To your other point, things can get done through the reconciliation process and they are going to. The three committees in the house that generally write to health care issues are ways and means energy, e-commerce and oversight. And look at the language that they are introducing, increasing subsidies in the marketplace up to 150% of FPL. Making the product accessible to people over 400%, capping the cost at 8.5% of their income, and so on and so on and so on. Just in three weeks of a new government, both in the legislative bills that are coming out of the House and from Executive order in the White House just couldn't be better for government-sponsored Managed Care, and we are pleased to see that progress already being made.\nScott Fidel: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Windley: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Joe good morning. I wanted to follow on Gary's line of questioning on the redetermination. Last time around that when it was turned back on, there was kind of this realization that the risk profile or the margin on those folks redetermined off was pretty attractive, like maybe even included a lot of zero utilizers. I'm wondering if you think that is likely to happen this time around when that finally gets turned back on. And have you made that assumption in your guidance or in your estimates?\nJoseph Zubretsky: The answer to your last part of your question, Dave, is no, we haven't. But it still remains to be seen what it does to the acuity of the population. Now because we haven't introduced many more members in our forecast, so our guidance only includes 100,000 member growth in the first quarter of the year and then the attrition starts in the last three quarters of the year. But we certainly have not forecasted a continued softening of the acuity profile of our membership base. And in fact, if that in fact happens, and it happens in a quarter, say, it will go back against corridors anyway. So net-net, The impact of the extension of the redetermination suspension is a net positive, on any dimension, it is a net positive to our guidance. We did not include any members past the first quarter, we rolled them off pretty quickly. As I said in my prepared remarks, if you take 500,000 members, which is sort of what we got in redetermination for every month at $300 PMPM there is $150 million of additional revenue. What is the margin profile of that revenue, you can speculate that it is very, very good as the acuity population improves as you get more members. But we have not included any of that impact in our guidance for the year, either the membership flow or a acuity improvement that is sort of a positive jolt to our earnings and earnings per share.\nDavid Windley: Okay. And follow-up then, separate topic. As you think about to your comments earlier on having built the bandwidth and the integration team to continue to look at M&A, as you look at targets, does a thought around the balance of how you would like to build your book of business influence what you are looking at, i.e. increasing MA and - well, really MA, I guess, from an acquisition standpoint, in your mix or is it more opportunistic and what looks the best? How do you think about the balance of your book as it relates to inorganic growth?\nJoseph Zubretsky: We would love to balance it out with more Medicare. They are hard to find. But we would love to balance out with more Medicare. We are growing it nicely organically, but we would love to find properties that have Medicare Advantage or D-SNP populations. I would say along the lines you have asked the question, we more look to the state. Is it a bolt-on within a state where we don't have so much market share that we couldn't get it done? Lighting up new states is really important. High acuity, really important, we are really good at high acuity. And there is a lot of players out there that have a lot of high-acuity lives and have little ability to manage them. So the upside on $1,500 of premium per month is huge, huge margin potential. So I would actually say that the geography is important, we love high acuity. And if they are underperforming but not broken, all the better because then we will take our operating team, open up the Molina playbook and drive accretion through margin expansion.\nDavid Windley: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. Just wanted to make sure that I understand, you talked a lot about redeterminations this year. But I guess in theory, it is a headwind in 2022 guidance. It is not something that you guys spiked out as something that would be contrary to that $4 of earnings power. I wasn't sure if that was included in your kind of net COVID number when you thought about 2022 or that is something that we should separately identify if it is separate, are there any other kind of factors we should take into account?\nJoseph Zubretsky: No. I mean, since we did not put the - any impact, if there is a positive impact from redetermination in 2021, since it is not in our guidance, we did not - then, therefore, create a headwind in 2022. So just to be very clear, I appreciate the question, any impact from the extension beyond April of any additional membership or a slower attrition of membership is not in our revenue guidance. And any profit enjoyed by additional member months in 2021 is not in our guidance. So as I said, we are really comfortable to it, there is only upside to 2021 on the redetermination suspension.\nKevin Fischbeck: Well I'm talking about what is in 2021 in your guidance, because you have it going through April and then slowly coming off as the year goes on. So to your point about member months, you will end at your Medicaid enrollment number, but your member months in 2021 will be higher than your 2022 member months just because redeterminations in for the first full quarter and partially rolling off as the year goes on.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Sure, I understand your question. I'm sorry, I apologize I misunderstood your question. No, and again, we weren't giving a specific 2022 outlook. We are more trying to craft the bridge that we gave you as if we are guiding to $13 a share for 2021, sitting inside that is an earnings power that is higher than $13 due to some temporary phenomenon. But we weren't necessarily trying to extend into 2022 with an earnings or revenue bridge. Sorry, I misunderstood your initial question. But now that will come at a later date.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay, so that is something else we should factor in to think about earnings power then?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Sure, unless the suspension goes on and members stay on through the end of 2021, depending on other acquisitions that we might do, then there is the Affinity piece that is coming in. So we are not doing a 2022 guidance bridge per se. But I understand your question, and it is a legitimate one.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay and then maybe just a second question, then the exchanges, it is obviously unusual to see a company grow very quickly and expand margins the way that you guys did. Obviously, it sounds like risk coding is part of it. But how should we think about that business? is 2021 guidance normalized margin? And how do you think about long-term the top line growth outlook for exchanges?\nJoseph Zubretsky: We are going to be guarded in giving a forecast of where the margins will land. The competitive landscape changes every day. We are very comfortable in getting this to mid-single-digit pre-tax this year. Now our hope, again, given the competitive landscape, that would lead to mid-single-digit after-tax in the future. That is where we think the business could perform. But let's work through the 2021. There is a lot of revenue to bring on, a lot of members to service. Some of them are new. We will have to get their risk scores. So one step at a time, I asked my team, let's get to the mid-single-digit pre-tax margin this year. And then as we prepare our bids for 2022, let's sort through how much margin we think we can get and how much membership we think we can get. But starting the year with 500,000 and a 25% to 30% revenue growth year-over-year was a nice start to get back in the game in this business.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Alright, thanks.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Raskin: Thanks. Good morning. A question on the Medicare risk or headwind of the dollar per share, I sort of calculate that to about 3% of your total Medicare revenues which seems a little bit higher than I think what some others are suggesting. So I guess my question would be how much of your overall Medicare premium dollar actually comes from risk adjusters? And then are there any actions you are taking sort of shorter term to try and improve that risk scoring this year as you sort of get ready for next year and to the bids in the middle of the year?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Yes, Josh, truth be told in that dollar is a little bit from the physician fee schedule. So we just didn't think it was that big enough to call out. So there is a little bit of physician fee schedule in there. But you are in the right zone, 2.5% to 3%, our risk score revenue is multiples of that, two to three times that at least from what I recall. And the industry had a choice last year. We are in the middle of the pandemic, it just started in March and April. We are now starting to develop your bid. And for the most part, while we always tend to be conservative in our bids, we didn't put any specific load for, okay, we are going to fall short on risk scores. Obviously, with hindsight, that cost us three points on the revenue line. But next year, meaning this year, we will either have an estimate of what we think we can attain, and then based on what we target for benefit design and our margins, we would then allow for that in the bid we submit. So either way, whether we get the risk for or whether we price to it, we think this is a one-year phenomenon. That is the way we look at it.\nJoshua Raskin: Okay, got it. But it could be as much as a third to even half of your total risk score revenues disappearing this year. That is sort of the math, right?\nJoseph Zubretsky: I think it is about a third. I will check that, but I think it is about a third.\nJoshua Raskin: And then just a quick follow-up on your margins, where did you end 2020 full-year margins in Medicaid and Medicare?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Where did we end? Well, again, depending on whether you look at a normalized basis or not, but, On adjusted earnings for 2020, we are at 3.3% net income margin, normalized 3.9%. And I would tell you that the individual margins for the lines of business were generally in line with our long-term targets. So 3.3% adjusted, 3.9% normalized, and the lines of business, acceptable marketplace, obviously, which is close to breakeven, we are pretty much in line.\nJoshua Raskin: Alright.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Well thank you for that. Joe, as it relates to the Medicare risk scoring, I guess, can you talk about the timing or your expectations as it relates to the ability to conduct the beneficiary valuations and maybe talk about what you have seen in the back half of 2020 and kind of the expectations as we roll through 2021 just as your ability to get in front of these people?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Sure, well, utilization did remain suppressed through the balance of 2020. It wasn't as suppressed late in the year. But look, our team is on this. We have a crackerjack Medicare team. They are all over this, and their instructions are very simple, have a credible estimate of how many interactions you can actually achieve, what is your reasonable estimate of proper risk scores attained. And to the extent it falls short of your long-term expectation, make sure you consider it in your bid. So either way, and obviously, with the goal of making sure your product remains competitive with benefit designs from competitors. So the team is all over it. And the good news is this year, we will have full visibility. Last year, it was [indiscernible] submitting your bids right as the pandemic was in full throttle. And we made the conscious decision not to introduce that into our bid. This year, we would think otherwise.\nGeorge Hill: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joe Zubretsky for any closing remarks.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Thank you, operator. When we started this transformational journey over three-years ago, the work ahead moved pretty large. We knew that if we form the right team, that we could succeed, so we sought to recruit Managed Care industry veterans, battle-hardened veterans, if you will, who would know exactly what to do. Tom Tran personifies that. We developed a durable financial infrastructure that has been instrumental in our early success and which will have lasting impact. The team we built is a high-performing one, and we are very confident in their continued success. Tom's tireless energy, steady hand and good nature will certainly be missed by us all. Tom, on behalf of all of our constituents, and from me personally, thank you for your immense contribution to our success, and we wish you the best of luck and good health in your retirement. Operator, with that, we will end our call today.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joseph Zubretsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Julie, and good morning. Today, we will provide updates on several topics. First, we will cover enterprise-wide financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2020; second, we will provide initial earnings and earnings per share guidance for 2021; and lastly, we will conclude with some thoughts on our compelling strategic position and our future growth prospects. Let me start with fourth quarter highlights. Last night, we reported GAAP earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of $0.56 with net income of $34 million and total revenue of $5.2 billion a revenue increase of 22% over the prior year. On a normalized basis, defined as adjusted earnings per share and excluding the net effect of COVID, our earnings per diluted share were $2.29 for the fourth quarter. This is consistent with our performance in the first three quarters of 2020, each of which produced approximately $3 per share, after adjusting for the effect of COVID. Two items significantly impacted the earnings in the fourth quarter. The first and most prominent of these items was the net effect of COVID which decreased net income in the quarter by $3.80 per share. The most significant contributor to this impact was the continuation of rate refunds already in flight and the introduction in the quarter of COVID-related retroactive rate actions in California, Michigan and Ohio. These refunds taken together more than offset the net effect of modest utilization curtailment and a high level of COVID direct cost of care. The second significant item having an impact in the quarter came from adjustments that produced a combined net benefit of $1.07 in earnings per share. The most significant of these was a net benefit from the proceeds of federal litigation which was partially offset by a charitable contribution to our foundation. In summary, we are pleased with our normalized fourth quarter performance with respect to both the continued delivery of solid earnings and the focused execution of our growth strategy. All of this was achieved whilst dealing with the effects of the global pandemic. Now turning to the full-year, we reported full-year 2020 GAAP earnings per diluted share of $11.23, with net income of $673 million and a 3.5% after-tax margin. We generated premium revenue of $18.3 billion, an increase of 13% over 2019 reflecting increased membership. We ended the year with four million managed care members, a 700,000 member increase year-over-year, primarily due to growth in Medicaid. Our Medicaid enrollment finished the year strong at 3.6 million members, representing growth of over 640,000 members or 22% over the prior year. This increase reflects strong organic growth of 450,000 members or 15% as the suspension of redeterminations was the major catalyst for our Medicaid membership growth in 2020. Growth of 370,000 members related to the acquisitions of YourCare, which closed on July 1st and Passport, which closed on September 1st. This organic and inorganic growth was offset by the 180,000 member decline related to our planned exit from Puerto Rico. I will now provide additional color on our full-year normalized financial performance which better expresses the underlying strength of our business by isolating the transitory effects of COVID and adjustments. On a normalized basis, our earnings per diluted share were $12.97 for the full-year. Our normalized performance comfortably exceeded our full-year guidance of $11.20 to $11.70 per share, which was established in the absence of COVID and is therefore the most relevant comparison. With respect to medical margins, for the full-year, our MCR on a normalized basis was 85.9% compared to 85.8% in the prior year. In Medicaid and Medicare, our performance met expectations, while in marketplace, our performance is below our expectations. Our normalized G&A ratio for the year was 7.3% compared to 7.7% in 2019 reflecting disciplined cost management and the benefits of scale produced by our substantial growth. We produced a normalized after-tax margin of 3.9% despite our marketplace business underperforming. We are very pleased that while dealing with the medical cost distortions and operational complexity caused by the pandemic, we produced a normalized margin, consistent with our long-term target. Now I will comment on the item-by-item effects of COVID on our full-year 2020 results. The net effect of COVID increased pre-tax income by approximately $180 million or $2.30 per share. This result is the sum of several identifiable positive and negative factors as follows: For the full-year, the net benefit from COVID-related utilization curtailment, offset by direct care related to COVID patients was approximately $420 million on a pre-tax basis. I should note that while utilization was moderately curtailed in both the fourth quarter and the full-year, in the fourth quarter direct COVID medical costs were higher than in any other quarter of the year. For the year, COVID related risk-sharing corridors reduced premium revenue and earnings by approximately $555 million on a pre-tax basis. $400 million of this amount was reported in the fourth quarter as the three new COVID-related risk-sharing corridors went active and corridors already existing at the end of the third quarter remained in effect. For the year, COVID-related activities increased our G&A spend by approximately $35 million on a pre-tax basis. Without question, the effects of COVID created significant distortions to our 2020 operating metrics, but the underlying operating fundamentals and financial metrics remain strong. Turning to our 2021 guidance beginning with premium revenue, we are very pleased with the rapid activation of our growth strategy. In 2021, we project premium revenue of at least $23 billion, a 25% increase over 2020. This growth is well balanced between a new contract win, organic growth both on acquisition benefit expansions in our existing geographies and greater penetration of our Medicare and Marketplace products into our Medicaid footprint. More specifically, our premium revenue guidance includes a full-year of the acquired Magellan Complete Care businesses, which we closed on December 31st. A full-year of Kentucky revenue, which commenced on September 1, 2020, a full-year of revenue from the YourCare membership in upstate New York, which we assumed on July 1, 2020. Marketplace revenue growth of 25% to 30% as we begin this year with more than 500,000 members. The full-year carve-in of the pharmacy benefit in the state of Washington, which is somewhat offset by a partial year of pharmacy carve-outs in New York and California, and the revenue decrease associated with our planned exit from Puerto Rico. The impact of the Affinity acquisition is not included in our premium revenue guidance. We expect the transaction to close as early as the second quarter, so the acquisition could provide $600 million or more in additional premium revenue in 2021. Our guidance includes membership growth relating to the current public off emergency extension set end in mid-April 2021, with a steady decline over the remainder of the year as redetermination is activated. The Biden administration has recently indicated that it is likely the public health emergency will remain in place for the entirety of the year. If so, states could continue to receive the additional 6.2% FMAP match throughout 2021, which would likewise extend the redetermination suspension requirement for the state. Although we have been adding more than 100,000 Medicaid members per quarter during the redetermination suspension in 2020, it is unclear whether this pattern would continue should PHE be extended further. Therefore, we have not included in our guidance an estimate of revenue associated with additional volumes from potential PAG extensions. However, any extension of the PAG accompanied by redetermination suspension could certainly represent upside to our 2021 revenue outlook. We estimate that for every month, the redetermination suspension is extended past April. It could provide additional revenue of approximately $150 million per month. Turning now to earnings guidance, given our recent and expected continued M&A activity, adjusted earnings per share have become a more relevant measure of our earnings going forward and would be the focus of our comments today. Our initial full-year 2021 adjusted earnings guidance is in the range of $12.50 to $13 per share or approximately 20% growth from 2020 adjusted earnings of $10.57 per share. The upper end of our 2021 guidance range is essentially equal to our 2020 normalized earnings per share of $12.97. Our 2021 earnings profile reflects durable and sustainable operating improvements and earnings growth which are being temporarily muted by a [ephemeral] (Ph) industry-wide challenges. Specifically, our 2021 earnings guidance reflects the following positive long-term value drivers: Continued strong performance in Medicaid and Medicare, reflecting an actuarially sound base rate environment. Margin recovery and growth in our Marketplace business which we target to achieve mid-single-digit pre-tax margins for 2021 as a result of our intense focus on operational improvements and continued competitive prices and product designs; and accretion from the Magellan Complete Care businesses into our Kentucky and Passport installation. Our earnings guidance also considers the following industry-wide environmental challenges, including another net negative impact from COVID, although at a reduced level, due to the continuation of many of the risk-sharing corridors that existed in 2020 and the direct cost of COVID-related patient care, offset by the moderate utilization curtailment. And lower-than-expected Medicare risk scores, which are an industry-wide challenge that would pressure results. Our risk scores do not fully reflect the acuity of our membership as in 2020 seniors reduced their access to health care services and therefore, risks or cash is more challenging. Referencing these catalysts and challenges, we now quantify the progression from our 2020 normalized earnings of $12.97 per share to the midpoint of our 2021 adjusted earnings guidance of $12.75 per share. We expect strong core performance to contribute approximately $1.25 in adjusted earnings per share growth, emerging mostly from Marketplace as Medicaid and Medicare margins are near optimal. And accretion from our acquisitions, along with share repurchases, will positively impact adjusted earnings by approximately $1 per share. Offsetting these positive factors are two industry-wide environmental challenges that temporarily pressure earnings, specifically, we expect the net effect of COVID consisting of utilization curtailment and direct cost of care, offset by risk-sharing corridors to continue to negatively impact earnings, but in 2021 by approximately $1.50 per share. And the temporary Medicare risk score shortfall phenomenon would pressure results by approximately $1 per share. All of these items, when combined with the initial performance of recent acquisitions operating below target margins, impact our 2021 MCR and by approximately 200 basis points when compared to 2020 normalized. This corresponds to a 90 basis point impact on the net income margin. Our 2021 guidance represents solid underlying earnings growth, but it is a constrained picture of the embedded earnings power of the company. The financial profile that we can develop when COVID and industry-related headwinds abate. And when our acquisitions achieve their full run rate potential will include: first, the net effect of COVID in the Medicare risk score disruption has created approximately $2.50 of adjusted earnings per share overhang. We would expect this overhang to disappear as COVID abates. Second, once we obtain our targeted margins on Magellan Complete Care and Kentucky and once Affinity is closed and synergized, we would expect to achieve additional adjusted earnings per share of at least $1.50. In short, our pro forma run rate after the natural relaxation of these temporary constraints, would produce an after-tax margin of approximately 4%, which is in line with our recent performance and produce adjusted earnings per share comfortably in the mid-teens. I will now provide a few concluding comments that frame the compelling strategic position we have created. The execution of our margin sustainability and revenue growth strategy has allowed us to create a very attractive financial profile. Despite all of the near-term distortions caused by COVID, the achievement of our 2021 guidance implies generating EBITDA of $1.2 billion with adjusted EBITDA margins in excess of 5%, producing a return on equity of nearly 40% and which is a function of our attractive margin position and disciplined deployment of growth capital; projecting contribution margin upside as we soon expect to achieve our target margins in our acquired businesses. Generating excess cash flow, which, when combined with leverage, gives us the continued ability to acquire businesses in our quarter; producing a two-year compound annual growth rate of 20%; and to summarize, that the durable earnings catalysts being sustained and as the temporary earnings challenges dissipate, our operating profile would produce mid-teens earnings per share. Despite the challenges and near-term distortions caused by the global pandemic, Our confidence in the growth, earnings power and resilience of our business remains high. The inherent growth characteristics of these businesses are exceptionally strong, and we will execute in harvest growth through winning new states, growing market share in our existing states, increasing penetration in high-acuity populations and actioning accretive acquisitions in our core business. We will continue to sustain best-in-class operating metrics and margins drive the top line growth and remain relentlessly focused on our value-creating mission. I will note that despite the vicissitudes of the economy and despite the pandemic, our management team and our associates have demonstrated tenacity, a determination and an ability to deliver. We are in the right businesses with the right people at the right time. Our future is very bright. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for some additional color on the financials. Tom. Sure, Matt. Our forecast for membership in the marketplace starting the year with 500,000 ending the year with just under four and a thousand and didn't contemplate the special enrollment period. We are certainly aware of it. We certainly have forecasted what it could provide. And for those 90-days, it couldn't provide anywhere from 20,000 to 30,000 additional members. We are forecasting that potentially it could provide an extra $100 million to $150 million of revenue for the year. Now in the context of our margin recovery process, it is unaffected by that. We are very comfortable with the pricing we put into the marketplace, we are very comfortable with our product designs and our benefit designs, our product positioning, and we are very comfortable in achieving our mid-single-digit pre-tax margins for the year, irrespective of any additional revenue attained to the special enrollment period. Well, it is very competitive. There is lots of new entrants, but we are very confident. And one of the reasons we are confident is the two areas of operational let down, if you will in 2020, utilization review and attainment risk scores. We have introduced operational excellence of those two operating fundamentals and our other two businesses. We are really good at it in Medicaid and really good at it in Medicare. And we were just behind and importing those skills that exist in our company to the marketplace platform. That has been corrected. And so we are very comfortable that by executing across those two fundamentals, we will get back to mid-single-digit margins. Sure. During our prepared remarks, we gave a sort of a qualitative bridge - quantitative bridge committed bridge and understanding the catalysts and pressures inside our 2021 guidance all with the goal of helping our investors understand what might be looked at as a jumping off point into 2022. So here are the puts and takes. First of all, the net effect of COVID of $1.50 per share or $110 million of pre-tax will dissipate overtime as utilization comes back to normal, as the risk quarters disappear that $1.50 overhead will evaporate as the pandemic is solved. In addition, the Medicare risk score phenomenon, last year was an interesting year. Seniors didn't access health care. And so interacting with them, getting the right codes to attain the right risk force us was a challenge, not just for us, but for many of our competitors. Next year, we will either - meaning this year, we will either attain the risk scores, because they will be getting services, or if we aren't satisfied that we can, we can include that in our bids. And last year, obviously, the bids were done far before the impact of COVID has ever known. So we are very comfortable that combined at $2.50 overhang sort of disappears as COVID gets behind us. As we said, in addition, our acquisitions are being integrated really, really well, and we are very comfortable with the $1 of accretion that we are putting in this year's guidance, but we are also comfortable in saying, that when they hit their full target margin and when Affinity is closed and hit its target margin, there is an additional $1.50 of earnings per share there. So all in, there is a good $4 of earnings per share embedded power sitting inside our 2021 guidance. We have created the bandwidth. We have an expert M&A team that finds the properties and knows how to action them and close them. We have built a world-class integration team. The Passport integration is going really well and the early read on the Magellan integration is going really, really well. That is why we are so comfortable in affirming the accretion targets that we have given you. We have actually very fortunately, laid out quite nicely on a timeline. By the time Magellan is fully integrated, we would just be closing on Affinity, perhaps by the second quarter. And so if we action one, two or who knows how many more this year and they close either late in the year, early next year, the timeline couldn't be more amenable to being very effective at integrating them and harvesting the accretion that we promised our investors. Thank you. I want to make sure I understand your question. You are talking about the puts and takes within our 2021 guidance or beyond. Sure. Well, bear in mind that the core performance here is irrespective of the net effect of COVID, which is tracked in a different place as the way we have articulated this. So the $1.25 is mostly the marketplace since that was the business that underperformed last year. It was just about breakeven in 2020, and we are targeting mid-single-digit pre-tax. And if you look at the potential for $1.9 billion, $2 billion of revenue, you can start to formulate a picture of how that is a significant contributor to the $1.25 core performance tailwind into this year. There are some puts and takes there, but with Medicare and Medicaid margins where they are, we are going to grow the top line and obtain the margin position there is. But there is not a lot of margin upside in Medicare and Medicaid. So we are very comfortable with the position that we presented here from a core business perspective. Medicare and Medicaid are pretty much optimized with respect to margins. The marketplace as a first step to getting back to where we said we would be. A mid-single-digit pre-tax margin would be our target for 2021. Yes, you are generally in the right area. If I were to break apart the dollar, I would say that $0.75 is Magellan, which is the top end of the range that we committed to for the first full-year of ownership, $0.10 on Kentucky. It would be very close to breakeven in the first full-year of ownership, and we will drive it to peak margins after that and about $0.15 on buyback. That is how you get to the dollar. Okay. Thank you. We have attempted to capture all COVID impacts in the COVID line item. And just to sort of reframe how we track that, our estimate of COVID impact, is the amount of medical cost suppression we believe we have observed offset by the direct cost of caring for COVID patients. And then, of course, both offset by the impact of any liabilities generated due to the retroactive rate refunds or corridors. That is how we capture it. And if it related to an acquisition is captured in the COVID line. In Kentucky, the open enrollment period was extended to March 15th. So there is still members moving around. We began the year with 320,000 members. The latest accounting has us about in that same zone. But on March 15th, the period will shutdown, and we will know how many members that we are beginning our new contract with. Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Sure. It is interesting because it is all about your assumption of how fast membership roles will attrite once the states turn redetermination back on. But I would tell you, in our numbers, the way the membership flows, both in 2020 and 2021, there is actually a member month increase in 2021, just based on the timing of both acquisitions and redetermination. So no, I would say that the redetermination process is with the 100% upside to our revenue and earnings picture in the year. We just felt it wasn't prudent nor did we have any credible way of estimating how many more members we would get if the redetermination pause was extended, and then how fast would they actually roll off depending on how states plan to implement the reintroduction of the determination. So I would just say that the redetermination issue or phenomenon is upside to both our revenue and earnings guidance for the year. Yes. The way we look at it on a Medicaid basis, we are beginning the year with 3.6 million members. On January 1st, 200,000 members come over due to MCC. And in the first quarter, based on our historical average of about 30,000 a month during redetermination suspension. We pull in another 100,000 members. It would hit its peak at 3.9, but then 600,000 would roll off in the balance of the year. Now that is a pretty quick roll off, and it might happen slower, which is another perhaps element of conservatism in our forecast. And yes, if you then process that against 2020 and the timing of how membership grew and the timing of our acquisitions, there is actually a 9% number month growth in 2021 on Medicaid. Thank you. Sure, sure, so let's provide the context for 2020. Our estimate of medical cost suppression for the entire year was about $620 million. That was offset by approximately $200 million of the direct cost of COVID care for COVID patients, netting to a $420 million surplus, we hesitate to call it a benefit, a surplus due to the impact on medical costs from the COVID pandemic. And this is not an estimate, it is an actual number, recorded $565 million of rate refunds, risk-sharing quarter of liabilities in the year and that combined with additional G&A of $35 million resulted in a net $180 million cost of COVID in our company for the year, which is $2.30 a share. Juxtaposed against that, to answer now your direct question, we are forecasting a more moderate, more modest level of suppression. And the reason is both the supply and demand side of the health care economy were shutdown last year for a while. Patients were afraid to go in for services. And if they wanted them, there were many executive orders and direct mandates not to provide elective and discretionary procedures. The supply side is open for business this year, but we still think there would be a demand side softening and will result in utilization suppression of somewhere around $200 million for the year, which is one-third of the amount of suppression we experienced in 2020. We will incur direct costs of COVID care. And the net of all that is somewhere between $140 million and $150 million. Most of this, we forecast will happen in the first half of the year. Hopefully, the vaccinations in the vaccine and social distancing will cause all this to really dissipate in the later half of the year. Now against that, we are also forecasting approximately $250 million of impact from retroactive or not retroactive, but risk-sharing quarters, I should say, which nets to about $110 million, which is your $1.50 a share. So the gross numbers are a lot less dramatic, but it is still netting to $1.50 a share. One of the reasons we are very comfortable of this estimate is really we focus on the net impact. Because if utilization is higher or lower than expected, there would be some flex up and down with the risk-sharing corridors. There is actually sort of a natural hedge between the suppression and the corridors themselves. So we look at the net number, we are very comfortable with that net number. And as the pandemic goes away, we think this goes back to normal times, and there would be no impact from COVID on a going-forward basis, obviously. So I hope that helps that tail with tape. I know that was pretty detailed, but that is what's included in our $1.50 estimate for the cost of COVID for 2021. Let me address the first part. The answer to the first part, the response is, yes, that is true. If you are already in a risk corridor and your medical costs go up or down, there is no net impact on the company. But that is the way to look at it, that because risk sharing corridors didn't address COVID suppression specifically, it just addressed through MLR, then if you are outperforming your MLR targets, you are getting back some money to the state. So the intention was to have a direct correlation between COVID suppression in a corridor, but the corridor is against medical costs generally. So the fact that we are very profitable in some states, the fact that we outperform many of the market participants in some states, the rate refund number is probably a little higher than people might have expected. But the answer to your second part of your question is correct. It will flex up and down in a state where we are already in a corridor and we are a state where there is not, we would either enjoy the benefits of additional surplus or the effects of additional higher medical costs. The only state that made - the biggest state that does not have a corridor in 2021 is California. Texas and Washington already have done and all of our other states continue them on into 2021. Sure, Scott. As we sit here in the second year of this global pandemic, we are not going to update our long-term margin guidance. We are just sort of going to go as you go, as you plow through this, start to form your views of what the landscape is looking like as you plow through it. I think that is the more prudent approach. But having said that, when you actually look at the pro forma impacts of many of these phenomenon that we consider quite temporary, you can pro forma this thing back to the high 3s or close to 4%. To the second part of your question, I actually hope that we always have a decrement sitting inside our margin for acquisitions that do not perform in their first year. That is a good decrement to have because if we can buy properties that are underperforming and with sweat equity, get them to perform, that is just another form of accretion. So the 40 basis points, this 40 basis points in our margin in 2021 in our guidance, that is literally related to the underperformance in the first year of our acquired properties both on the G&A line and on the MCR line. In the last part of your question was related to the risk corridors. Look, when they were introduced in 2020, they were clearly related to pandemic. They were presented that way, they were retroactive because they had to be because they were introduced mostly after the pandemic started. As they were reintroduced for 2021, they were presented as pandemic-related. The feeling was that there could be strange effects from the pandemic additional COVID costs, the cost of the vaccine, additional suppression, and that is why they were introduced on a symmetrical basis. You are protected on the downside and the state is protected on the upside. In CMS' approval guidelines, they have clearly stipulated that when they receive these for approval, they are viewing these as being attributed to the utilization impacts related to the pandemic. So it has been pretty clear to us that they were presented as relating to pandemic. CMS is approving them on the basis of relating to the pandemic. And we believe when the pandemic dissipates that these will disappear as well and will be back to the traditional rate-setting environment where rates are set prospectively using a credible medical cost baseline and a trend off that baseline. Well, thanks for that question. We are only three weeks into the new government and look what has been done. We all knew that the new government would be proponents of the social safety net of making sure the disadvantage have access to high-quality health care and plenty of subsidies so they can afford it. And look what has happened just in the first three weeks in terms of the executive order, at least the intention to extend the PHE to the end of the year. the executive order to introduce the special enrollment period on the marketplace. The executive order that the euphemism in the executive order was encouraging states to look at prior administration policies, which was really taking a shot at the public chargeable and Medicaid work requirements. So just what's come out of the White House in the past three weeks is incredibly bullish on government-sponsored health care, particularly for the disadvantaged. To your other point, things can get done through the reconciliation process and they are going to. The three committees in the house that generally write to health care issues are ways and means energy, e-commerce and oversight. And look at the language that they are introducing, increasing subsidies in the marketplace up to 150% of FPL. Making the product accessible to people over 400%, capping the cost at 8.5% of their income, and so on and so on and so on. Just in three weeks of a new government, both in the legislative bills that are coming out of the House and from Executive order in the White House just couldn't be better for government-sponsored Managed Care, and we are pleased to see that progress already being made. The answer to your last part of your question, Dave, is no, we haven't. But it still remains to be seen what it does to the acuity of the population. Now because we haven't introduced many more members in our forecast, so our guidance only includes 100,000 member growth in the first quarter of the year and then the attrition starts in the last three quarters of the year. But we certainly have not forecasted a continued softening of the acuity profile of our membership base. And in fact, if that in fact happens, and it happens in a quarter, say, it will go back against corridors anyway. So net-net, The impact of the extension of the redetermination suspension is a net positive, on any dimension, it is a net positive to our guidance. We did not include any members past the first quarter, we rolled them off pretty quickly. As I said in my prepared remarks, if you take 500,000 members, which is sort of what we got in redetermination for every month at $300 PMPM there is $150 million of additional revenue. What is the margin profile of that revenue, you can speculate that it is very, very good as the acuity population improves as you get more members. But we have not included any of that impact in our guidance for the year, either the membership flow or a acuity improvement that is sort of a positive jolt to our earnings and earnings per share. We would love to balance it out with more Medicare. They are hard to find. But we would love to balance out with more Medicare. We are growing it nicely organically, but we would love to find properties that have Medicare Advantage or D-SNP populations. I would say along the lines you have asked the question, we more look to the state. Is it a bolt-on within a state where we don't have so much market share that we couldn't get it done? Lighting up new states is really important. High acuity, really important, we are really good at high acuity. And there is a lot of players out there that have a lot of high-acuity lives and have little ability to manage them. So the upside on $1,500 of premium per month is huge, huge margin potential. So I would actually say that the geography is important, we love high acuity. And if they are underperforming but not broken, all the better because then we will take our operating team, open up the Molina playbook and drive accretion through margin expansion. No. I mean, since we did not put the - any impact, if there is a positive impact from redetermination in 2021, since it is not in our guidance, we did not - then, therefore, create a headwind in 2022. So just to be very clear, I appreciate the question, any impact from the extension beyond April of any additional membership or a slower attrition of membership is not in our revenue guidance. And any profit enjoyed by additional member months in 2021 is not in our guidance. So as I said, we are really comfortable to it, there is only upside to 2021 on the redetermination suspension. Sure, I understand your question. I'm sorry, I apologize I misunderstood your question. No, and again, we weren't giving a specific 2022 outlook. We are more trying to craft the bridge that we gave you as if we are guiding to $13 a share for 2021, sitting inside that is an earnings power that is higher than $13 due to some temporary phenomenon. But we weren't necessarily trying to extend into 2022 with an earnings or revenue bridge. Sorry, I misunderstood your initial question. But now that will come at a later date. Sure, unless the suspension goes on and members stay on through the end of 2021, depending on other acquisitions that we might do, then there is the Affinity piece that is coming in. So we are not doing a 2022 guidance bridge per se. But I understand your question, and it is a legitimate one. We are going to be guarded in giving a forecast of where the margins will land. The competitive landscape changes every day. We are very comfortable in getting this to mid-single-digit pre-tax this year. Now our hope, again, given the competitive landscape, that would lead to mid-single-digit after-tax in the future. That is where we think the business could perform. But let's work through the 2021. There is a lot of revenue to bring on, a lot of members to service. Some of them are new. We will have to get their risk scores. So one step at a time, I asked my team, let's get to the mid-single-digit pre-tax margin this year. And then as we prepare our bids for 2022, let's sort through how much margin we think we can get and how much membership we think we can get. But starting the year with 500,000 and a 25% to 30% revenue growth year-over-year was a nice start to get back in the game in this business. Okay. Thank you. Yes, Josh, truth be told in that dollar is a little bit from the physician fee schedule. So we just didn't think it was that big enough to call out. So there is a little bit of physician fee schedule in there. But you are in the right zone, 2.5% to 3%, our risk score revenue is multiples of that, two to three times that at least from what I recall. And the industry had a choice last year. We are in the middle of the pandemic, it just started in March and April. We are now starting to develop your bid. And for the most part, while we always tend to be conservative in our bids, we didn't put any specific load for, okay, we are going to fall short on risk scores. Obviously, with hindsight, that cost us three points on the revenue line. But next year, meaning this year, we will either have an estimate of what we think we can attain, and then based on what we target for benefit design and our margins, we would then allow for that in the bid we submit. So either way, whether we get the risk for or whether we price to it, we think this is a one-year phenomenon. That is the way we look at it. I think it is about a third. I will check that, but I think it is about a third. Where did we end? Well, again, depending on whether you look at a normalized basis or not, but, On adjusted earnings for 2020, we are at 3.3% net income margin, normalized 3.9%. And I would tell you that the individual margins for the lines of business were generally in line with our long-term targets. So 3.3% adjusted, 3.9% normalized, and the lines of business, acceptable marketplace, obviously, which is close to breakeven, we are pretty much in line. Sure, well, utilization did remain suppressed through the balance of 2020. It wasn't as suppressed late in the year. But look, our team is on this. We have a crackerjack Medicare team. They are all over this, and their instructions are very simple, have a credible estimate of how many interactions you can actually achieve, what is your reasonable estimate of proper risk scores attained. And to the extent it falls short of your long-term expectation, make sure you consider it in your bid. So either way, and obviously, with the goal of making sure your product remains competitive with benefit designs from competitors. So the team is all over it. And the good news is this year, we will have full visibility. Last year, it was [indiscernible] submitting your bids right as the pandemic was in full throttle. And we made the conscious decision not to introduce that into our bid. This year, we would think otherwise. Thank you, operator. When we started this transformational journey over three-years ago, the work ahead moved pretty large. We knew that if we form the right team, that we could succeed, so we sought to recruit Managed Care industry veterans, battle-hardened veterans, if you will, who would know exactly what to do. Tom Tran personifies that. We developed a durable financial infrastructure that has been instrumental in our early success and which will have lasting impact. The team we built is a high-performing one, and we are very confident in their continued success. Tom's tireless energy, steady hand and good nature will certainly be missed by us all. Tom, on behalf of all of our constituents, and from me personally, thank you for your immense contribution to our success, and we wish you the best of luck and good health in your retirement. Operator, with that, we will end our call today."

            "content": "Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to discuss our balance sheet, cash flow and 2021 outlook. Operating cash flow for the full-year 2020 was $1.9 billion, reflecting the strong operating result rose membership and the timing of government receipts and payments. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and our reserve position remains strong. Days in claim payable at the end of the quarter represents 50-days of medical cost expense compared to 52-days in the third quarter of 2020 and 50-days in the fourth quarter of 2019. Prior year's reserve development in the fourth quarter of 2020 was modestly favorable and was negligible in the comparable period in 2019. We extract $280 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter and $635 million year-to-date. The parent company cash balance at December 31, 2020, were $644 million, a decrease from the prior quarter cash balance of approximately $1.3 billion, due primarily to the cash outlay for the Magellan Complete Care acquisition. As of December 31, 2020, our health plans had total statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2 billion, which equates to approximately 330% of risk-based capital. Through December 31, 2020, we repurchased an aggregate of approximately 760,000 shares for $159 million. At an average price of approximately $208 per share. We continue to reduce our cost of capital. In November of 2020, we closed on a private offering of $650 million senior notes due November 2030 and used a portion of the proceeds to repay the $330 million senior notes. Debt at the end of the quarter is 2.1 time trailing 12-month EBITDA. Our leverage ratio is 53%. However, On a net debt basis, not a parent company cash, the leverage ratio is 45%. Taken together, these metrics reflect a reasonably conservative leverage position. Now turning to guidance, we introduced our initial full-year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $12.50 to $13. We expect premium revenue to exceed $23 billion a greater than 25% increase over 2020, and total revenue is expected to exceed $24 billion. We expect the medical care ratio to be approximately 88%. The MCR increase over 2020 is primarily due to the continuing net effect of COVID, temporary Medicare risk score disruption and higher MCR from recent acquisitions. We expect our adjusted G&A ratio to improve to approximately 7%. This reflects continued disciplined cost management, revenue growth, and fixed cost leverage. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 25.6%. And adjusted after-tax margin is expected to be approximately 3%, which is impacted by approximately 90 basis points related to the items I just mentioned, including the continuing net effect of COVID, Medicare risk scores and initial performance of recent acquisition operating below target margins. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Trudell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Molina Healthcare. Please go ahead.\nJulie Trudell: Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare\u2019s third quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina\u2019s President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Tom Tran. A press release announcing our third quarter earnings was distributed yesterday after the market closed and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made herein are as of today, Thursday, October 29, 2020, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we\u2019ll refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our third quarter 2020 earnings release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the current environment, recent acquisitions, 2020 guidance and our longer-term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K Annual Report for the 2019 year filed with the SEC as well as risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call and take your questions. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?\nJoe Zubretsky: Thank you, Julie, and good morning. Today, we would like to provide you with updates on a number of topics. First, we will cover the enterprise-wide financial results for the third quarter. Second, we will discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various aspects of our business. Third, we will convey our 2020 guidance in the context of our third quarter results. And fourth, we will provide an update related to the continued execution of our growth strategy. Let me start with the third quarter highlights. Last night, we reported GAAP earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of $3.10 with net income of $185 million. This result was supported by an MCR of 85.9%, a G&A ratio of 7.3%, and an after tax margin of 3.7%. Our year-to-date GAAP earnings per diluted share is now $10.65. On an adjusted basis, which excludes non-recurring non-operating items are earnings per diluted share were $3.36 for the third quarter. Excluded items related primarily to costs associated with our exit for Puerto Rico and startup costs associated with various growth initiatives. In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter performance, both with respect to the continued delivery of solid earnings and the focused execution of our growth strategy. All of this was achieved while dealing with the effects of a global pandemic. Unlike the second quarter, in which the combined COVID-related impacts serve to temporarily increase our earnings, in this third quarter, the combination of all COVID-related impacts net its way negligible to slightly positive impact on earnings. Therefore, our reported results and ex-COVID results are essentially the same. We will once again quantify the various COVID impacts on our results to provide some clarity on how they affected our operating metrics. But it is clear to us that our operating metrics were substantially in line with our expectations both as reported and as adjusted for COVID impacts. Now I will provide some highlights related to our third quarter results from an enterprise perspective. Beginning with revenue, our premium revenue of $4.8 billion increased by 17% over the prior year, and by nearly $400 million and 9% sequentially. Relatedly, our membership increased sequentially by 478,000 members or 13% primarily in Medicaid. Bear in mind, these increases include the membership and revenue of Passport, which we assumed on September 1 when the Commonwealth of Kentucky novated Passport\u2019s Medicaid contract to Molina. With respect to medical margin with an 85.9% MCR, our performance was also strong and only modestly impacted by COVID. We experienced a modest amount of utilization curtailment, which was partially offset by the cost of COVID-related care. The net of which favorably impacted the medical cost line. This was substantially offset by COVID-related rate refunds on the premium revenue line. In the quarter, these items combined had a negligible impact on the total company medical margin and earnings, but serve to decrease the medical care ratio by approximately 60 basis points. This strong medical margin performance anchored by Medicaid reflects a sound non-COVID rate environment, continued excellent management of medical costs and a moderately lower acuity population. All of the COVID-related impacts on our third quarter metrics will be described in more detail in a few moments. Next, we continued to effectively manage our administrative costs through productivity gains and fixed cost leverage reducing a G&A ratio of 7.3% despite spending on specific COVID-related items, including the cost of servicing the additional membership volume. Net investment income usually not in earnings item with significant variability was again unusually low at $14 million compared to $40 million a year ago, due to the current low interest rate environment. Our line of business results were mostly in line with our expectations with strong metrics in both Medicaid and Medicare. However, our marketplace results fell short of our expectations. In Medicaid and Medicare, control over medical cost utilization and unit cost continues to provide the ballast for a sustained consistent performance all while ensuring our members receive high quality care. COVID-related impacts were slightly favorable in the Medicaid and Medicare businesses. Excluding the COVID-related impacts our performance and resulting margins in these lines still exceeded our pre-COVID expectations. In our marketplace business, the COVID-related impacts in the quarter were net unfavorable. We also operationally underperformed in our bronze product with respect to both utilization control and the achievement of risk scores that accurately reflect the acuity level of that population. We remain confident in our ability to titrate the medical margin performance of this metallic tier. As we have done in our Medicare and our flagship Medicaid business. In summary, we continue to perform well across the many domains of managed care and our operating fundamentals remain very strong. Now I will provide some commentary about the item by item effects of COVID on our third quarter. While these items are of note, when individually considered, together they net way negligible to slightly positive impact on enterprise earnings and earnings per share in the quarter. The COVID impacts on our quarterly results include a modest net decrease in medical costs due primarily to COVID-related utilization curtailment. Rate refunds to a number of our state Medicaid customers and response to the COVID-related utilization curtailment, which we experienced in both the second and third quarters, in increase in our G&A spending on activities related to COVID and a meaningful increase to our Medicaid membership. We experienced several significant COVID-related impacts on medical costs in the quarter. First, at the beginning of the quarter, utilization was still moderately curtailed, but rebounded to more normal levels during the quarter. Second, we attracted approximately 300,000 new Medicaid members to Molina since the end of March. And the acuity of that population is clearly lower than the book of business average. And third, direct costs to care for COVID patients totaled $35 million in the quarter. As a resurgence of COVID infections and episodes has occurred in places including Texas and California and disproportionately impacted the marketplace business. In the quarter, the net effect of these three factors reduced normalize medical costs and increased pre-tax earnings by a range of $95 million to $105 million. As you recall, in the second quarter, six of our state customers enacted temporary rate refunds with the stated intent of recouping the portion of our capitated rates not spent on medical costs due to the pandemic. In some of those states, the refund period extended into the third quarter. In addition, during the quarter one additional state Michigan enacted a refund mechanism. In the third quarter, the total impact from COVID-related rate refunds serve to reduce premium revenue and earnings by $88 million on a pre-tax basis. With respect to rate adequacy, we do not intend nor do we want to keep state Medicaid money that was intended to be spent on medical benefits, but was not due to utilization curtailment caused by COVID. In many of our Medicaid states, there are already mechanisms in place to protect against a surplus margin as there are minimum MLRs in seven of our states and profit caps in two others. And once the COVID-19 pandemic abates, we believe that the traditional process of establishing prospective actuarially sound rates based on a credible medical cost baseline and cost trend off that baseline will resume. COVID-related activity increased our third quarter administrative expense by approximately $7 million. We continue to develop a variety of new operational protocols, technology implementations, and benefits for our employees all related to the COVID pandemic and the related increased volume. Medicaid membership increased sequentially by 473,000 in a quarter, a 15% increase. 325,000 of this increase was directly related to the Passport membership and Kentucky, which we assumed on September 1. The addition of the YourCare membership in New York was almost entirely offset by the expected membership decline from the early stages of our Puerto Rico exit. The remaining 148,000 member increase was primarily due to the suspension of redeterminations. As we believe that unemployment related enrollment has not yet materially accessed managed Medicaid. It remains unclear how high the COVID-related membership peak will be, how quickly it will fall as the economy recovers and where it will ultimately settle. However, it does appear that since unemployment nationally is now just under 8% initial industry estimates of unemployment related Medicaid membership increases were overstated. Relatedly, the declaration of the extension of the public health emergency period and the related maintenance of effort extension into next year will likely have a favorable impact. In summary, as we work through this unprecedented period of the COVID pandemic, we remain focused on executing on the underlying fundamentals of our business to continue to produce solid results, regardless of the short-term COVID-related impacts on our reported financial metrics and results. Now I turn to our guidance for the full year. In September 1, we closed on the Passport acquisition and the Commonwealth of Kentucky novated Passport\u2019s Medicaid contract to Molina. For 2020, the four months of revenue from this transaction will add approximately $700 million of revenue with negligible earnings. This increase combined with higher Medicaid enrollment through the third quarter, supports the increase in our 2020 total revenue guidance to $19.6 billion from the previous estimate of $18.8 billion. This total revenue guidance for 2020 includes $18.6 billion in premium revenue. Our core performance each quarter has been strong and stable producing at or about $3 of earnings per share. Although this core business performance is expected to remain strong through the fourth quarter, we are choosing to maintain our existing guidance. We take this cautious approach because of the continued uncertainty related to COVID impact on medical costs and the possibility for additional COVID-related rate refunds. We further note that the proceeds from the previously announced favorable settlement with respect to the federal risk corridor litigation will be reported in our fourth quarter. Also in the fourth quarter, we intend to make a sizable contribution to our recently launched MolinaCares charitable foundation. These two items will likely offset each other. When we report our fourth quarter, we will certainly focus on providing a clear view of the earnings power of the business as a baseline for gauging the quality of our 2021 earnings guidance. Shifting the discussion now to our growth initiatives, we made another major stride in the quarter related to the activation of our growth strategy. In September, we signed a definitive agreement to purchase Affinity Health Plan of New York for approximately $380 million. The profile of Affinity is perfectly aligned with our philosophy of staying close to our core business. It is a managed Medicaid business in New York City, as well as surrounding counties and is a nice compliment to the Senior Whole Health business that we are acquiring with the Magellan Complete Care acquisition. Affinity serves approximately 284,000 Medicaid members. Its membership base is stable and the company has very good share in the markets it serves. Affinity\u2019s operating infrastructure sound, it has solid provider relationships, a high performing team of enrollment coordinators and a platform, which has the ability to successfully defend and expand its market position. Affinity has not performed to the levels of profitability that Molina has achieved. It therefore provides yet another opportunity for us to bring our operating discipline, business processes and technologies to improve margins and harvest fixed cost leverage with our other New York-based businesses. The transaction is expected to close as early as the second quarter. So the acquisition could provide up to $600 million of revenue for 2021. At a purchase price of less than 30% of reporting revenue, we are projecting excellent returns in excess of our cost of capital. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive by $0.15 to $0.20 adjusted earnings per share in the first 12 months of our ownership. After that initial integration period, we expect to achieve margins consistent with both Molina\u2019s performance track record and the industry norm for the New York metro area. The purchase of Affinity is another milestone in a growth oriented 2020. Our growth initiatives continued to be anchored by our capital allocation priorities. First, organic growth of our core businesses, second, inorganic growth through accretive acquisitions, and third programmatically returning excess capital to shareholders. We previously provided you with a 2021 premium revenue outlook. This outlook included a pro forma estimate of the revenue associated with our announced acquisition of Magellan Complete Care, which is on track to close around the end of the year and an estimate of the revenue expected from auto assigned membership and our new Kentucky Medicaid contract. That outlook, which included only a modest early estimate of organic growth, was 2021 premium revenue of $21.5 billion. This 2021 outlook has improved now that we are currently serving all of Passport\u2019s existing membership in Kentucky, the majority of which we are expecting to keep. Our expectation is not affected by a court ruling last Friday that a sixth player should be added to the Kentucky Medicaid program for 2021. That ruling did not rescind our Medicaid contract award, does not impact the earlier novation of the Passport Medicaid contract to us and does not affect our status as a current incumbent in the program. Our 2021 outlook has also improved the announcement of the Affinity acquisition. We will provide refined revenue guidance with all the supporting details, when we announce our 2021 full year guidance. There was so much activity related to the political arena, legislative actions and judicial review that we feel obligated to provide some brief commentary on these topics. We have no new perspective to add on the upcoming election, except to say, that all of the most likely potential political outcomes are generally positive for managed Medicaid and related government subsidized programs, although, some political scenarios are more favorable than others. On the legislative front, the recently announced expansion of the COVID public health emergency is likely a positive indicator for continued membership gains and to provide more support for an actuarially sound rate environment. Much has been written and discussed regarding the Affordable Care Act case that is scheduled to be argued before the Supreme Court on November 10. We believe that even if the court were to find the individual mandate to be unconstitutional, it should nevertheless find the individual mandate to be separable from the balance of the law, both as a matter of logic and based on the clear intent of the 2017 Congress, which zeroed out the individual mandate tax penalty. It is also clear as a factual matter that the marketplace business can function effectively without any penalty for failure to purchase health insurance. Regardless of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, we believe there is a high likelihood of a legislative fix to the law before any final legal opinion would go into effect. As I conclude my remarks, I offer another heartfelt thank you to our management team and our 10,000 associates for delivering excellent results, while dealing with their own stresses and life challenges. Even when facing these challenges, our associates are inspired and motivated by the opportunity to make positive change by delivering high quality healthcare to the country\u2019s most vulnerable populations. Our associates continue to excel and I stand in admiration of their dedication and desire to serve our membership base, during these most challenging times. In conclusion, this was yet another meaningful quarter for the company. We are pleased with our third quarter performance, especially, in light of the turbulence caused by the COVID pandemic. We took major steps forward in our transformation. We sustained our margins and did right by our members and customers. We continue to execute on our revenue growth strategy and deployed excess capital in strategic acquisitions. This strong performance points to a very bright future. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for some additional color on the financials. Tom?\nTom Tran: Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. I am going to provide highlights of our financial results for the quarter and then discuss our balance sheet, cash flow, 2020 guidance and 2021 outlook. We reported GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.10 and adjusted earnings per share of $3.36, representing 13% and 19% growth respectively over the same period in 2019. The solid results were supported by premium revenue of $4.8 billion, which grew 17% from the third quarter of 2019 and include 22% year-over-year growth in Medicaid membership, inclusive of the Passport and YourCare acquisitions. As it relates to the COVID-19 impact by line of business, COVID reduce the Medicaid MCR by approximately 90 basis points and the Medicare MCR by approximately 130 basis points. However, COVID related impacts increase a marketplace MCR by approximately 310 basis points. Overall, the impact of COVID on third quarter earnings was negligible to slightly positive. The G&A ratio improves and came in at 7.3% compared to 7.6% in a prior year due to the fixed cost leverage we created from the increase in revenue, offset somewhat by increase in COVID specific costs and the integration of Passport. Now, turning to balance sheet and cash flow. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and our reserve position remained strong. Days in claim payable represent 52 days of medical cost expense compared to 52 days in the second quarter of 2020 and 50 days in the third quarter of 2019. Prior year reserve development for the third quarter of 2020 was negligible, as was the case with a comparable period in 2019. Operating cash flow for the nine months of 2020 was $591 million, reflecting the strong operating results and the timing of government receipts and payments. We extract $120 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, which brought our parent company cash balance to $1.3 billion and give us ample capacity to fund our recent acquisitions and organic growth initiatives. Debt at the end of the quarter is 1.6 times trailing 12-month EBITDA. Our leverage ratio is 48.2%. However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, the leverage ratio is 25.8%. Taken together, these metrics reflect a conservative leverage position. Our unsecured debt rating was recently upgrade by two notch to Ba3 by Moody\u2019s, a recognition of our operating performance, growth prospects and financial strength. As of September 30, 2020, our health plans has statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2.2 billion, which equates to approximately 365% of risk-based capital. Now turning to our 2020 guidance. We increase our full year 2020 total revenue guidance to approximately $19.6 billion from $18.8 billion, mainly due to the completion of the Passport acquisition in Kentucky and the novation of its Medicaid contract to Molina on September 1. As previously noted, we are maintaining our existing earnings guidance. Let me provide more color on the reasons for this cautious approach. First, while we have enclosed all known COVID related rate refunds in our guidance, additional rate refunds be enacted, such refunds would have a more disproportionate impact in the fourth quarter because of their retroactive nature. And second, there remains a level of uncertainty about COVID itself and/or related medical cost increase or decrease that could occur. If you recall, in the second quarter, we report approximately $190 million to $240 million of net COVID related medical cost decrease due to utilization curtailment. And in this third quarter, medical cost curtailment was $95 million to $105 million. We have been averaging $12 million to $13 million a month in COVID direct costs of care. How these many dynamics play out in a fourth quarter is a matter of significant uncertainty. As Joe mentioned previously, our core performance each quarter has been strong and stable producing at or above $3 of earnings per share. And our business performance is expect to remain strong through the fourth quarter. We will remind investor of the seasonality of the marketplace NCR and higher open enrollment expenses in both the Medicare and marketplace businesses in the fourth quarter. When we report our fourth quarter results, we will provide a clear picture of the run rate of the business, excluding the distortions cost by COVID, all with a goal of presenting a clear baseline off of which to gauge our 2021 guidance. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.\nMatthew Borsch: Hi. Thank you. I was just hoping maybe you could elaborate a little bit further on the pressure factors in the marketplace business. And I guess, I\u2019m a little surprised just because I was unaware of that 300 basis point increase in the MCR there maybe you can parse that out. That would be fantastic.\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure. Obviously in producing an 81% MCR for the quarter, we clearly underperformed. But 300 basis points of that was directly related to COVID. And it\u2019s all geography based. We have, as you know, a significant amount of membership in Texas, there was a COVID spike in Texas, and it\u2019s certainly impacted our marketplace business. But even with an ex-COVID MCR of 78%, we underperformed. We\u2019ve analyzed it thoroughly. It\u2019s related to the bronze product. Silver product is performing fine. And we think we\u2019re well priced and well positioned and product design and price. We underperformed on two very important operating levers and that is utilization control and the ability to attract and record appropriate risk scores commensurate with the acuity of that population. We have those disciplines in place for our other products and our other businesses through various organizational design issues. We have not yet excelled at those two operating disciplines in the marketplace business and we\u2019ll fix that the way we fixed everything else over the last couple of years.\nMatthew Borsch: And if I could just ask, given maybe where you\u2019re expecting the full year margin to land for the marketplace businesses. Is that above or below what you would view as sort of target sustainable?\nJoe Zubretsky: It will likely be below. As you know, a couple of years ago, the last time we gave you long-term targets is that our Investor Day, where we suggested that the long-term after tax margin for the marketplace business was 8.5% to 9.5%. We\u2019re certainly backing off that long-term target. This is a mid-single-digit business, but the likely to underperform after the year, but I think that\u2019s where our long-term margin expectation will lie mid-single-digits.\nMatthew Borsch: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. Maybe just to follow-up on that. So I guess, when we think about the business for 2021, you\u2019re saying \u2013 it sounds like you\u2019re saying that you\u2019re not worried about the pricing for this business in 2021, that even though costs are up, you\u2019ve priced appropriately, it\u2019s really just operational changes that need to be made for next year. And you should get that business back to normal next year.\nJoe Zubretsky: That is correct. In that bronze product, our bronze mix is slightly higher this year than last. And the bronze membership actually had a higher churn. And as you know, when you attract a new member, you\u2019re always starting with a risk score of one in new members. They haven\u2019t interacted with the healthcare system yet. So you need to work really hard at making sure, you get the right risk scores. So the fact that higher percentage that membership was new and our bronze mix is slightly higher. Product is adequately priced, product design and our zero-based \u2013 our zero premium products are in the right geographies. We\u2019re well positioned for next year. The companion question is, did you consider all this and the pricing that you filed recently? The answer is yes. We filed prices that included a very conservative pre-COVID medical cost baseline and reasonably conservative trends off that baseline. So our view, this is not a pricing issue. This is a performance issue, and we plan to get that back next year.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay, great. And then just to confirm some of the numbers that you mentioned on COVID, the $95 million to $105 million number. Was that a gross number? I think you saw $30 million of COVID costs. Is the $95 million to $105 million net about $30 million or should we think about that as a gross benefit [indiscernible] $30 million offset.\nJoe Zubretsky: No. You\u2019re correct. That\u2019s net. The gross range of costs curtailment due to the pandemic was $130 million to $140 million and direct costs related to COVID were $35 million, producing the net range of $95 million to $105 million.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay. But the $95 million to $105 million is on the same basis as the $190 million to $240 million you mentioned last quarter.\nJoe Zubretsky: That is correct. The estimates we gave in the second quarter were net of their direct inpatient medical costs related to COVID.\nKevin Fischbeck: All right. Perfect. Thank you.\nJoe Zubretsky: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead, Mr. Rhyee, your line is live. All right. Well, moving on the next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. First question on state to be margin corridors and state rebasing. Joe, can you \u2013 I think you said, margin corridors first little over $80 million this quarter, in terms of payback numbers. Do you have an estimate for the full year on both margin corridors and rebasing? And how you\u2019re thinking about that going into next year?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure. Well, just to recap the entire year, $75 million when we reported the second quarter due to six enacted retroactive rate refunds all clearly contained and related to COVID curtailment. That same number for the third quarter with $88 million, meaning we\u2019ve incurred $163 million year-to-date. The third quarter number included one additional state, Michigan that introduced a refund mechanism. And many of those corridors and refund mechanisms extended to the fourth quarter. We haven\u2019t disclosed exactly what that number is and obviously depends on a lot of other profitability factors, but various of those mechanisms do extend into the fourth quarter and we\u2019ll report that number against the COVID curtailment, just the way we did in the second and the third quarters. Long-term, we are very comfortable at the time tested mechanism of prospective rate development off a credible cost baseline and a reasonable trend off that baseline will resume. These refund mechanisms are clearly related to the recruitment of money that was paid to us with the full intention of us, paying it out to members and benefits and due to COVID that level of utilization didn\u2019t occur. So again, very contained, very specific, all related to COVID, when all that the pandemic abates, we believe that the system will function as intended and as time tested process of prospective rate development will resume.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. And then Joe, when you think about these members, who have the growth in membership, that\u2019s come from the lack of churn in this [indiscernible] I don\u2019t think any of us know, when the federal government is take off the federal emergency status and these members will start being reverified. But I\u2019m curious, as you think into 2021, whenever that does happen. Do you have a view on how these members kind of move off Medicaid, how long it takes for the state steady verify?\nJoe Zubretsky: It\u2019s a really interesting question, because we have begun conversations with many of our state customers about the prospects of moving members, who are no longer eligible for Medicaid, but we\u2019re on it due to the redetermination paws, how they will move them off. Obviously, and not for revenue reasons, we\u2019re not suggesting that they do it in a stage process for revenue generating reasons. But for the lack of tumult and lack of churn and the disruption, it will create for members who are on Medicaid and are suddenly taken off. So we\u2019re certainly arguing and in support of a more staged approach, but our state customers are still deliberating in terms of whether they\u2019re going to turn the switch off immediately or whether they\u2019re going to face this over time, which again, causes yet another variable. And what the redetermined \u2013 member redetermined patient-based revenue will look like for 2021. How fast those members roll off is still yet to be determined.\nJustin Lake: Great. Thank you, Joe.\nJoe Zubretsky: You\u2019re welcome, Justin.\nOperator: Thank you. And next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies.\nDave Styblo: Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Dave Styblo in for Windley. I was hoping you could talk Joe a little bit more about how you think about the both margin profile for Kentucky in year one. Usually, margins on a new contract are well below the target or even negative earnings in that first period. However, does it considerably help you that you\u2019ll have an existing platform via the Passport acquisition that might allow you to earn something closer to your target margins for all of your Kentucky business in the first year?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure. Well, when it comes to our acquisitions, we certainly and the extensive due diligence that we perform. We certainly able to give our investors a clear view of the early accretion, as we\u2019ve done on Magellan and as we just did on Affinity. When it came to Passport, it was a different model. We actually were buying into a membership base, a revenue stream, not necessarily an earnings stream. So we view Kentucky as sort of a hybrid between a new installation and the integration of a business. Now, as you know, the Passport earnings margin profile was not where Molina has operated in the past. So it\u2019s going to take some time to get it there. So we\u2019re going to be very cautious with our early estimate of how much \u2013 how many dollars of earnings will flow off the Kentucky Medicaid business in the first year. And when we report our 2021 guidance, we\u2019ll certainly have a reasonable estimate at that time. But right now, we are in full mode of analyzing Passport and integrating it due to the contract novation we have getting ready for open enrollment. All those processes are fully in motion. But it\u2019s too early to actually have a point estimate on the first year. But I will say that the Passport acquisition clearly allowed us to avoid a lot of the very expensive startup costs that are normally associated with a new contract.\nDave Styblo: Got it. Thanks. And then just a follow-up on the parent cash. Can you give us some sense of a roll forward over the next year. So obviously, you\u2019ve got a couple of acquisitions that you have to pay for, but how we should think about that cash balance towards the end of next year. So we can gauge a little bit more about your propensity to an appetite for acquisitions of these assets that you\u2019d like to have a bolt-on such as Affinity.\nJoe Zubretsky: The way to think about the capital model goes something like this. You can look at our forecasted earnings and except for the amount of capital that one would need to reserve and it\u2019s regulated subsidiaries to fund organic growth, which averages between 8% and 10% of premium. That cash flow ought to be able to be extracted in the form of dividends from our operating subsidiaries. Once it\u2019s brought to the parent company, you can put leverage on it and pick a leverage ratio of 50%, you can double your capacity. So earnings less retained capital for organic growth ought to be dividend to the parent doubled the size of it for debt capacity. And that gives your sort of view of how much free cash flow you have available for acquisitions and other activities.\nDave Styblo: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. First question is just around utilization patterns. And if you feel like towards the end of the quarter, you were back to whatever normal is supposed to look like our baseline, and maybe a progression to the quarter as well as an early view on October.\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, Josh. At the beginning of the quarter, we still had the curtailment effect in place and that sort of evaporated as the quarter moved on. Now, I will tell you that toward the end of the quarter, when the infection rate in many of our geographies and across the nation spikes, we saw a reaction to that. We\u2019re learning a lot about consumer behavior and about how the healthcare economy works and how reactive it is. It\u2019s very reactive to the COVID infection rate, both in the number of hospitalizations we have directly related to COVID and how quickly elective and discretionary procedures begin to wane when the COVID infection rate is reported. So the healthcare economy is very responsive to that infection rate. And towards the end of the quarter, we saw it spike back a little bit. Not commenting on October at this point, but as I said, it\u2019s very, very responsive. And the fact that we\u2019re now seeing a resurgence of COVID, I believe, will impact the fourth quarter. You\u2019ll see more COVID related costs, and I believe you\u2019ll see the shadow effect of continued curtailment.\nJosh Raskin: Perfect. And then just second question, as you think about 2021, you guys gave some visibility into a revenue number last quarter. It sounds like, you\u2019re updating it to be just simply larger. Is there any major difference expected between the top line and bottom line? I just want to make sure I\u2019m not missing something. It sounds like Passport kind of maybe a little bit lower than typical earnings. But just want to make sure there\u2019s no \u2013 there\u2019s nothing brought, I\u2019m missing that large acquired books aren\u2019t going to be similar margins, when you think about the synergies, et cetera.\nJoe Zubretsky: Well, ultimately, the premise of your question is correct. We plan to get these to our target margins, producing 6%, 6.5% EBITDA margins depending on the geography, we plan to get them there. We gave the accretion numbers for Magellan. We just gave them, at least the first 12 months for Affinity. And I would say, you\u2019re right, on Kentucky, given that it\u2019s a hybrid between an installation and the integration of a non-for-profit plan. I would not giving you a forecast, but I would say that in the first year, that is likely not to perform to our target margin.\nJosh Raskin: All right. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Sarah James of Piper Sandler.\nSarah James: Hi, thank you. I appreciate the commentary on the payback situation in multiple States in Medicaid. And I\u2019m wondering if that also indicates that Medicaid margins are operating near peak. Then if you layer on the lower long-term tax margin guidance, I\u2019m wondering if the right number for the total co is still the 3.8% to 4.2%, that you gave it last I-Day. Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Let me comment on our margin performance, vis-\u00e0-vis the long-term targets and you\u2019re absolutely right. The last time we updated this, which is now some time ago. We gave you a long-term target of 3.8% to 4.2% and we just produced a quarterly margin of 3.7%, which had somebody you have recognized falls just slightly out of that range. I will remind you that 3.8% to 4.2% included a marketplace target of 8.5% to 9.5%, which were clearly going to come off of that\u2019s going to land in mid-single-digits, not picking a point estimate now. So the fact that we\u2019re actually able to produce 3.7% after tax, when the marketplace this quarter was breakeven. I think we\u2019re still in the strike zone of our long-term targets, even though, we can pullback our projection of what the marketplace business will produce. And the fact that we\u2019re not the chatter two years ago, and it was legitimate was that our financial profile was over-relying \u2013 over reliance on marketplace revenues and profits. That\u2019s certainly not the case anymore, but if we can produce, our long-term part of margins having pulled back our marketplace estimates, I think that\u2019s certainly bodes well for the future.\nSarah James: And then on the bronze hicks, but last quarter you guys talked about COVID creating some challenges or delays in getting the adjusted risk scores. I\u2019m just wondering if you learned anything from this year\u2019s process that makes you more optimistic about the new members that come on next year and the pace at which you might get them scored.\nJoe Zubretsky: Yes, I mean the entire industry is facing the same challenges. As you know in order to get the right codes and the right interventions, people need to go to the doctor. And when they stopped going to the doctor and the hospital, you don\u2019t have the data to support their risks. Some of these require face-to-face interventions. We have a fantastic arm of our business with nurse practitioners and visit patients in their home. They were unable to do that for a long period of time. So we\u2019re sort of facing the same headwind that the rest of the industry is facing with respect to the attainment of risk scores. But as the economy opens up as people get back into the field, again we think this will come back quickly. We know how to get them. We know how to chase the charts, get the codes. And when the world returns to normal movements in consumer activity, we believe this thing snaps back into place. As you know the marketplace business reacts quickly to risk adjustment to immediate Medicare like one year delayed and Medicaid two years delayed. So there\u2019s a lag effect. But we believe as the world comes back to normal, we\u2019ll be able to get our metrics back to where they need to be as well the rest of the industry.\nSarah James: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. First question, just interested in Joe, I know you talked about how you\u2019re comfortable with the pricing for 2021 and with your exchange products as it relates to the bronze. Just interested in how you\u2019re looking at the overall market pricing environment for the marketplace for next year and how competitive you see that and how that positions you for growth in that market next year given some of the pricing that you\u2019re taking on your own book of business\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure. There are some new entrants that have entered some of our states, but you know who the big competitors are. We operate at a much different level than many of our competitors that we are going after the highly subsidized members who perhaps just earn a little more money than that would qualify them for Medicaid and we\u2019re leveraging our Medicaid network. So we\u2019re in a slice of the market that\u2019s heavily dependent on the federal subsidy. We think we can grow the pool of profits, trust management to pick the right geographies, push price and ease up on membership or to ease on price to push membership. We\u2019ll make those judgments geography by geography, depending on the strength of the competition, the strength of our network. And we believe as we always have that we can grow the pool of profits. Obviously we\u2019ll be growing it off of a smaller base, even our performance this year, but we\u2019re still pretty confident we can do that.\nScott Fidel: Got it. And then just on my follow-up question, why don\u2019t you just ask maybe a little conceptually about how you\u2019re thinking about the New York market and confidence in the rate in regulatory environment when we think of that longer-term, clearly you\u2019ve been deploying a meaningful amount of capital into New York. And from a bottoms up perspective, these are all deals that very much are attractive and fit the Molina profile. At the same time, obviously New York does have some larger long-term budget gaps relative to a lot of other states that are rejected. So just obviously I know that you think about the top down as well so interested in how you\u2019re evaluating just the broader market dynamics.\nJoe Zubretsky: Well, fair point. And obviously, you\u2019re always balancing those dynamics against where the population is. And if you want to be in the Medicaid business, you can\u2019t ignore places like California and New York where the Medicaid population live. So clearly a New York Metro is a place we want it to be. We have a nice blend of business there now. We have a traditional Medicaid business with the purchase of affinity, and we have a managed long-term care business with the purchase of senior whole health in New York. And you\u2019re right. New York is clearly has budget pressures and lots of other factors that are indigenous to New York. But in buying these properties and projecting the earning stream off of which they\u2019re valued, we certainly took all of that into consideration. So when you\u2019re an incumbent, those things happen, you might have some issues, but when you\u2019re contemplating all those puts and takes, when you\u2019re valuing a property in order to buy it, we\u2019re pretty comfortable that we pay for them correctly. We considered all the puts and takes that could happen in both New York Metro and the State of New York. And we\u2019re very comfortable that these are going to create long-term value with the accretion numbers we\u2019ve given.\nScott Fidel: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.\nGeorge Hill: Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I guess, Joe, circling back to the Texas exchange and Medicaid issues. Are you able to call out what types of utilization that you guys saw that drove the MLR up? And I guess what I\u2019m looking for are kind of any consistencies or correlation that, that might \u2013 I guess that might kind of rear its head in the future or kind of maybe even more color on what makes you think that this is kind of a contained issue that\u2019s readily fixable.\nJoe Zubretsky: Sorry, George, I couldn\u2019t hear the first part of your question. Which business were you referring to?\nGeorge Hill: The broad business, the exchange business.\nJoe Zubretsky: And we try to be very clear and transparent if we have an operating issue that didn\u2019t meet our expectations, but I think we need to put a box around this. Our entire marketplace business is 8% of our total revenue and to bronze business is about a quarter of the total marketplace business. It did underperform, but this is boxed, it\u2019s contained, it\u2019s identified, it\u2019s clearly related to operational performance. And we fixed so many operating protocols, introduced so many different performance improvement initiatives over the past couple of years. We\u2019re going to fix this. Again, when you look at where it is and how much of the company\u2019s profile, it actually consumes, it is a very contained, easy to fix issue. So I don\u2019t want to have this painted with a broad brush, because it\u2019s very specific and very contained.\nGeorge Hill: Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up to the question that Justin asked earlier. I don\u2019t know if you guys quantify this, but have you talked about what percent of the membership in Medicaid that you think is at risk of falling off when redeterminations resume?\nJoe Zubretsky: No, we haven\u2019t. We continue to see the redetermination pause. Last quarter, we broke protocol by giving an inner quarter update. I\u2019ll do the same now. We saw more membership increase in October. I think the number of increase is slightly over 30,000 in the month of October so far. Now that will be offset by our Puerto Rico exit. But in terms of new members coming on through redetermination, it continues into the quarter. But no, as we said in our prepared remarks, how high does the people be, how far \u2013 how quickly it will fall off as the economy approves. And to the point someone made earlier, how will the states actually unwind this in a staged approach or in a sudden approach is still yet to be determined. So no, we have not given any impact of this on our revenue forecast either for the balance for 2021. It certainly increased our revenue outlook for the rest of the year.\nGeorge Hill: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Stephen Tanal with SVB Leerink.\nStephen Tanal: Good morning, guys. Thanks for so much detail today. I guess I\u2019ll just do quick ones that, I don\u2019t know if I missed this, but I don\u2019t think you commented on the risk corridor settlement funding. I think you expected to get about $128 million. Is that still accurate and any plans for that money?\nJoe Zubretsky: Yes, that is accurate. We received it, $128 million pre-tax. It will be reported in the fourth quarter. And we are likely to have an offsetting amount in the quarter where we will be making a sizable contribution to our new 501(c)(3) charitable trust called the MolinaCares cord foundation. So likely a wash in the quarter when we report the fourth quarter, but yes, $128 million was the pre-tax number. And much of that will be deposited or contributed, I should say to our 501(c)(3) trust.\nStephen Tanal: Great, helpful. Thanks, Joe. And then maybe one last one for me, the Ohio rebid just wanted to get your major sort of confidence there and the likelihood of success. Is there an ability to take share? Any commentary there would be helpful.\nJoe Zubretsky: Well, we have \u2013 we run a fine business in Ohio with 12%, 15% market share. We\u2019re well-positioned across the entire state. And obviously we have our A team on this to key state for us. And we\u2019re very confident that we\u2019ll submit a high quality proposal. That\u2019ll be scored well. But it\u2019s a re-procurement and we\u2019ll submit it on November 20 when it\u2019s due. And when the announcement comes out, we\u2019ll certainly report that, but we have our ATM on this. We run a great business there. And we have every reason to believe we\u2019ll be successful. And not only retaining, but perhaps even expanding.\nStephen Tanal: Got it. There\u2019s an opportunity. Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Thanks for all the detail and the transparency. Most of my questions were answered. So I\u2019ll just ask a couple of little farther down the list. Just going back to Kentucky Passport, what are the applications though of adding the six player? Will there just be auto assignments and we just take a sixth off your expected membership or is it unclear how the allocations will be made at this point?\nJoe Zubretsky: It\u2019s unclear. And we don\u2019t want to get ahead of our customer on this one, because they have the jurisdiction over how to allocate in a portion membership. But yes, that\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about it. We are an incumbent. We\u2019re servicing 320,000 members today as we sit here today through the Passport brand, out of the Molina Healthcare, Kentucky legal entity. And when you introduce a six player, if in fact that\u2019s what\u2019s done, we believe the state will have to go through some process of reapportioning members. How that\u2019s done through auto assignment through or judgment. We just don\u2019t know, and we don\u2019t want to speculate, but that is the practical implication of that ruling that was made last Friday introduction of the six player, which will have to be a portion membership.\nGary Taylor: Okay. My one other is just thinking about when you looked at the COVID impact on your exchange business and you geographically called out Texas, if we look at the positive net benefit of COVID and care deferrals on your Medicaid MLR, would you similarly call out California as a geography that disproportionately benefit? Or is there anything else to say about the geography on the Medicaid MLR?\nJoe Zubretsky: The reason that it\u2019s less pronounced on the Medicaid MLRs, it\u2019s a more diversified book of business in 15 states. So no, I mean there\u2019s California was certainly a pressure point in all of our businesses with COVID as was Texas. But it\u2019s just less pronounced in Medicaid just because of the geographic diversification that we have.\nGary Taylor: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is another time from Charles Rhyee with Cowen.\nCharles Rhyee: Hi, can you guys hear me? Hello.\nJoe Zubretsky: Yes, perfectly.\nCharles Rhyee: Okay. Yes, sorry about that earlier. Similarly I think I got through most of my questions here. I just wanted to follow-up maybe Joe, when you were talking about the 2021 outlook here, obviously some of your peers have been speaking a little bit more cautiously. I think you\u2019ve obviously given some very solid targets and a positive outlook here. Any other additional comments you could add maybe in terms of what other areas and maybe conservatism that you\u2019re thinking about building in as you\u2019re approaching guidance maybe relative to prior years given sort of \u2013 given the heightened higher uncertainties that we\u2019re in here any other puts or takes that we should take into account, obviously take into account all the other comments you made earlier. Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: No, I think the actually the word you use to ask the question are actually reflective of the situation. There\u2019s clearly more uncertainty and risks to consider. As you move from this very intentive COVID pandemic into what may be a less intentive COVID pandemic environment. But all the puts and takes on managing a managed Medicaid business are certainly in play. It\u2019s \u2013what is the medical cost baseline look like for next year? How it will be influenced by COVID either increased or decreased by direct COVID or COVID curtailment. And then how that cost baseline is reflected in rates. We have good visibility into our rates at this early stage. We are for 2021 revenue base, we know about \u2013 we know the rates and about 40% of the revenue base at this point. When we give guidance in February, we\u2019ll understand the rates and about 70% of our revenues. So we\u2019ll have good visibility into that. And the conversations we\u2019re having with our state customers are very balanced. They\u2019re actuarially sound. They\u2019re based on reasonable cost baselines. But to me, the big issues that you always consider going into a year when you\u2019re trying to forecast earnings is medical cost projection, and how rates will be reflective of that medical cost baseline. And those certainly are the two issues that have to be considered as you look forward to next year. Not to mention the accretion that we\u2019re going to produce from the recent acquisitions that we\u2019ve integrated.\nCharles Rhyee: Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. And as there are no further questions, that does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session, as well as a conference call. Thank you so much for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Tom Tran",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. I am going to provide highlights of our financial results for the quarter and then discuss our balance sheet, cash flow, 2020 guidance and 2021 outlook. We reported GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.10 and adjusted earnings per share of $3.36, representing 13% and 19% growth respectively over the same period in 2019. The solid results were supported by premium revenue of $4.8 billion, which grew 17% from the third quarter of 2019 and include 22% year-over-year growth in Medicaid membership, inclusive of the Passport and YourCare acquisitions. As it relates to the COVID-19 impact by line of business, COVID reduce the Medicaid MCR by approximately 90 basis points and the Medicare MCR by approximately 130 basis points. However, COVID related impacts increase a marketplace MCR by approximately 310 basis points. Overall, the impact of COVID on third quarter earnings was negligible to slightly positive. The G&A ratio improves and came in at 7.3% compared to 7.6% in a prior year due to the fixed cost leverage we created from the increase in revenue, offset somewhat by increase in COVID specific costs and the integration of Passport. Now, turning to balance sheet and cash flow. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and our reserve position remained strong. Days in claim payable represent 52 days of medical cost expense compared to 52 days in the second quarter of 2020 and 50 days in the third quarter of 2019. Prior year reserve development for the third quarter of 2020 was negligible, as was the case with a comparable period in 2019. Operating cash flow for the nine months of 2020 was $591 million, reflecting the strong operating results and the timing of government receipts and payments. We extract $120 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, which brought our parent company cash balance to $1.3 billion and give us ample capacity to fund our recent acquisitions and organic growth initiatives. Debt at the end of the quarter is 1.6 times trailing 12-month EBITDA. Our leverage ratio is 48.2%. However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, the leverage ratio is 25.8%. Taken together, these metrics reflect a conservative leverage position. Our unsecured debt rating was recently upgrade by two notch to Ba3 by Moody's, a recognition of our operating performance, growth prospects and financial strength. As of September 30, 2020, our health plans has statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2.2 billion, which equates to approximately 365% of risk-based capital. Now turning to our 2020 guidance. We increase our full year 2020 total revenue guidance to approximately $19.6 billion from $18.8 billion, mainly due to the completion of the Passport acquisition in Kentucky and the novation of its Medicaid contract to Molina on September 1. As previously noted, we are maintaining our existing earnings guidance. Let me provide more color on the reasons for this cautious approach. First, while we have enclosed all known COVID related rate refunds in our guidance, additional rate refunds be enacted, such refunds would have a more disproportionate impact in the fourth quarter because of their retroactive nature. And second, there remains a level of uncertainty about COVID itself and/or related medical cost increase or decrease that could occur. If you recall, in the second quarter, we report approximately $190 million to $240 million of net COVID related medical cost decrease due to utilization curtailment. And in this third quarter, medical cost curtailment was $95 million to $105 million. We have been averaging $12 million to $13 million a month in COVID direct costs of care. How these many dynamics play out in a fourth quarter is a matter of significant uncertainty. As Joe mentioned previously, our core performance each quarter has been strong and stable producing at or above $3 of earnings per share. And our business performance is expect to remain strong through the fourth quarter. We will remind investor of the seasonality of the marketplace NCR and higher open enrollment expenses in both the Medicare and marketplace businesses in the fourth quarter. When we report our fourth quarter results, we will provide a clear picture of the run rate of the business, excluding the distortions cost by COVID, all with a goal of presenting a clear baseline off of which to gauge our 2021 guidance. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions."

            "name": "Joe Zubretsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Julie, and good morning. Today, we would like to provide you with updates on a number of topics. First, we will cover the enterprise-wide financial results for the third quarter. Second, we will discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various aspects of our business. Third, we will convey our 2020 guidance in the context of our third quarter results. And fourth, we will provide an update related to the continued execution of our growth strategy. Let me start with the third quarter highlights. Last night, we reported GAAP earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of $3.10 with net income of $185 million. This result was supported by an MCR of 85.9%, a G&A ratio of 7.3%, and an after tax margin of 3.7%. Our year-to-date GAAP earnings per diluted share is now $10.65. On an adjusted basis, which excludes non-recurring non-operating items are earnings per diluted share were $3.36 for the third quarter. Excluded items related primarily to costs associated with our exit for Puerto Rico and startup costs associated with various growth initiatives. In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter performance, both with respect to the continued delivery of solid earnings and the focused execution of our growth strategy. All of this was achieved while dealing with the effects of a global pandemic. Unlike the second quarter, in which the combined COVID-related impacts serve to temporarily increase our earnings, in this third quarter, the combination of all COVID-related impacts net its way negligible to slightly positive impact on earnings. Therefore, our reported results and ex-COVID results are essentially the same. We will once again quantify the various COVID impacts on our results to provide some clarity on how they affected our operating metrics. But it is clear to us that our operating metrics were substantially in line with our expectations both as reported and as adjusted for COVID impacts. Now I will provide some highlights related to our third quarter results from an enterprise perspective. Beginning with revenue, our premium revenue of $4.8 billion increased by 17% over the prior year, and by nearly $400 million and 9% sequentially. Relatedly, our membership increased sequentially by 478,000 members or 13% primarily in Medicaid. Bear in mind, these increases include the membership and revenue of Passport, which we assumed on September 1 when the Commonwealth of Kentucky novated Passport's Medicaid contract to Molina. With respect to medical margin with an 85.9% MCR, our performance was also strong and only modestly impacted by COVID. We experienced a modest amount of utilization curtailment, which was partially offset by the cost of COVID-related care. The net of which favorably impacted the medical cost line. This was substantially offset by COVID-related rate refunds on the premium revenue line. In the quarter, these items combined had a negligible impact on the total company medical margin and earnings, but serve to decrease the medical care ratio by approximately 60 basis points. This strong medical margin performance anchored by Medicaid reflects a sound non-COVID rate environment, continued excellent management of medical costs and a moderately lower acuity population. All of the COVID-related impacts on our third quarter metrics will be described in more detail in a few moments. Next, we continued to effectively manage our administrative costs through productivity gains and fixed cost leverage reducing a G&A ratio of 7.3% despite spending on specific COVID-related items, including the cost of servicing the additional membership volume. Net investment income usually not in earnings item with significant variability was again unusually low at $14 million compared to $40 million a year ago, due to the current low interest rate environment. Our line of business results were mostly in line with our expectations with strong metrics in both Medicaid and Medicare. However, our marketplace results fell short of our expectations. In Medicaid and Medicare, control over medical cost utilization and unit cost continues to provide the ballast for a sustained consistent performance all while ensuring our members receive high quality care. COVID-related impacts were slightly favorable in the Medicaid and Medicare businesses. Excluding the COVID-related impacts our performance and resulting margins in these lines still exceeded our pre-COVID expectations. In our marketplace business, the COVID-related impacts in the quarter were net unfavorable. We also operationally underperformed in our bronze product with respect to both utilization control and the achievement of risk scores that accurately reflect the acuity level of that population. We remain confident in our ability to titrate the medical margin performance of this metallic tier. As we have done in our Medicare and our flagship Medicaid business. In summary, we continue to perform well across the many domains of managed care and our operating fundamentals remain very strong. Now I will provide some commentary about the item by item effects of COVID on our third quarter. While these items are of note, when individually considered, together they net way negligible to slightly positive impact on enterprise earnings and earnings per share in the quarter. The COVID impacts on our quarterly results include a modest net decrease in medical costs due primarily to COVID-related utilization curtailment. Rate refunds to a number of our state Medicaid customers and response to the COVID-related utilization curtailment, which we experienced in both the second and third quarters, in increase in our G&A spending on activities related to COVID and a meaningful increase to our Medicaid membership. We experienced several significant COVID-related impacts on medical costs in the quarter. First, at the beginning of the quarter, utilization was still moderately curtailed, but rebounded to more normal levels during the quarter. Second, we attracted approximately 300,000 new Medicaid members to Molina since the end of March. And the acuity of that population is clearly lower than the book of business average. And third, direct costs to care for COVID patients totaled $35 million in the quarter. As a resurgence of COVID infections and episodes has occurred in places including Texas and California and disproportionately impacted the marketplace business. In the quarter, the net effect of these three factors reduced normalize medical costs and increased pre-tax earnings by a range of $95 million to $105 million. As you recall, in the second quarter, six of our state customers enacted temporary rate refunds with the stated intent of recouping the portion of our capitated rates not spent on medical costs due to the pandemic. In some of those states, the refund period extended into the third quarter. In addition, during the quarter one additional state Michigan enacted a refund mechanism. In the third quarter, the total impact from COVID-related rate refunds serve to reduce premium revenue and earnings by $88 million on a pre-tax basis. With respect to rate adequacy, we do not intend nor do we want to keep state Medicaid money that was intended to be spent on medical benefits, but was not due to utilization curtailment caused by COVID. In many of our Medicaid states, there are already mechanisms in place to protect against a surplus margin as there are minimum MLRs in seven of our states and profit caps in two others. And once the COVID-19 pandemic abates, we believe that the traditional process of establishing prospective actuarially sound rates based on a credible medical cost baseline and cost trend off that baseline will resume. COVID-related activity increased our third quarter administrative expense by approximately $7 million. We continue to develop a variety of new operational protocols, technology implementations, and benefits for our employees all related to the COVID pandemic and the related increased volume. Medicaid membership increased sequentially by 473,000 in a quarter, a 15% increase. 325,000 of this increase was directly related to the Passport membership and Kentucky, which we assumed on September 1. The addition of the YourCare membership in New York was almost entirely offset by the expected membership decline from the early stages of our Puerto Rico exit. The remaining 148,000 member increase was primarily due to the suspension of redeterminations. As we believe that unemployment related enrollment has not yet materially accessed managed Medicaid. It remains unclear how high the COVID-related membership peak will be, how quickly it will fall as the economy recovers and where it will ultimately settle. However, it does appear that since unemployment nationally is now just under 8% initial industry estimates of unemployment related Medicaid membership increases were overstated. Relatedly, the declaration of the extension of the public health emergency period and the related maintenance of effort extension into next year will likely have a favorable impact. In summary, as we work through this unprecedented period of the COVID pandemic, we remain focused on executing on the underlying fundamentals of our business to continue to produce solid results, regardless of the short-term COVID-related impacts on our reported financial metrics and results. Now I turn to our guidance for the full year. In September 1, we closed on the Passport acquisition and the Commonwealth of Kentucky novated Passport's Medicaid contract to Molina. For 2020, the four months of revenue from this transaction will add approximately $700 million of revenue with negligible earnings. This increase combined with higher Medicaid enrollment through the third quarter, supports the increase in our 2020 total revenue guidance to $19.6 billion from the previous estimate of $18.8 billion. This total revenue guidance for 2020 includes $18.6 billion in premium revenue. Our core performance each quarter has been strong and stable producing at or about $3 of earnings per share. Although this core business performance is expected to remain strong through the fourth quarter, we are choosing to maintain our existing guidance. We take this cautious approach because of the continued uncertainty related to COVID impact on medical costs and the possibility for additional COVID-related rate refunds. We further note that the proceeds from the previously announced favorable settlement with respect to the federal risk corridor litigation will be reported in our fourth quarter. Also in the fourth quarter, we intend to make a sizable contribution to our recently launched MolinaCares charitable foundation. These two items will likely offset each other. When we report our fourth quarter, we will certainly focus on providing a clear view of the earnings power of the business as a baseline for gauging the quality of our 2021 earnings guidance. Shifting the discussion now to our growth initiatives, we made another major stride in the quarter related to the activation of our growth strategy. In September, we signed a definitive agreement to purchase Affinity Health Plan of New York for approximately $380 million. The profile of Affinity is perfectly aligned with our philosophy of staying close to our core business. It is a managed Medicaid business in New York City, as well as surrounding counties and is a nice compliment to the Senior Whole Health business that we are acquiring with the Magellan Complete Care acquisition. Affinity serves approximately 284,000 Medicaid members. Its membership base is stable and the company has very good share in the markets it serves. Affinity's operating infrastructure sound, it has solid provider relationships, a high performing team of enrollment coordinators and a platform, which has the ability to successfully defend and expand its market position. Affinity has not performed to the levels of profitability that Molina has achieved. It therefore provides yet another opportunity for us to bring our operating discipline, business processes and technologies to improve margins and harvest fixed cost leverage with our other New York-based businesses. The transaction is expected to close as early as the second quarter. So the acquisition could provide up to $600 million of revenue for 2021. At a purchase price of less than 30% of reporting revenue, we are projecting excellent returns in excess of our cost of capital. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive by $0.15 to $0.20 adjusted earnings per share in the first 12 months of our ownership. After that initial integration period, we expect to achieve margins consistent with both Molina's performance track record and the industry norm for the New York metro area. The purchase of Affinity is another milestone in a growth oriented 2020. Our growth initiatives continued to be anchored by our capital allocation priorities. First, organic growth of our core businesses, second, inorganic growth through accretive acquisitions, and third programmatically returning excess capital to shareholders. We previously provided you with a 2021 premium revenue outlook. This outlook included a pro forma estimate of the revenue associated with our announced acquisition of Magellan Complete Care, which is on track to close around the end of the year and an estimate of the revenue expected from auto assigned membership and our new Kentucky Medicaid contract. That outlook, which included only a modest early estimate of organic growth, was 2021 premium revenue of $21.5 billion. This 2021 outlook has improved now that we are currently serving all of Passport's existing membership in Kentucky, the majority of which we are expecting to keep. Our expectation is not affected by a court ruling last Friday that a sixth player should be added to the Kentucky Medicaid program for 2021. That ruling did not rescind our Medicaid contract award, does not impact the earlier novation of the Passport Medicaid contract to us and does not affect our status as a current incumbent in the program. Our 2021 outlook has also improved the announcement of the Affinity acquisition. We will provide refined revenue guidance with all the supporting details, when we announce our 2021 full year guidance. There was so much activity related to the political arena, legislative actions and judicial review that we feel obligated to provide some brief commentary on these topics. We have no new perspective to add on the upcoming election, except to say, that all of the most likely potential political outcomes are generally positive for managed Medicaid and related government subsidized programs, although, some political scenarios are more favorable than others. On the legislative front, the recently announced expansion of the COVID public health emergency is likely a positive indicator for continued membership gains and to provide more support for an actuarially sound rate environment. Much has been written and discussed regarding the Affordable Care Act case that is scheduled to be argued before the Supreme Court on November 10. We believe that even if the court were to find the individual mandate to be unconstitutional, it should nevertheless find the individual mandate to be separable from the balance of the law, both as a matter of logic and based on the clear intent of the 2017 Congress, which zeroed out the individual mandate tax penalty. It is also clear as a factual matter that the marketplace business can function effectively without any penalty for failure to purchase health insurance. Regardless of the Supreme Court's ruling, we believe there is a high likelihood of a legislative fix to the law before any final legal opinion would go into effect. As I conclude my remarks, I offer another heartfelt thank you to our management team and our 10,000 associates for delivering excellent results, while dealing with their own stresses and life challenges. Even when facing these challenges, our associates are inspired and motivated by the opportunity to make positive change by delivering high quality healthcare to the country's most vulnerable populations. Our associates continue to excel and I stand in admiration of their dedication and desire to serve our membership base, during these most challenging times. In conclusion, this was yet another meaningful quarter for the company. We are pleased with our third quarter performance, especially, in light of the turbulence caused by the COVID pandemic. We took major steps forward in our transformation. We sustained our margins and did right by our members and customers. We continue to execute on our revenue growth strategy and deployed excess capital in strategic acquisitions. This strong performance points to a very bright future. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for some additional color on the financials. Tom? Sure. Obviously in producing an 81% MCR for the quarter, we clearly underperformed. But 300 basis points of that was directly related to COVID. And it's all geography based. We have, as you know, a significant amount of membership in Texas, there was a COVID spike in Texas, and it's certainly impacted our marketplace business. But even with an ex-COVID MCR of 78%, we underperformed. We've analyzed it thoroughly. It's related to the bronze product. Silver product is performing fine. And we think we're well priced and well positioned and product design and price. We underperformed on two very important operating levers and that is utilization control and the ability to attract and record appropriate risk scores commensurate with the acuity of that population. We have those disciplines in place for our other products and our other businesses through various organizational design issues. We have not yet excelled at those two operating disciplines in the marketplace business and we'll fix that the way we fixed everything else over the last couple of years. It will likely be below. As you know, a couple of years ago, the last time we gave you long-term targets is that our Investor Day, where we suggested that the long-term after tax margin for the marketplace business was 8.5% to 9.5%. We're certainly backing off that long-term target. This is a mid-single-digit business, but the likely to underperform after the year, but I think that's where our long-term margin expectation will lie mid-single-digits. That is correct. In that bronze product, our bronze mix is slightly higher this year than last. And the bronze membership actually had a higher churn. And as you know, when you attract a new member, you're always starting with a risk score of one in new members. They haven't interacted with the healthcare system yet. So you need to work really hard at making sure, you get the right risk scores. So the fact that higher percentage that membership was new and our bronze mix is slightly higher. Product is adequately priced, product design and our zero-based \u2013 our zero premium products are in the right geographies. We're well positioned for next year. The companion question is, did you consider all this and the pricing that you filed recently? The answer is yes. We filed prices that included a very conservative pre-COVID medical cost baseline and reasonably conservative trends off that baseline. So our view, this is not a pricing issue. This is a performance issue, and we plan to get that back next year. No. You're correct. That's net. The gross range of costs curtailment due to the pandemic was $130 million to $140 million and direct costs related to COVID were $35 million, producing the net range of $95 million to $105 million. That is correct. The estimates we gave in the second quarter were net of their direct inpatient medical costs related to COVID. You're welcome. Sure. Well, just to recap the entire year, $75 million when we reported the second quarter due to six enacted retroactive rate refunds all clearly contained and related to COVID curtailment. That same number for the third quarter with $88 million, meaning we've incurred $163 million year-to-date. The third quarter number included one additional state, Michigan that introduced a refund mechanism. And many of those corridors and refund mechanisms extended to the fourth quarter. We haven't disclosed exactly what that number is and obviously depends on a lot of other profitability factors, but various of those mechanisms do extend into the fourth quarter and we'll report that number against the COVID curtailment, just the way we did in the second and the third quarters. Long-term, we are very comfortable at the time tested mechanism of prospective rate development off a credible cost baseline and a reasonable trend off that baseline will resume. These refund mechanisms are clearly related to the recruitment of money that was paid to us with the full intention of us, paying it out to members and benefits and due to COVID that level of utilization didn't occur. So again, very contained, very specific, all related to COVID, when all that the pandemic abates, we believe that the system will function as intended and as time tested process of prospective rate development will resume. It's a really interesting question, because we have begun conversations with many of our state customers about the prospects of moving members, who are no longer eligible for Medicaid, but we're on it due to the redetermination paws, how they will move them off. Obviously, and not for revenue reasons, we're not suggesting that they do it in a stage process for revenue generating reasons. But for the lack of tumult and lack of churn and the disruption, it will create for members who are on Medicaid and are suddenly taken off. So we're certainly arguing and in support of a more staged approach, but our state customers are still deliberating in terms of whether they're going to turn the switch off immediately or whether they're going to face this over time, which again, causes yet another variable. And what the redetermined \u2013 member redetermined patient-based revenue will look like for 2021. How fast those members roll off is still yet to be determined. You're welcome, Justin. Sure. Well, when it comes to our acquisitions, we certainly and the extensive due diligence that we perform. We certainly able to give our investors a clear view of the early accretion, as we've done on Magellan and as we just did on Affinity. When it came to Passport, it was a different model. We actually were buying into a membership base, a revenue stream, not necessarily an earnings stream. So we view Kentucky as sort of a hybrid between a new installation and the integration of a business. Now, as you know, the Passport earnings margin profile was not where Molina has operated in the past. So it's going to take some time to get it there. So we're going to be very cautious with our early estimate of how much \u2013 how many dollars of earnings will flow off the Kentucky Medicaid business in the first year. And when we report our 2021 guidance, we'll certainly have a reasonable estimate at that time. But right now, we are in full mode of analyzing Passport and integrating it due to the contract novation we have getting ready for open enrollment. All those processes are fully in motion. But it's too early to actually have a point estimate on the first year. But I will say that the Passport acquisition clearly allowed us to avoid a lot of the very expensive startup costs that are normally associated with a new contract. The way to think about the capital model goes something like this. You can look at our forecasted earnings and except for the amount of capital that one would need to reserve and it's regulated subsidiaries to fund organic growth, which averages between 8% and 10% of premium. That cash flow ought to be able to be extracted in the form of dividends from our operating subsidiaries. Once it's brought to the parent company, you can put leverage on it and pick a leverage ratio of 50%, you can double your capacity. So earnings less retained capital for organic growth ought to be dividend to the parent doubled the size of it for debt capacity. And that gives your sort of view of how much free cash flow you have available for acquisitions and other activities. Sure, Josh. At the beginning of the quarter, we still had the curtailment effect in place and that sort of evaporated as the quarter moved on. Now, I will tell you that toward the end of the quarter, when the infection rate in many of our geographies and across the nation spikes, we saw a reaction to that. We're learning a lot about consumer behavior and about how the healthcare economy works and how reactive it is. It's very reactive to the COVID infection rate, both in the number of hospitalizations we have directly related to COVID and how quickly elective and discretionary procedures begin to wane when the COVID infection rate is reported. So the healthcare economy is very responsive to that infection rate. And towards the end of the quarter, we saw it spike back a little bit. Not commenting on October at this point, but as I said, it's very, very responsive. And the fact that we're now seeing a resurgence of COVID, I believe, will impact the fourth quarter. You'll see more COVID related costs, and I believe you'll see the shadow effect of continued curtailment. Well, ultimately, the premise of your question is correct. We plan to get these to our target margins, producing 6%, 6.5% EBITDA margins depending on the geography, we plan to get them there. We gave the accretion numbers for Magellan. We just gave them, at least the first 12 months for Affinity. And I would say, you're right, on Kentucky, given that it's a hybrid between an installation and the integration of a non-for-profit plan. I would not giving you a forecast, but I would say that in the first year, that is likely not to perform to our target margin. Let me comment on our margin performance, vis-a\u0300-vis the long-term targets and you're absolutely right. The last time we updated this, which is now some time ago. We gave you a long-term target of 3.8% to 4.2% and we just produced a quarterly margin of 3.7%, which had somebody you have recognized falls just slightly out of that range. I will remind you that 3.8% to 4.2% included a marketplace target of 8.5% to 9.5%, which were clearly going to come off of that's going to land in mid-single-digits, not picking a point estimate now. So the fact that we're actually able to produce 3.7% after tax, when the marketplace this quarter was breakeven. I think we're still in the strike zone of our long-term targets, even though, we can pullback our projection of what the marketplace business will produce. And the fact that we're not the chatter two years ago, and it was legitimate was that our financial profile was over-relying \u2013 over reliance on marketplace revenues and profits. That's certainly not the case anymore, but if we can produce, our long-term part of margins having pulled back our marketplace estimates, I think that's certainly bodes well for the future. Yes, I mean the entire industry is facing the same challenges. As you know in order to get the right codes and the right interventions, people need to go to the doctor. And when they stopped going to the doctor and the hospital, you don't have the data to support their risks. Some of these require face-to-face interventions. We have a fantastic arm of our business with nurse practitioners and visit patients in their home. They were unable to do that for a long period of time. So we're sort of facing the same headwind that the rest of the industry is facing with respect to the attainment of risk scores. But as the economy opens up as people get back into the field, again we think this will come back quickly. We know how to get them. We know how to chase the charts, get the codes. And when the world returns to normal movements in consumer activity, we believe this thing snaps back into place. As you know the marketplace business reacts quickly to risk adjustment to immediate Medicare like one year delayed and Medicaid two years delayed. So there's a lag effect. But we believe as the world comes back to normal, we'll be able to get our metrics back to where they need to be as well the rest of the industry. Sure. There are some new entrants that have entered some of our states, but you know who the big competitors are. We operate at a much different level than many of our competitors that we are going after the highly subsidized members who perhaps just earn a little more money than that would qualify them for Medicaid and we're leveraging our Medicaid network. So we're in a slice of the market that's heavily dependent on the federal subsidy. We think we can grow the pool of profits, trust management to pick the right geographies, push price and ease up on membership or to ease on price to push membership. We'll make those judgments geography by geography, depending on the strength of the competition, the strength of our network. And we believe as we always have that we can grow the pool of profits. Obviously we'll be growing it off of a smaller base, even our performance this year, but we're still pretty confident we can do that. Well, fair point. And obviously, you're always balancing those dynamics against where the population is. And if you want to be in the Medicaid business, you can't ignore places like California and New York where the Medicaid population live. So clearly a New York Metro is a place we want it to be. We have a nice blend of business there now. We have a traditional Medicaid business with the purchase of affinity, and we have a managed long-term care business with the purchase of senior whole health in New York. And you're right. New York is clearly has budget pressures and lots of other factors that are indigenous to New York. But in buying these properties and projecting the earning stream off of which they're valued, we certainly took all of that into consideration. So when you're an incumbent, those things happen, you might have some issues, but when you're contemplating all those puts and takes, when you're valuing a property in order to buy it, we're pretty comfortable that we pay for them correctly. We considered all the puts and takes that could happen in both New York Metro and the State of New York. And we're very comfortable that these are going to create long-term value with the accretion numbers we've given. Sorry, George, I couldn't hear the first part of your question. Which business were you referring to? And we try to be very clear and transparent if we have an operating issue that didn't meet our expectations, but I think we need to put a box around this. Our entire marketplace business is 8% of our total revenue and to bronze business is about a quarter of the total marketplace business. It did underperform, but this is boxed, it's contained, it's identified, it's clearly related to operational performance. And we fixed so many operating protocols, introduced so many different performance improvement initiatives over the past couple of years. We're going to fix this. Again, when you look at where it is and how much of the company's profile, it actually consumes, it is a very contained, easy to fix issue. So I don't want to have this painted with a broad brush, because it's very specific and very contained. No, we haven't. We continue to see the redetermination pause. Last quarter, we broke protocol by giving an inner quarter update. I'll do the same now. We saw more membership increase in October. I think the number of increase is slightly over 30,000 in the month of October so far. Now that will be offset by our Puerto Rico exit. But in terms of new members coming on through redetermination, it continues into the quarter. But no, as we said in our prepared remarks, how high does the people be, how far \u2013 how quickly it will fall off as the economy approves. And to the point someone made earlier, how will the states actually unwind this in a staged approach or in a sudden approach is still yet to be determined. So no, we have not given any impact of this on our revenue forecast either for the balance for 2021. It certainly increased our revenue outlook for the rest of the year. Yes, that is accurate. We received it, $128 million pre-tax. It will be reported in the fourth quarter. And we are likely to have an offsetting amount in the quarter where we will be making a sizable contribution to our new 501(c)(3) charitable trust called the MolinaCares cord foundation. So likely a wash in the quarter when we report the fourth quarter, but yes, $128 million was the pre-tax number. And much of that will be deposited or contributed, I should say to our 501(c)(3) trust. Well, we have \u2013 we run a fine business in Ohio with 12%, 15% market share. We're well-positioned across the entire state. And obviously we have our A team on this to key state for us. And we're very confident that we'll submit a high quality proposal. That'll be scored well. But it's a re-procurement and we'll submit it on November 20 when it's due. And when the announcement comes out, we'll certainly report that, but we have our ATM on this. We run a great business there. And we have every reason to believe we'll be successful. And not only retaining, but perhaps even expanding. It's unclear. And we don't want to get ahead of our customer on this one, because they have the jurisdiction over how to allocate in a portion membership. But yes, that's the way we're thinking about it. We are an incumbent. We're servicing 320,000 members today as we sit here today through the Passport brand, out of the Molina Healthcare, Kentucky legal entity. And when you introduce a six player, if in fact that's what's done, we believe the state will have to go through some process of reapportioning members. How that's done through auto assignment through or judgment. We just don't know, and we don't want to speculate, but that is the practical implication of that ruling that was made last Friday introduction of the six player, which will have to be a portion membership. The reason that it's less pronounced on the Medicaid MLRs, it's a more diversified book of business in 15 states. So no, I mean there's California was certainly a pressure point in all of our businesses with COVID as was Texas. But it's just less pronounced in Medicaid just because of the geographic diversification that we have. Yes, perfectly. No, I think the actually the word you use to ask the question are actually reflective of the situation. There's clearly more uncertainty and risks to consider. As you move from this very intentive COVID pandemic into what may be a less intentive COVID pandemic environment. But all the puts and takes on managing a managed Medicaid business are certainly in play. It's \u2013what is the medical cost baseline look like for next year? How it will be influenced by COVID either increased or decreased by direct COVID or COVID curtailment. And then how that cost baseline is reflected in rates. We have good visibility into our rates at this early stage. We are for 2021 revenue base, we know about \u2013 we know the rates and about 40% of the revenue base at this point. When we give guidance in February, we'll understand the rates and about 70% of our revenues. So we'll have good visibility into that. And the conversations we're having with our state customers are very balanced. They're actuarially sound. They're based on reasonable cost baselines. But to me, the big issues that you always consider going into a year when you're trying to forecast earnings is medical cost projection, and how rates will be reflective of that medical cost baseline. And those certainly are the two issues that have to be considered as you look forward to next year. Not to mention the accretion that we're going to produce from the recent acquisitions that we've integrated."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Trudell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Molina Healthcare. Please go ahead.\nJulie Trudell: Good morning and welcome to Molina Healthcare's second quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Tom Tran. A press release announcing our second quarter earnings was distributed yesterday after the market closed and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of the call, a replay of this call will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made herein are as of today Friday, July 31, 2020, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our second quarter 2020 press release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic environment, recent acquisitions, 2020 guidance, and our longer term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K Annual Report for the 2019 year filed with the SEC, as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and our Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to take your questions. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Thank you, Julie, and good morning. Today, we would like to provide you with updates on a number of topics. First, we will cover the enterprise-wide financial results for the second quarter; second and relatedly, we will discuss the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on various aspects of our business; third, we will convey our guidance in the context of our second quarter results and this new but temporary operating environment; and fourth and lastly, we will provide a premium revenue growth outlook for 2021 which is approximately 20% as we now emerge from pivoting to growth to activating our growth phase. Let me start with specific second quarter highlights. Last night we reported earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $4.65 with net income of $276 million. These results were supported by an MCR of 82.3%, a G&A ratio of 7.5% and an after tax margin of 6%. Our year-to-date earnings per diluted share is now $7.54 representing 66% of our full-year guidance. The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on many aspects of our quarterly results. Some of these impacts increased earnings while others served to decrease earnings. While many of these impacts are known and estimable, others require significant judgment to estimate. Today, we will do our best to quantify the COVID impacts on our results and separate them from the underlying core earnings power of the business. In doing so, two things are clear. Our operating metrics were substantially in line with our expectations, both as reported and as adjusted for COVID impacts and both our core earnings and the growth trajectory of our business have not been disrupted by the short-term impacts of COVID. We estimate that taken together all COVID impacts on our financial results for the quarter resulted in an increase in net income in a range of $65 million to $100 million, equating to an increase in earnings per diluted share in a range of $1.10 to $1.65. Now I will provide some highlights related to our second quarter results from an enterprise perspective. Beginning with revenue, our premium revenues of $4.1 billion increased by 8% over the prior year. Relatedly, our membership increased sequentially by 151,000 members or 4% primarily in Medicaid. With respect to medical costs with an 82.3% MCR our performance was also strong, although significantly augmented by COVID impacts. Although in many cases we were required to relax our utilization management and payment integrity regimes as an accommodation to providers. We continue to effectively manage medical costs while ensuring all of our members receive high-quality care. This MCR result was impacted by two directionally different factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We experienced lower than expected medical costs due to COVID related utilization curtailment, a phenomenon that may or may not recur during the balance of the year and a number of our state Medicaid customers enacted retroactive rate refunds. In the quarter the lower medical costs and the retroactive rate refunds combined to reduce our reported medical care ratio by an estimated 300 to 400 basis points, which account for substantially all of the reduction in the ratio both year-over-year and sequentially. All of the COVID impacts on our second quarter results will be describe in more detail in a few moments. Next, we continued to effectively manage our administrative costs through productivity gains and fixed cost leverage, producing a G&A ratio of 7.5%. This is despite spending on specific COVID related items, which temporarily increased our administrative spending. Our net investment income usually not in earnings item with significant variability was again unusually low at $18 million compared to $34 million a year ago due to the current low interest rate environment. Our line of business results were very much in line with our expectations with strong metrics in both Medicaid and Medicare, while our marketplace results were slightly lower than expected due to a higher than expected member acuity mix. Finally in the quarter, we continued to improve our capital structure. We issued $800 million of high-yield bonds used to retire short-term floating rate debt. We also upsized our revolver to $1 billion from its previous level of $500 million. These are more than mere transactions. They are the culmination of a two-year long and highly successful restructuring and optimization of our capital structure. We are now positioned with well priced debt, nicely lathered [ph] maturities, solid credit metrics and ample dry powder to execute on M&A opportunities if and when those opportunities arise. In summary, we continued to perform well across the many fundamentals of managed care, which has been our hallmark and we are continuing to grow revenue as a result of our focus on topline growth. Now, I will provide some commentary about the effects of COVID on our second quarter results. The COVID impacts on our quarterly results include, a decrease in medical costs due to COVID related utilization curtailment, offset by direct care related to COVID patients. Retroactive rate refunds to a number of our state Medicaid customers, an increase in our G&A spending on activities related to COVID and a meaningful increase to our Medicaid membership. As previously mentioned, we estimate that taken together all COVID impacts on our financial results for the quarter, have produced an increase in net income in a range of approximately $65 million to $100 million, equating to an increase in earnings per diluted share in a range of $1.10 to $1.65. I will now provide more color on the most significant factors contributing to this. With respect to the COVID impacts on medical costs, early in the quarter we experienced significantly lower utilization in a variety of cost categories, categories representing approximately two thirds of our total spend with utilization levels increasing slowly as the quarter progressed. By the end of the quarter, utilization in these categories were still approximately 10% lower than we would have normally expected. The medical cost categories most impacted were elective surgeries, services in ambulatory settings, ER visits, behavioral services and wellness and preventive services. We also incurred a direct cost to care for COVID patients with just over 4100 hospitalizations and average inpatient episode cost of $9000 plus the cost of outpatient and other professional services. The cost per COVID episode varies widely depending on the acuity of the patient. We estimate that COVID lowered our second quarter medical costs by $190 million to $240 million. As you know, as a general matter, there are fewer elective procedures performed under the Medicaid program than is the case with commercial health insurance. Since our book of business is heavily weighted to Medicaid, the effect on us of elective procedure curtailment is therefore less pronounced. Six of our state customers enacted temporary retroactive rate refunds during the quarter, with the intent of recouping the portion of our capitated rates not spent on healthcare services due to the pandemic. In the quarter these refunds amounted to $75 million pretax and related to the states of Ohio, Illinois, California, South Carolina, Mississippi, and Washington. Some items of note. The refunds in these states took various forms ranging from simple rate adjustment to a slightly more complex risk sharing [indiscernible] around a target medical loss ratio, as well as supplemental payments to providers. In many of our states however, it was business as usual as we continued to operate on the pre-COVID rate structure. Our position on rate adequacy has been consistent. We do not intend, nor do we want to keep state Medicaid money that was intended to be spent on medical benefits or was not due to utilization curtailment caused by COVID. In many of our Medicaid states, there are already mechanisms in place to protect against a surplus margin as there are minimum MLRs in seven of our states and profit caps in two others. The FMAP increase and potential additional FMAP increases should significantly relieve any potential rate pressure in our states and CMS has authority to approve or disapprove proposed rate actions that are not aligned with the definition of actuarial soundness. Once the COVID pandemic abates, we believe that the traditional process of establishing prospective actuarial sound rates based on a credible medical cost baseline and cost trend of that baseline will continue. With respect to our G&A expenses, COVID related activity increased our second quarter expenses by approximately $25 million. A variety of new operational protocols, technology implementations, and benefits for our employees, all related to the COVID pandemic were established or implemented during the quarter. In addition, we have consciously managed our headcount at above optimal levels to ensure we maintain adequate service levels, but also to be socially responsible to our dedicated staff. Medicaid membership increased sequentially by 152,000 members in the quarter, a 5% increase. Much of this was due to the suspension of redeterminations as we believe that unemployment related enrollment has not yet materially accessed managed Medicaid. It remains unclear how high the membership peak will be, how quickly it will be attained, how quickly it will fall as the economy recovers and where it will ultimately settle. We have invested in many local growth initiatives with providers in branding and awareness campaigns and in social media outreach to ensure we obtain our fair share of increased membership. We believe that post COVID Medicaid membership will stabilize at and increased level as the future natural unemployment rate will likely be higher than previously experienced. In summary, as we work through this unprecedented period, we remain focused on executing on the underlying fundamentals of our business regardless of the short term COVID related impacts on our reported financial results. Now I'll turn to our guidance for the full year. Our full year earnings guidance range remains at $11.20 to $11.70 per diluted share with a midpoint of $11.45. Our earnings per share EBITDA [ph] is $7.54, which means through six months we have earned 66% of our revised guidance. Given the environmental uncertainty that we expect to exist through the end of the year, we are not adjusting the range of our previously provided earnings per share guidance. We intend to adjust our full year outlook as appropriate when our third quarter results are reported. The reasons for this cautious approach have always been stated, but bear repeating. The near-term outlook for medical costs, the cost of COVID and the potential elective procedure rebound, are unknown at this time. There is still potential for additional near-term rate actions or voluntary company concessions to customers, members and providers. We will fulfill our obligation to make any rebate to member, CMS or our state customers related to the statutory requirements that exist today. After doing so, if we conclude that there is still a remaining financial imbalance, we will correct that imbalance. Our membership forecast has a wide range of possible outcomes as there are numerous macroeconomic variables in play and relatedly the acuity of any potential membership increase and the cost of services are also highly variable. And lastly, we believe that any methodology for extrapolating annual earnings estimates by quarter should be suspended in ones thinking. I would now like to turn to the progress we have made in executing our growth strategy, which is having an immediate impact and which allows us to forecast premium revenue growth of approximately 20% for 2021. We have essentially checked the box on at least one initiative across all the revenue growth dimensions outlined in our growth strategy. We have retained all of our existing Medicaid contracts. We have won a new state contract and we have executed meaningful and accretive acquisitions. And with the impact of the recession, organic growth would be much better than expected. Some highlights. Based on announced re-procurement schedules, the revenue associated with our current in-force Medicaid contract should be intact through 2021, plus we have significant certainty related to 2022. The new management team has won or defended all of the re-procurements that were under its control. We assumed the YourCare membership on July 1st which will increase membership by 47,000 members in the third quarter, and should provide approximately $140 million of revenue for the remainder of 2020 and $280 million for the full year 2021. The Magellan Complete Care regulatory review process is proceeding as planned. Recall that the Federal antitrust approval is complete and the state approval processes are progressing. We hope to close the transaction by the end of the year and if we do this acquisition will provide the previously announced $2.8 billion of revenue in 2021. For every month the closing would be delayed beyond the first of the year that annual revenue estimate would decrease proportionately. Our Kentucky RFP win will have contracts start date of January 1, 2021. Before considering any of the potential benefits of the Passport acquisition under a conservative set of membership assignment assumptions, the contract should provide at least $850 of revenue in 2021 with upside potential into 2022 as membership organically builds. Organic same-store membership growth, increased product penetration in our nascent Navajo Nation project would also modestly contribute to the 2021 revenue growth rate. Finally, as previously announced, we're exiting the Medicaid business in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. We have reached an agreement to execute an orderly transition of our members to an on-Island competitor. The unwinding will be completed by November 1, and the impact of the transaction itself and the contract exit are not financially material. Under these assumptions, we project 2021 premium revenue of approximately $21.5 billion. We are very pleased with a 20% increase in premium revenue as we move from pivoting to growth to fully activating our top line growth strategy. Another major development in activating our growth strategy was our recently announced transaction to purchase certain Passport assets. The transaction is expected to close before the end of 2020, providing us with a well known brand in Kentucky, a turnkey operation and the opportunity to gain additional membership. Passport represents potential upside to our 2020 and 2021 revenue guidance. The purchase price for Passport is approximately $20 million plus contingent consideration payable in 2021, based on the level of enrollment retained above a certain threshold. A few words about the Passport transaction and its benefits. We will acquire the Passport brand name, all its operating infrastructure, and we will assume approximately 500 highly trained Kentucky based Passport and Evolent employees. The acquisition allows us to enhance operational readiness in advance of our new contract award in Kentucky, and enables continuity of care for Passport members. The acquisition allows us to avoid startup losses, inevitably associated with building a Greenfield health plan, and the early lack of scale. The acquisition allows us to compete more effectively for additional membership above what we might have ordinarily received from the standard auto assignment process related to our own contract award. And from a financial perspective, we expect to recover the purchase price from positive cash flow in less than one year, as the plan would be immediately profitable and is likely to produce membership well above what we might have achieved organically. It is also important to know that the membership revenue in earnings, related to Passport could all commence and begin to impact our results on or about September 1, if the Commonwealth of Kentucky approves our joint request for an early contract novation. This would be a very positive outcome, although it would impact the year-over-year revenue growth rate calculation. As I conclude my remarks. I take a pause from discussing our operating and financial performance and instead, comment on our compassion or humanity. During this unprecedented time, our company made many significant contributions to charitable, and community causes. We offered financial assistance to distressed providers, and worked with our State customers to understand where they saw human tragedies unfold and offered our financial and operational assistance. We will continue to do so. And in fact, we are developing plans to deepen our social commitment to build stronger communities, one life at a time. I offer another heartfelt thank you to our management team, and our 10,000 associates who are executing well while dealing with their own stresses and issues related to the pandemic and racial strife. Even when facing these challenges, our associates are inspired and motivated by the opportunity to make positive change by delivering high quality healthcare to the disadvantaged. Our associates continue to excel and I stand in admiration of their dedication and their will to sacrifice in the face of all types of adversity. In conclusion, this was a meaningful quarter for the company. Our results met our expectations, despite the turbulence caused by the COVID pandemic. We took major steps forward in our transformation. We sustained our margins, but did right by our members and customers. We fully activated our revenue growth strategy and continued to deploy excess capital in strategic acquisitions. This level of performance provides an insightful glimpse into our very bright future. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for some additional color on the financials. Tom?\nThomas Tran: Thank you, Joe and good morning. First, I will comment on our balance sheet, cash flow, and capital. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and reserve positions remain strong. Days in claim payable represent 52 days of medical cost expense, compared to 49 days in the first quarter of 2020, and 48 days in the second quarter of 2019. The sequential increase was driven by lower medical expense in the current quarter, due to the impact of COVID. Reserved development for the first six months of 2020 was negligible compared to favorable development, which decreased our MCR by 110 basis points in the comparable period in 2019. Operating cash flow for the second quarter of 2020 were $630 million, reflecting the strong operating result, and the timing of government receipts and payments. We attract $185 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, which brought our parent company cash balance to $1.2 billion, and give us ample flexibility to fund our recent acquisitions and organic growth initiatives. Debt at the end of the quarter is nearly 1.6 times trolling per month EBITDA. Our leverage ratio is 60.7%. However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, the leverage ratio is only 30.7%. Taken together, these metrics reflect a conservative leveraged position. Our $800 million high yield offering was priced at 4 and 3.8%, indicating that the debt markets view our credit quality at a level that should provide a path for a ratings upgrade in the near future. As of June 30, 2020, our health plans at total statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2.1 billion, which equates to approximately 350% of risk based capital. Now turning to our 2020 guidance. Our full year's earnings guidance range is $11.20 to $11.70 per diluted share. We increased our full year 2020 total revenue outlook to approximately $18.8 billion from $18.3 billion, mainly due to a higher Medicaid enrollment through the first half of the year, as well as revenue from YourCare membership, that is effective July 1, 2020. In taking this cautious approach to providing earnings guidance for the balance of the year, we have considered a wide range of potential outcomes from the factors that Joe previously described. Now I offer some additional items of note. The low yield environment and its drag on investment income should persist in the second half. We are likely to incur additional administrative expenses for COVID related operating protocols. We are also going to incur costs associated with the launch of our new Kentucky contract and integration costs associated with the Magellan Complete Care acquisition. And lastly as a reminder, consistent with our historical practice, previously announced acquisition that have not yet closed are excluded from our guidance. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. First question just on how you're thinking about the progression of Medicaid membership through the year. I think you added, you said about 4% of membership in the quarter on the Medicaid side. How do you expect to end the year on Medicaid and specifically can you delineate how much of that membership you expect to carve from this lack of disenrollment? And how are you treating that going into 2021 in terms of how you think that kind of - how long that lasts, given the FMAP and the health [ph] emergency status uncertainty?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Sure, Justin this is Joe. We grew membership sequentially in Medicaid by 152,000 members at 5%. We believe with really good information that most of that was the result of the suspension of redetermination; that the unemployment surge that is likely to come to manage Medicaid has not yet occurred due to a variety of reasons, spousal coverage, COBRA and backlogs in the various states. Certainly we expect that membership to be on the books for a while. We know it will hit a peak and we also know that as the economy recovers, it will begin to trip [ph]. We do not yet, we have various forecasts of how much membership we are likely to have at the end of the year as a result of all this. But I think we're comfortable in saying that our Medicaid membership will be higher than previously forecasted as a result of COVID. But we have not put a point estimate on that. It's still way too many variables to put a point estimate on how many members we're likely to get. I will say this, through the first three weeks of July the Medicaid membership continued to grow by about 30,000 members organically in the first three weeks of July.\nJustin Lake: That's helpful. Thanks for that. And then just last question on the exchange performance. You noted little bit higher costs due to higher acuity, can you flesh that out a little bit for us? And then, should we assume that you were able to catch that early enough for 2021 bids? And any color you can give us in terms of how you're thinking about, where you did, for margins in 2021 and that exchange business that would be helpful? Thanks.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Sure. In our marketplace business, our silver bronze mix didn't change all that much. But we did have a churn in the bronze membership we took on, so we had many new members in our bronze product. The MLR ran higher on those numbers than we had expected. It's either higher medical \u2013 if you are attracting the right risk or it's either mismanagement of your medical cost line, but if you're managing medical costs effectively, which we think we are, then the risk scores just haven't been commensurate. So we'll catch up and we'll get the risk scores in line with the acuity of the membership. But that's the reason for the small shortfall in our marketplace business for the quarter. With respect to the business, yes we projected a medical costs baseline on COVID impacted use 2019 is the medical costs baseline and then trended forward without any COVID impacts. So we believe that the rates we filed for 2021 are solid, fully contemplated all the costs related to medical services for our members, and the scores that we will attain.\nJustin Lake: Great thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. I wanted to ask about that the rate environment, how should we think about the $75 million number? You characterize it as retroactive? Does that mean that there's not expected to be a go forward impact or is they also a go forward impact on these initiatives in your guidance?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Well, the retroactive refunds that we record in the quarter really are a reflection of exactly how the rate apparatus should work. Obviously, rates never contemplated this rather dramatic curtailment in utilization. So whether states enact refunds themselves or whether the minimum MLRs in seven of our States get triggered, the money is rightfully going back to the States because it wasn't spent on benefits for their beneficiaries. So we recorded the retroactive component, either back to in some cases back to March in some cases back to the beginning of the year. And certainly we contemplated the forward looking aspects of those rate decreases and refunds, as we provided our very cautious outlook to the balance of the year. So the 75 million was truly the retroactive component that takes us through June 30, but we certainly contemplated the continuation of those refunds that have already been enacted, and obviously the potential for more actions to be enacted by our State customers.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay, that's helpful. And then, I guess it was a little bit confusing. It sounded Joe like you were saying that MCC is in your revenue, guidance for 2021. But then Tom mentioned that you don't include deals until they are closed. I just wanted to make sure I understood how the treatment of MCC in that 2021?\nJoseph Zubretsky: That's a fair point. I think I'm going to use that as the opportunity to make sure we clarify the outlook we're giving for premium revenue in 2021. First thing, I would say is, you know, our revised forecast for 2020 is $17.8 billion of premium revenue, which is a 10% increase over 2019. That's a pretty strong pivot. Now as we really activate the growth strategy, projecting a 20% growth rate off of 2020 is certainly something we're pleased with. And yes, it does contemplate the Magellan Complete Care acquisition closing on January 1. For every month it would be delayed you can proportionately reduce that. But we expect it to close at the earliest by the end of the year, but no later than the end of the first quarter. We also included the organic component of our Kentucky contract, meaning an amount of revenue in Kentucky that we estimate we would get through the normal auto assignment process. We did not include any potential benefits of additional membership that we'll get through the ownership of the Passport brand and the potential innovation of that contract early in the fall. Also, it's important to note that we've decided to exit Puerto Rico, which leaves $400 million of revenue in 2019 will not be in the 2020 rate, and, of course, a modest, very modest and cautious forecast of organic growth. So that's sort of how we compiled our rather conservative outlook for 2021 and we really wanted to just begin framing the story as we really activate our growth strategy, we wanted to give a forward look, a leading indicator, an outlook of where our revenue line is headed.\nKevin Fischbeck: That's supposed to clarify the last point. My last question here, we say for next year modest organic growth, what are you assuming as far as unemployment next year versus this year?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Yes. We have various forecasts on where, as I said, in the previous question, I was asked of where the Medicaid membership will go. And, as I said, we're just we're taking it week-by-week. We - membership grew again in the month of July. We expect it to grow again in August and perhaps through September as that unemployment surge comes through. But it's just so really hard to project. The way I would think about it is, is and what I'm holding my team accountable to, we should do no worse than our market share in those markets. Hopefully, we'll gain market share on this process, but if you take our market share, that would be a good proxy for - if Medicaid enrollment grows by a certain percent we should at least get our market share.\nKevin Fischbeck: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matthew Borsch of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Borsch: Yes, hi. I was hoping maybe you could just elaborate a little bit further on your outlook for Medicaid and the rate actions. I understand you're saying that when we get past COVID-19 that you expect we'll continue to have rates set according to actuarial soundness. But, and also recognize referring to a number of states where already existing risk sharing mechanisms have kicked in, where you have exceeded or I should say, come in well under the medical budget target. But what do you have \u2013 if anything to send off at this point, and how are you doing that in terms of states under fiscal pressures? Well, you guys clearly are doing too well with this rate right here, proposals to cut and so forth.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Sure. Well, Matt, the conversations with our various day customers have been very balanced and very rational. And they do understand the principle that it has the force of federal law of actuarial soundness, which in the CMS approval process they take very seriously as well. Clearly, the actions that have been taken are related to COVID. That's - that has occupied the conversation. We clearly understand that there are other budget pressures in the states that are causing them to look at Medicaid with a very, very sharp pencil. But you can't recruit money in Medicaid rates to balance your budget. That violates the concept of actuarial soundness. The rates have to reflect that the services that we intend to allow members to have and I think the rate environment will persist through all this. As I said, we'll go back to a point where on a prospective basis, we agreed to statistically credible medical cost baseline, a reasonable trend off that baseline. And, the - that has served managed Medicaid well over many, many years.\nMatthew Borsch: Understood. And, I realized that the timing is in different places for different states. But when would you expect to get into the most intense period of discussions over new rate proposals?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Well, as you know, our rates contract years span from January 1 to July to September. So we're always in some type of discussion with our customers about rates. And, as we emerge through this COVID period, we have to adjust for the effects of COVID. Are the effects of COVID going to last into the 2021 baseline? Right now, they could, but we just don't know. So I wouldn't want to divulge any particular conversation we're having with states, but the discussion about how long COVID will last, and what that medical cost baseline needs to reflect, is just an ongoing state-by-state discussion.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Tanal of SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.\nStephen Tanal: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question and all the color today. I guess, one thing I wanted to follow up on was just, Joe the $21.5 billion outlook the greater than and as it relates to Kentucky, I just wanted to get a sense of first, I guess, maybe confirm the math. I think if the state approves that you guys can keep Passport 315,000 members it would probably add another billion dollars of premium revenue on top of this outlook based on, how you guys have assumed it right now. So first I want to understand if I have that right, and maybe if there's anything else you can tell us about what Kentucky said so far with respect to whether they'll allow you to keep those numbers in place.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Your math is precisely correct. We assumed through an auto assignment process that we\u2019d likely get 140,000 members, which is why we put an estimate of $850 million into our forecast. And we just didn't want to be presumptive. We're buying the Passport operating assets and the brand name. The membership has to be assigned to us through the state approval process. But you're absolutely right. If we obtained all 350,000 members that would represent a little over a $1 billion of upside to the $21.5 billion estimate that we've given you. I will say this, while we're still in the approval process, so I don't want to go into any particular conversations we've had, continuity of care is really, really important to our customers, stability of the network, continuity of the care plans, particularly for the high acuity population is really, really important to our customer. So we believe what one of the potentials for this transaction is to keep either all or many of the 350,000 members that are now in the Passport plan. That was certainly the intention that we had in mind when we bought the Passport assets. So, continuity of care, really, really important to the customer and stability of network, and if we are able to keep many of those members, those objectives will have been met.\nStephen Tanal: Great, that's really helpful. And then I guess just as a follow-up on this point, it sounds like Magellan Complete Care at least inside this initial target is good for about $2.8 billion. Obviously it can move around a little depending on the close, but we can use that and back into I think that, that level of organic growth you spoke to and framed as conservative, I think it's about 5%, correct me if I'm wrong, but how do you think about that 5%? I mean, what is the potential for upside there? And how conservative do you think that is? Maybe talk about where it comes from Medicaid, Medicare, et cetera?\nJoseph Zubretsky: We continue to believe that we'll grow our marketplace product. Our DSNP product is doing really, really well. We clearly have plans to grow market share, as I outlined at are Investor Day over a year ago, putting in the operational protocols to make sure that we have less leakage on redetermination than we've had in the past, and that through additional branding and awareness campaigns at the local level, we attract more membership through the voluntary process. Improving our risk scores and our quality scores I should say, to move up higher in the auto assignment algorithms. So we have plans to grow organically. I would call it small bolt-on acquisitions as good as organic, particularly at the prices we're paying. So, I'd stay at the cautious and conservative estimate, and that's the way I would think about it.\nStephen Tanal: Awesome. Maybe if I could just slip in one more, I was just curious to know how much minimum medical loss ratio rebate accruals may dampen the sort of downside of the year on your decline and MCR and maybe same question on premium refund, and I guess prior year development from the roll forward table on a gross basis looks like it was negative in the quarter, so wondering if minimum MLRs were a factor there as well, so maybe any color there would be helpful and then I'll yield thanks.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Now, after we recorded the premium refunds, the minimum MLRs did not have any impact in the quarter, no material impact on our financial results. Now going forward, again depends where COVID takes the medical cost line. It depends where the retroactive rate refunds kick-in. But we, again through whatever mechanism there is, we actually prefer and intend to make sure that we don't keep state money that was paid to us for servicing members that wasn\u2019t due to the pandemic. So whether it's through the retroactive rate refund, whether it's through the minimum MLR mechanism or whether it's just voluntary, working with our state customer to make directed payments to providers to add value added benefits for members or just to give them the money back, we think that's the responsible way to behave in a global pandemic with our Medicaid customers.\nStephan Tanal: Helpful, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Joe, a little bit of a followup to the last answer that you just gave, trying to get a sense, you've named I believe, six states that enacted retros, seven have MLR's, two more have profit caps. I guess I'm wondering how much of those, overlap or kind of complement to that question would be, how many states are naked on this issue, how many states do not have a mechanism or have not enacted a mechanism yet to recoup money in this environment?\nJoseph Zubretsky: I would say that the states of - the states that haven't yet, are Washington - Washington have directed payments, but no, Washington and Texas, no. Florida and Michigan, have not. New York hasn't. So, those are the states, Wisconsin hasn't. Those are the states that haven't yet, and I don't have the list in front of me of where the MLRs are, but the MLRs are 85 or 86 and those could get tripped and probably in a marginal way, but those are the states that haven't enacted anything yet. And as I said, we'll wait and see, when something's enacted, how they're enacted, what retro period they apply to, et cetera.\nDavid Windley: Sure.\nJoseph Zubretsky: But that's the, that's the outlook.\nDavid Windley: Got it. I appreciate that. And just, just thinking, I guess, wondering how states fiscal years and their budget balancing activity come into play in their thinking, in your negotiations. If - if they don't have or don't enact a mechanism to recoup that money in the 2020 fiscal year, does that increase the likelihood that they try to take that out in rates in 2021? Understanding your comments about actuarial soundness, not sure how those would - is that - is that explicitly a year by year thing or could that take into account, kind of a two-year forecast in the way they're looking at that actuarial soundness level?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Well, certainly we have, we follow very, very closely all of the budget and legislative activity with our state customers. Obviously, it gives you a sense of hope, repeat their budgets are with tax revenues or not, so we certainly follow it. Many of our states have already passed budgets, many of them passed budgets a year ago that are two years in duration, where we haven't had any conversations about rates. But many are in the process. Certain of them are in process. So we certainly keep our eye on it, but as I said before, you can't use Medicaid rates to recoup tax revenues. They have to reflect the services that you intend to pay for members. And as I said on the last earnings call, there is no question that as the economy moves up and down and state budgets are either very strong or on the weaker side, then rates would be on the stronger side of actuarial soundness when the economy is really robust, and might be on the weaker side of actuarial soundness when the economy is flat. And again, there is the offsetting impact of more membership or fewer members. So, it modulates and it's all manageable. But as I said, actuarial soundness has to reflect the cost of healthcare services for your members and you can't recoup budget deficits with Medicaid money.\nDavid Windley: Right, understood. Last question here, you've alluded to even voluntary give backs in or that that's something that you would contemplate is, are those actions, and I guess I'm wondering how formalized are some of those actions in your plans, and have you taken those into account in the reconfirmed guidance that you're making today. I'm just wondering, if you do decide to make voluntary payments, how might we account for those or learn of those?\nJoseph Zubretsky: It certainly was contemplated in the very cautious outlook we gave for the second half. I would state it this way. A state might decide that they will take the action to recoup the money that wasn't paid in benefits through these rate refunds. If they don't do that and we trigger a minimum MLR, then we have to pay it back by regulation. If neither of those two things exist or happen and we still think that we inappropriately or inadvertently, unexpectedly benefited by this curtailment of utilization, we would work with our state customer and work on a program of either additional value added benefits for members, directed payments to stressed or distressed providers or just give them the money back. We just don't think it's helpful for the Managed Care industry to sort of have a surplus margin related to curtailed utilization in a pandemic and we'll report that as we report our third and fourth quarters, we will report to the extent we trigger minimum MLRs, we have retroactive rate refunds where we voluntarily granted money back to our customer.\nDavid Windley: Very clear. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCharles Rhyee: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. Joe, obviously it seems like a lot of this when you guys gave you our outlook last quarter, you gave yourself a lot of room for a lot of this uncertainty and then we're seeing some of that a little bit play out. And obviously, at the same time, you've been able to maintain your earnings outlook for the full year here. But within that, were you surprised at although with how some of these adjustments came or was this sort of what you are already in discussions with states, at that time that you kind of reported last quarter. So it was sort of within the range of what you're expecting? And then sort of just a followup on the last question here, obviously several other states here that you're saying that you really don't have mechanisms in place, are those discussions, are there discussions ongoing with them currently? So it's a question of whether they make a decision to do something on that or is this - or these are situations where sort of no discussions have started?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Yes Charles, I mean we knew we are headed into a very uncertain and unclear environment. I mean it's a pandemic and it's healthcare and we saw the utilization suppression. We knew that whatever the numbers are, we knew that we were benefiting or at least our P&L temporarily is benefiting materially by suppressed utilization. So yes, we expected our state customers to contact the industry, to figure out a way to recoup some of those funds, which is entirely almost the embodiment of actuarial soundness. The rates were super adequate for the COVID declared emergency period and therefore the money should be given back. So, this environment was entirely contemplated. Now at the beginning of the quarter, did I know that healthcare costs will be down between $190 million and $240 million? No. But when utilization was down 20% to 40% in healthcare categories representing two thirds of our spend, you knew that there would be some large distortions related to COVID. So yes, we anticipated this environment as the quarter progressed, we certainly monitored it and this is the result we produced. And I'll say it, the reason we gave you those numbers, if we really did want to highlight, and I'll make this comment, that when you take all the distortions, significant distortions related to COVID out of our numbers, it's a very, very strong quarter with good metrics. I mean, if you take out the $1.10 to $1.65 estimate of what COVID, increased our earnings per share by, we produced at a minimum $3 per share for the quarter, maybe as high as $3.55 for the quarter and that 82% MCR that we printed for the quarter had 400 basis points of COVID benefit in it, so banks were on our 86% result that we've been consistently and routinely producing. So we try to be clear. We try to separate and isolate those COVID distortions as clear as we could. And yes, we knew we were going through an unclear environment which is one of the reasons why we again gave cautious guidance for the back half of the year. Tell us where the pandemic is going and we'll give you a clearer picture, but the range of outcomes for the second half of the year is so varied and so wide, holding our guidance and giving you some qualitative factors rather than quantitative factors, we thought was the most responsible approach.\nCharles Rhyee: I know you are having discussions with states like Texas, Washington, Florida, are those - are those when you kind of mentioned them, are they ones that they're just kind of outstanding, but nothing has really started?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Texas and Washington have asked all - have actually expressed their interest in increasing Medicaid spending during this period of time. We had some early on, I think it was even in the first quarter, Washington as you know was one of the first state to get hit with the pandemic, and a lot of the behavioral providers in Washington who were on fee-for-service, were really, really getting crushed. And so, the state asked us, asked the industry to make some directed payments to providers which we gladly did. So, we're having discussions, that's just an example, we're having discussions with all our states, but Washington and Texas, yet have expressed more interest in infusing more money into Medicaid than extracting it from Medicaid.\nCharles Rhyee: That's helpful. And one last just to clarify, you said additional FMAP could offset further rate headwinds or are you assuming anything above the 6% FMAP in the guidance, either for this year or when you think about next year?\nJoseph Zubretsky: No. As you know, there is all kinds of jousting that's going on between the - in Congress related to this. But no, we did not, whether it's 12%, whether it ends up being 12% or 14%, we did not include any of that outlook as potential upside to what might happen in rates. If it happens, it would be great. I think states will be relieved and I think it will take a lot of pressure off, but no, we did not assume, we did not assume that would happen.\nCharles Rhyee: Great, thanks a lot.\nOperator: The next question comes from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Raskin: Hi, thanks, good morning. I appreciate you taking the question. I apologize for coming back to this voluntary actions or this correcting imbalances, but I just want to understand this in the context of Molina overall. Right? So if you're trying to sort of keep things flat, let's call it on the medical cost side. Right? So, a lot of it gets tripped from a regulatory perspective, but you're going to kind of, it sounds like give back any upside on the medical cost side as a result of COVID, but the enterprise has other headwinds. Right? Higher G&A cost and investment income coming in lower, et cetera. So, I'm just trying to understand, there's a confirmation of guidance, it sounds like none of that upside is on the medical cost side, but you've got other costs. I'm just trying to understand sort of how you think about progressing through the year? Should we just think of, if there is any potential upside, again it gets absorbed and the guidance is the guidance or is there some variability? And is it crazy to think additional costs on the G&A side or lower investment income could actually be a headwind?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Josh, you certainly captured the essence of the difficulty of providing a point estimate forecast in this environment. And, I want to make sure it's clear what we meant. If a refund is enacted, the state is therefore recouping what they considered to be the excess capitation rate through an enacted temporary rate refund. If it triggers a minimum MLR, then there is already an existing regulatory mechanism. And all we are saying is, if we still felt there was a financial imbalance, we feel that imbalance should be corrected. I'm not defining what an imbalance means, whether it's 100 basis points or 200 to 300, it's going to be state-by-state, situation-by-situation. I'm not going to go into exactly what we mean by that. But I do think, as a philosophy, our Company and I think Managed Care generally is taking the approach that we do not intend to benefit by the suppression or the curtailment of utilization due to a global pandemic. Yes, I mean we contemplated the headwind, Tom spoke to it. We contemplated the investment income headwind going into the back half of the year. We contemplated that we would be spending extra G&A as we gave you our cautious approaches. So, it's a no. I wouldn't say they're headwinds. They were already contemplated in our comfort level in re-establishing the guidance we previously gave.\nJoshua Raskin: Okay. And I don't think anyone is going to argue with the strategic value of working with your partners in a period where you benefit, so I think that's an obvious one. Just one quick followup on the development or sort of the lack thereof and sort of how that compares to last year, were there any - typically you guys have seen conservative reporting over the last couple of years, the reserving, I'm sorry. And that's favorable development, sort of the lack thereof. This year, were there some countervailing forces? Was there something else in there? I heard Tom say same methodology, et cetera.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Hey Tom, would you like to take Josh's question about development? Please.\nThomas Tran: Yes, thanks Joe. You're right, Josh. Our reserve methodology remained the same. We said that four to six months that the development is negligible on a PPD basis is slightly favorable, but it's not material. That's why we don't want to call it out.\nJoshua Raskin: Okay. But any - historically you had been seeing more, was there - I guess, is it just getting better at the estimation process or curious why you wouldn't see the same level of development if the methodology is the same.\nThomas Tran: Yes, I would say that - I would say that within anything you do related to reserve, there's always judgment factor, there is range, and you can always argue you come pretty close to it. In prior years, we had a lot more development in that we tended to be a lot more cautious. We still are very conservative in our reserve methodology. So I wouldn't say there is anything inherently different. It's just the outcome is a little bit closer to our estimate.\nJoshua Raskin: Perfect.\nOperator: The next question comes from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Good morning, guys and thanks for taking the question. You guys have clearly positioned the balance sheet and the kind of the debt covenants to be active in the M&A market and you guys are performing well. I guess what I'm interested in hearing about is the other side of the discussions, do you feel like the current environment is giving kind of the smaller plans more breathing room and more room to run and set themselves up for growth or do you feel like this is accelerating M&A discussions?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Hi George, it's Joe. I think COVID has not, in our opinion, changed the attitude of how people think about Managed Care or Managed Medicaid. It's a tough business, it's hard, you have to have the infrastructure, you have to have the scale, you have to have deep skills and knowledge, a lot of esoteric knowledge. It's not, it shouldn't be hobby and it shouldn't be an adjunct. You need to be highly skilled in this. So, no, it hasn't caused us to think any differently about it. Although, I would say that a small Medicaid plan somewhere, might be enjoying some additional profitability. It certainly hasn't changed and the discussions we've had with many plans across the country, it certainly hasn't emboldened them to think differently about the long-term nature of this business. I mean - if it takes a pandemic to put you on the right course to profitability, then you're making the wrong call. So no, we still have a really, really bullish outlook on small discrete bolt-on and tuck-in acquisitions.\nGeorge Hill: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Fidel of Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi thanks, good morning. Joe, first question just interested. I know that obviously there is a lot of moving pieces here, but when thinking about the three segments and the guidance that you had previously given for after-tax margins across the segments, maybe even directionally, can you help us think about in the current guidance, how each of those business lines may have evolved, whether tax [ph] is a little bit lower and Medicaid's a little bit higher or just interested in your thoughts around the three segments in terms of after-tax margins in the 2020 guidance?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Sure. Well, certainly Scott, this thing this wouldn't be the quarter with all of the distortions caused by COVID, this would be the quarter to reset your long-term expectations on margin attainability in any line of business. There's just way too many distorted impacts and you think you have those distorted impacts captured appropriately. And I think we do. But no, I think we still think that Medicaid is a 3% - 4% contributor. We've been routinely producing mid to high single digits in Medicaid \u2013 Medicare. And I would say the one where we still have a desire and a hope and a strategy to drive growth in the Marketplace business at mid-to-high single-digit margins as a growth engine for the business is still in our long-term strategy, but this wouldn't be the quarter to sort of reset your expectations, and I would just answer the question that way.\nScott Fidel: Yes, I understood. And then just a followup, I had a followup question, just on MCC, and how you had laid out when you announced the deal the thoughts on accretion and just interested, if you look at MCC and with Magellan's reporting for them, they've had a big first half. They've already exceeded their full year segment profit guidance just in the first half, but obviously there was a lot of benefit in the second quarter from COVID, just like other health plans. So just interested whether you think that initial first year target of the $0.50 to $0.75 of cash EPS accretion, in your view is that still the right way to think about it or do you think that just given general trajectory that Magellan has had in improving MCC recently, that you can end up capturing a bit more of that multi-year accretion in the first year?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Well, we're always pretty cautious forecasters. So I would say that there is a fair bit of caution built in to the $0.50- $0.75 to begin with on a cash EPS basis. And yes, I mean I obviously can't comment on anything I know through the integration process, but I certainly can respond to your comment on what was reported publicly. And yes, the first half, it looked like the businesses we're doing very, very well and you hit the question, how much of its COVID related and how much of it is sustainable. But certainly, we're pleased with what we saw in the public report and it certainly gives you as much or even more confidence that the accretion numbers we put out there are attainable.\nScott Fidel: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes, hi, good morning. A question on Magellan and Passport. Magellan is in the guidance, Passport is not, what's the rationale for that?\nJoseph Zubretsky: The rationale is, we did not feel it appropriate. We want to be deferential to our regulator customer in the state of Kentucky. We're buying the Passport brand and the assets, but the membership actually needs to be assigned to us. If we get more than 140,000, we projected we get about 140,000 in an auto-assignment process, which I think is a reasonable estimate. But, we do not want to be presumptuous that we would get all or most of the 350,000 and we're trying to be differential to the regulatory approval process. And the Magellan acquisition still needs regulatory approval. Once it's approved and we take over the legal entities, we will have the membership lock, stock and barrel. That was the reason.\nRicky Goldwasser: Okay. And then just on the bolt-on acquisition, I understand you're bullish on the opportunities there. But just going back to one of the earlier comments, so a bolt-on acquisition, I think you referred to as sort of part of organic growth. So should we assume that they are included in the guidance?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Well, it's an interesting question. I believe in a quasi organic way, if you want to point of term, that anything done with generated cash flow is as good as organic, particularly with the prices we're paying. When you can - when you can recover the purchase price of an acquisition in the first year of positive cash flow at a purchase price of what is likely to be somewhere around 12% of premium, that's as good as organic, even though it's technically an inorganic play in the case of Passport. So to me, if you're buying bolt-on tuck-in acquisitions particularly membership migrations where you're paying per member or for the members retained, even though you're outweighing a modest amount of capital, it's just good as organic.\nRicky Goldwasser: Got it and then lastly, when we think about the new Medicaid members that are on-boarding. How do you see stuff like that margin profile concurred to existing population?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Since many of them are coming either through or staying on through the redetermination process, the way I would describe it is, those members are an average acuity of our existing population, not materially more acute, not materially less acute. Now when the unemployment surge happens, I think you might get a slightly different story, since people that need healthcare generally seek it. So you could have a slight acuity shift there, which is one of the reasons why when we gave our guidance with, A, we don't know how many members were getting and B, we don't know their level of acuity or the cost of service. So it's clearly just another factor of uncertainty for the back half of the year.\nRicky Goldwasser: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sarah James of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nSarah James: Thank you. Can you walk us through how pricing actions would have impacted the Hicks [ph] margins ex-COVID and what long-term margins are, what your goals are for that product? And then the comment, I just wanted to clarify your comment on risk scores being off from what you expected. How much of that is really related to industry trends or challenges because of COVID in getting new members evaluated and scored versus the population that Molina holds having a difference in the health of the population? Thanks.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Sure. I'm going to answer your last question first and ask you to repeat the first one, I'm not sure I understood it. But, we clearly think this is a case where the new bronze membership we took on, we did not either have or get quickly enough the risk scores that we needed to service that population. And there could be just a lag by when you get all your coding done, when you get all your interventions done, we'll catch it up. We have a very good operation when it comes to risk scoring, so was the churn in that bronze population that caused us to have risk scores that lag. It will catch up and it's not a long-term concern. I think I need for you to repeat the first part of your question, it was about medical - it was about Marketplace rates, but I didn't follow it.\nSarah James: Yes, so I just wanted to understand with the Marketplace margins, I mean in some of the change there was the pricing actions and some was related to COVID. So just trying to understand ex-COVID, how do you think margins would have ended up, given your pricing actions? And how do you think about your margin goals for that product, long-term?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Okay. We haven't changed our margin outlook for the product and we still have a strategy of growing the profit pool. And as I've said many times, on a year-by-year basis, me and my management team will make the call on whether we ease up on margin to grow membership or whether we pull back, ease up on membership to grow margin and we'll make that decision, geography by geography with a thorough analysis of the competitive landscape. With respect to the performance of the business, the COVID pandemic utilization curtailment did not have as significant impact on Marketplace as it did on other businesses. Initially, utilization was down in late March and early April, but it bounced back very, very quickly through May and June. So, it did not have as steep an impact on Marketplace as it did on Medicare and Medicaid.\nSarah James: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is a followup from Stephen Tanal of SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.\nStephen Tanal: Hey guys, thanks for taking this and sorry to come back on. I guess, I just in part wanted to clarify a point I made that I think is now wrong. I hadn't factored in Puerto Rico when I looked at organic growth, and so I just wanted to walk through the math of the bridge to '21 revenue. So if you have $17.8 billion of premium revenue in '20 and $21.5 billion in '21, obviously there is a $3.7 billion increase. Magellan Complete Care good for $2.8 billion. YourCare steps up $100 million and then you've divested Puerto Rico, which is $400 million. So I'd call all of those non-organic and so M&A seems to be contributing about $2.5 billion which implies about $1.2 billion net organic, which I think is organic growth of about 6.6%, which still, is a little bit conservative. But I just wanted to say is that math right and is that kind of how you guys are thinking about it or is there anything else you'd want to steer us there?\nJoseph Zubretsky: You have the right model in your thinking. That is the model we've used, and again it's an outlook. It's not a pinpoint estimate. We believe, not believe, we couched it as conservative. We wanted to give you and our investors a very clear indication of where the trajectory of our top line is going. We will refine this estimate as we go forward, when we go through the third and fourth quarters. Who knows where our Medicaid membership will be, we could have another 150,000 members by the end of next quarter. We just don't know. So we will refine the organic aspects of this, but the inorganic aspects are pretty clear. And you're right, you have to factor in the $400 million Puerto Rico exit as an offset to some modestly calibrated organic growth.\nStephen Tanal: Yes, I missed that. And I guess just lastly, when might we learn about Kentucky and whether they're going to let you keep Passport's enrollment?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Well there is - I don't want to comment on the regulatory process, but we're working through the regulatory process on the contract novation and on the after the process of getting approval to buy the Passport infrastructure. Open enrollment starts, I think it's mid-October. So we're hoping to have this whole thing included either by the end of the summer or early in September, but I can't predict when that will actually happen. But we're working hard on it and the earlier it can get done, the more stable that membership will be. Those members love the Passport brand. They like being in that plan. The state understands that. So I think we're all aligned in our intention to want to keep those members in the Passport brand, in the Passport care plan and in the Passport network.\nStephen Tanal: Great, thank you, again, I appreciate it.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joseph Zubretsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Julie, and good morning. Today, we would like to provide you with updates on a number of topics. First, we will cover the enterprise-wide financial results for the second quarter; second and relatedly, we will discuss the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on various aspects of our business; third, we will convey our guidance in the context of our second quarter results and this new but temporary operating environment; and fourth and lastly, we will provide a premium revenue growth outlook for 2021 which is approximately 20% as we now emerge from pivoting to growth to activating our growth phase. Let me start with specific second quarter highlights. Last night we reported earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $4.65 with net income of $276 million. These results were supported by an MCR of 82.3%, a G&A ratio of 7.5% and an after tax margin of 6%. Our year-to-date earnings per diluted share is now $7.54 representing 66% of our full-year guidance. The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on many aspects of our quarterly results. Some of these impacts increased earnings while others served to decrease earnings. While many of these impacts are known and estimable, others require significant judgment to estimate. Today, we will do our best to quantify the COVID impacts on our results and separate them from the underlying core earnings power of the business. In doing so, two things are clear. Our operating metrics were substantially in line with our expectations, both as reported and as adjusted for COVID impacts and both our core earnings and the growth trajectory of our business have not been disrupted by the short-term impacts of COVID. We estimate that taken together all COVID impacts on our financial results for the quarter resulted in an increase in net income in a range of $65 million to $100 million, equating to an increase in earnings per diluted share in a range of $1.10 to $1.65. Now I will provide some highlights related to our second quarter results from an enterprise perspective. Beginning with revenue, our premium revenues of $4.1 billion increased by 8% over the prior year. Relatedly, our membership increased sequentially by 151,000 members or 4% primarily in Medicaid. With respect to medical costs with an 82.3% MCR our performance was also strong, although significantly augmented by COVID impacts. Although in many cases we were required to relax our utilization management and payment integrity regimes as an accommodation to providers. We continue to effectively manage medical costs while ensuring all of our members receive high-quality care. This MCR result was impacted by two directionally different factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We experienced lower than expected medical costs due to COVID related utilization curtailment, a phenomenon that may or may not recur during the balance of the year and a number of our state Medicaid customers enacted retroactive rate refunds. In the quarter the lower medical costs and the retroactive rate refunds combined to reduce our reported medical care ratio by an estimated 300 to 400 basis points, which account for substantially all of the reduction in the ratio both year-over-year and sequentially. All of the COVID impacts on our second quarter results will be describe in more detail in a few moments. Next, we continued to effectively manage our administrative costs through productivity gains and fixed cost leverage, producing a G&A ratio of 7.5%. This is despite spending on specific COVID related items, which temporarily increased our administrative spending. Our net investment income usually not in earnings item with significant variability was again unusually low at $18 million compared to $34 million a year ago due to the current low interest rate environment. Our line of business results were very much in line with our expectations with strong metrics in both Medicaid and Medicare, while our marketplace results were slightly lower than expected due to a higher than expected member acuity mix. Finally in the quarter, we continued to improve our capital structure. We issued $800 million of high-yield bonds used to retire short-term floating rate debt. We also upsized our revolver to $1 billion from its previous level of $500 million. These are more than mere transactions. They are the culmination of a two-year long and highly successful restructuring and optimization of our capital structure. We are now positioned with well priced debt, nicely lathered [ph] maturities, solid credit metrics and ample dry powder to execute on M&A opportunities if and when those opportunities arise. In summary, we continued to perform well across the many fundamentals of managed care, which has been our hallmark and we are continuing to grow revenue as a result of our focus on topline growth. Now, I will provide some commentary about the effects of COVID on our second quarter results. The COVID impacts on our quarterly results include, a decrease in medical costs due to COVID related utilization curtailment, offset by direct care related to COVID patients. Retroactive rate refunds to a number of our state Medicaid customers, an increase in our G&A spending on activities related to COVID and a meaningful increase to our Medicaid membership. As previously mentioned, we estimate that taken together all COVID impacts on our financial results for the quarter, have produced an increase in net income in a range of approximately $65 million to $100 million, equating to an increase in earnings per diluted share in a range of $1.10 to $1.65. I will now provide more color on the most significant factors contributing to this. With respect to the COVID impacts on medical costs, early in the quarter we experienced significantly lower utilization in a variety of cost categories, categories representing approximately two thirds of our total spend with utilization levels increasing slowly as the quarter progressed. By the end of the quarter, utilization in these categories were still approximately 10% lower than we would have normally expected. The medical cost categories most impacted were elective surgeries, services in ambulatory settings, ER visits, behavioral services and wellness and preventive services. We also incurred a direct cost to care for COVID patients with just over 4100 hospitalizations and average inpatient episode cost of $9000 plus the cost of outpatient and other professional services. The cost per COVID episode varies widely depending on the acuity of the patient. We estimate that COVID lowered our second quarter medical costs by $190 million to $240 million. As you know, as a general matter, there are fewer elective procedures performed under the Medicaid program than is the case with commercial health insurance. Since our book of business is heavily weighted to Medicaid, the effect on us of elective procedure curtailment is therefore less pronounced. Six of our state customers enacted temporary retroactive rate refunds during the quarter, with the intent of recouping the portion of our capitated rates not spent on healthcare services due to the pandemic. In the quarter these refunds amounted to $75 million pretax and related to the states of Ohio, Illinois, California, South Carolina, Mississippi, and Washington. Some items of note. The refunds in these states took various forms ranging from simple rate adjustment to a slightly more complex risk sharing [indiscernible] around a target medical loss ratio, as well as supplemental payments to providers. In many of our states however, it was business as usual as we continued to operate on the pre-COVID rate structure. Our position on rate adequacy has been consistent. We do not intend, nor do we want to keep state Medicaid money that was intended to be spent on medical benefits or was not due to utilization curtailment caused by COVID. In many of our Medicaid states, there are already mechanisms in place to protect against a surplus margin as there are minimum MLRs in seven of our states and profit caps in two others. The FMAP increase and potential additional FMAP increases should significantly relieve any potential rate pressure in our states and CMS has authority to approve or disapprove proposed rate actions that are not aligned with the definition of actuarial soundness. Once the COVID pandemic abates, we believe that the traditional process of establishing prospective actuarial sound rates based on a credible medical cost baseline and cost trend of that baseline will continue. With respect to our G&A expenses, COVID related activity increased our second quarter expenses by approximately $25 million. A variety of new operational protocols, technology implementations, and benefits for our employees, all related to the COVID pandemic were established or implemented during the quarter. In addition, we have consciously managed our headcount at above optimal levels to ensure we maintain adequate service levels, but also to be socially responsible to our dedicated staff. Medicaid membership increased sequentially by 152,000 members in the quarter, a 5% increase. Much of this was due to the suspension of redeterminations as we believe that unemployment related enrollment has not yet materially accessed managed Medicaid. It remains unclear how high the membership peak will be, how quickly it will be attained, how quickly it will fall as the economy recovers and where it will ultimately settle. We have invested in many local growth initiatives with providers in branding and awareness campaigns and in social media outreach to ensure we obtain our fair share of increased membership. We believe that post COVID Medicaid membership will stabilize at and increased level as the future natural unemployment rate will likely be higher than previously experienced. In summary, as we work through this unprecedented period, we remain focused on executing on the underlying fundamentals of our business regardless of the short term COVID related impacts on our reported financial results. Now I'll turn to our guidance for the full year. Our full year earnings guidance range remains at $11.20 to $11.70 per diluted share with a midpoint of $11.45. Our earnings per share EBITDA [ph] is $7.54, which means through six months we have earned 66% of our revised guidance. Given the environmental uncertainty that we expect to exist through the end of the year, we are not adjusting the range of our previously provided earnings per share guidance. We intend to adjust our full year outlook as appropriate when our third quarter results are reported. The reasons for this cautious approach have always been stated, but bear repeating. The near-term outlook for medical costs, the cost of COVID and the potential elective procedure rebound, are unknown at this time. There is still potential for additional near-term rate actions or voluntary company concessions to customers, members and providers. We will fulfill our obligation to make any rebate to member, CMS or our state customers related to the statutory requirements that exist today. After doing so, if we conclude that there is still a remaining financial imbalance, we will correct that imbalance. Our membership forecast has a wide range of possible outcomes as there are numerous macroeconomic variables in play and relatedly the acuity of any potential membership increase and the cost of services are also highly variable. And lastly, we believe that any methodology for extrapolating annual earnings estimates by quarter should be suspended in ones thinking. I would now like to turn to the progress we have made in executing our growth strategy, which is having an immediate impact and which allows us to forecast premium revenue growth of approximately 20% for 2021. We have essentially checked the box on at least one initiative across all the revenue growth dimensions outlined in our growth strategy. We have retained all of our existing Medicaid contracts. We have won a new state contract and we have executed meaningful and accretive acquisitions. And with the impact of the recession, organic growth would be much better than expected. Some highlights. Based on announced re-procurement schedules, the revenue associated with our current in-force Medicaid contract should be intact through 2021, plus we have significant certainty related to 2022. The new management team has won or defended all of the re-procurements that were under its control. We assumed the YourCare membership on July 1st which will increase membership by 47,000 members in the third quarter, and should provide approximately $140 million of revenue for the remainder of 2020 and $280 million for the full year 2021. The Magellan Complete Care regulatory review process is proceeding as planned. Recall that the Federal antitrust approval is complete and the state approval processes are progressing. We hope to close the transaction by the end of the year and if we do this acquisition will provide the previously announced $2.8 billion of revenue in 2021. For every month the closing would be delayed beyond the first of the year that annual revenue estimate would decrease proportionately. Our Kentucky RFP win will have contracts start date of January 1, 2021. Before considering any of the potential benefits of the Passport acquisition under a conservative set of membership assignment assumptions, the contract should provide at least $850 of revenue in 2021 with upside potential into 2022 as membership organically builds. Organic same-store membership growth, increased product penetration in our nascent Navajo Nation project would also modestly contribute to the 2021 revenue growth rate. Finally, as previously announced, we're exiting the Medicaid business in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. We have reached an agreement to execute an orderly transition of our members to an on-Island competitor. The unwinding will be completed by November 1, and the impact of the transaction itself and the contract exit are not financially material. Under these assumptions, we project 2021 premium revenue of approximately $21.5 billion. We are very pleased with a 20% increase in premium revenue as we move from pivoting to growth to fully activating our top line growth strategy. Another major development in activating our growth strategy was our recently announced transaction to purchase certain Passport assets. The transaction is expected to close before the end of 2020, providing us with a well known brand in Kentucky, a turnkey operation and the opportunity to gain additional membership. Passport represents potential upside to our 2020 and 2021 revenue guidance. The purchase price for Passport is approximately $20 million plus contingent consideration payable in 2021, based on the level of enrollment retained above a certain threshold. A few words about the Passport transaction and its benefits. We will acquire the Passport brand name, all its operating infrastructure, and we will assume approximately 500 highly trained Kentucky based Passport and Evolent employees. The acquisition allows us to enhance operational readiness in advance of our new contract award in Kentucky, and enables continuity of care for Passport members. The acquisition allows us to avoid startup losses, inevitably associated with building a Greenfield health plan, and the early lack of scale. The acquisition allows us to compete more effectively for additional membership above what we might have ordinarily received from the standard auto assignment process related to our own contract award. And from a financial perspective, we expect to recover the purchase price from positive cash flow in less than one year, as the plan would be immediately profitable and is likely to produce membership well above what we might have achieved organically. It is also important to know that the membership revenue in earnings, related to Passport could all commence and begin to impact our results on or about September 1, if the Commonwealth of Kentucky approves our joint request for an early contract novation. This would be a very positive outcome, although it would impact the year-over-year revenue growth rate calculation. As I conclude my remarks. I take a pause from discussing our operating and financial performance and instead, comment on our compassion or humanity. During this unprecedented time, our company made many significant contributions to charitable, and community causes. We offered financial assistance to distressed providers, and worked with our State customers to understand where they saw human tragedies unfold and offered our financial and operational assistance. We will continue to do so. And in fact, we are developing plans to deepen our social commitment to build stronger communities, one life at a time. I offer another heartfelt thank you to our management team, and our 10,000 associates who are executing well while dealing with their own stresses and issues related to the pandemic and racial strife. Even when facing these challenges, our associates are inspired and motivated by the opportunity to make positive change by delivering high quality healthcare to the disadvantaged. Our associates continue to excel and I stand in admiration of their dedication and their will to sacrifice in the face of all types of adversity. In conclusion, this was a meaningful quarter for the company. Our results met our expectations, despite the turbulence caused by the COVID pandemic. We took major steps forward in our transformation. We sustained our margins, but did right by our members and customers. We fully activated our revenue growth strategy and continued to deploy excess capital in strategic acquisitions. This level of performance provides an insightful glimpse into our very bright future. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for some additional color on the financials. Tom? Sure, Justin this is Joe. We grew membership sequentially in Medicaid by 152,000 members at 5%. We believe with really good information that most of that was the result of the suspension of redetermination; that the unemployment surge that is likely to come to manage Medicaid has not yet occurred due to a variety of reasons, spousal coverage, COBRA and backlogs in the various states. Certainly we expect that membership to be on the books for a while. We know it will hit a peak and we also know that as the economy recovers, it will begin to trip [ph]. We do not yet, we have various forecasts of how much membership we are likely to have at the end of the year as a result of all this. But I think we're comfortable in saying that our Medicaid membership will be higher than previously forecasted as a result of COVID. But we have not put a point estimate on that. It's still way too many variables to put a point estimate on how many members we're likely to get. I will say this, through the first three weeks of July the Medicaid membership continued to grow by about 30,000 members organically in the first three weeks of July. Sure. In our marketplace business, our silver bronze mix didn't change all that much. But we did have a churn in the bronze membership we took on, so we had many new members in our bronze product. The MLR ran higher on those numbers than we had expected. It's either higher medical \u2013 if you are attracting the right risk or it's either mismanagement of your medical cost line, but if you're managing medical costs effectively, which we think we are, then the risk scores just haven't been commensurate. So we'll catch up and we'll get the risk scores in line with the acuity of the membership. But that's the reason for the small shortfall in our marketplace business for the quarter. With respect to the business, yes we projected a medical costs baseline on COVID impacted use 2019 is the medical costs baseline and then trended forward without any COVID impacts. So we believe that the rates we filed for 2021 are solid, fully contemplated all the costs related to medical services for our members, and the scores that we will attain. Well, the retroactive refunds that we record in the quarter really are a reflection of exactly how the rate apparatus should work. Obviously, rates never contemplated this rather dramatic curtailment in utilization. So whether states enact refunds themselves or whether the minimum MLRs in seven of our States get triggered, the money is rightfully going back to the States because it wasn't spent on benefits for their beneficiaries. So we recorded the retroactive component, either back to in some cases back to March in some cases back to the beginning of the year. And certainly we contemplated the forward looking aspects of those rate decreases and refunds, as we provided our very cautious outlook to the balance of the year. So the 75 million was truly the retroactive component that takes us through June 30, but we certainly contemplated the continuation of those refunds that have already been enacted, and obviously the potential for more actions to be enacted by our State customers. That's a fair point. I think I'm going to use that as the opportunity to make sure we clarify the outlook we're giving for premium revenue in 2021. First thing, I would say is, you know, our revised forecast for 2020 is $17.8 billion of premium revenue, which is a 10% increase over 2019. That's a pretty strong pivot. Now as we really activate the growth strategy, projecting a 20% growth rate off of 2020 is certainly something we're pleased with. And yes, it does contemplate the Magellan Complete Care acquisition closing on January 1. For every month it would be delayed you can proportionately reduce that. But we expect it to close at the earliest by the end of the year, but no later than the end of the first quarter. We also included the organic component of our Kentucky contract, meaning an amount of revenue in Kentucky that we estimate we would get through the normal auto assignment process. We did not include any potential benefits of additional membership that we'll get through the ownership of the Passport brand and the potential innovation of that contract early in the fall. Also, it's important to note that we've decided to exit Puerto Rico, which leaves $400 million of revenue in 2019 will not be in the 2020 rate, and, of course, a modest, very modest and cautious forecast of organic growth. So that's sort of how we compiled our rather conservative outlook for 2021 and we really wanted to just begin framing the story as we really activate our growth strategy, we wanted to give a forward look, a leading indicator, an outlook of where our revenue line is headed. Yes. We have various forecasts on where, as I said, in the previous question, I was asked of where the Medicaid membership will go. And, as I said, we're just we're taking it week-by-week. We - membership grew again in the month of July. We expect it to grow again in August and perhaps through September as that unemployment surge comes through. But it's just so really hard to project. The way I would think about it is, is and what I'm holding my team accountable to, we should do no worse than our market share in those markets. Hopefully, we'll gain market share on this process, but if you take our market share, that would be a good proxy for - if Medicaid enrollment grows by a certain percent we should at least get our market share. Sure. Well, Matt, the conversations with our various day customers have been very balanced and very rational. And they do understand the principle that it has the force of federal law of actuarial soundness, which in the CMS approval process they take very seriously as well. Clearly, the actions that have been taken are related to COVID. That's - that has occupied the conversation. We clearly understand that there are other budget pressures in the states that are causing them to look at Medicaid with a very, very sharp pencil. But you can't recruit money in Medicaid rates to balance your budget. That violates the concept of actuarial soundness. The rates have to reflect that the services that we intend to allow members to have and I think the rate environment will persist through all this. As I said, we'll go back to a point where on a prospective basis, we agreed to statistically credible medical cost baseline, a reasonable trend off that baseline. And, the - that has served managed Medicaid well over many, many years. Well, as you know, our rates contract years span from January 1 to July to September. So we're always in some type of discussion with our customers about rates. And, as we emerge through this COVID period, we have to adjust for the effects of COVID. Are the effects of COVID going to last into the 2021 baseline? Right now, they could, but we just don't know. So I wouldn't want to divulge any particular conversation we're having with states, but the discussion about how long COVID will last, and what that medical cost baseline needs to reflect, is just an ongoing state-by-state discussion. Okay, thank you. Your math is precisely correct. We assumed through an auto assignment process that we'd likely get 140,000 members, which is why we put an estimate of $850 million into our forecast. And we just didn't want to be presumptive. We're buying the Passport operating assets and the brand name. The membership has to be assigned to us through the state approval process. But you're absolutely right. If we obtained all 350,000 members that would represent a little over a $1 billion of upside to the $21.5 billion estimate that we've given you. I will say this, while we're still in the approval process, so I don't want to go into any particular conversations we've had, continuity of care is really, really important to our customers, stability of the network, continuity of the care plans, particularly for the high acuity population is really, really important to our customer. So we believe what one of the potentials for this transaction is to keep either all or many of the 350,000 members that are now in the Passport plan. That was certainly the intention that we had in mind when we bought the Passport assets. So, continuity of care, really, really important to the customer and stability of network, and if we are able to keep many of those members, those objectives will have been met. We continue to believe that we'll grow our marketplace product. Our DSNP product is doing really, really well. We clearly have plans to grow market share, as I outlined at are Investor Day over a year ago, putting in the operational protocols to make sure that we have less leakage on redetermination than we've had in the past, and that through additional branding and awareness campaigns at the local level, we attract more membership through the voluntary process. Improving our risk scores and our quality scores I should say, to move up higher in the auto assignment algorithms. So we have plans to grow organically. I would call it small bolt-on acquisitions as good as organic, particularly at the prices we're paying. So, I'd stay at the cautious and conservative estimate, and that's the way I would think about it. Now, after we recorded the premium refunds, the minimum MLRs did not have any impact in the quarter, no material impact on our financial results. Now going forward, again depends where COVID takes the medical cost line. It depends where the retroactive rate refunds kick-in. But we, again through whatever mechanism there is, we actually prefer and intend to make sure that we don't keep state money that was paid to us for servicing members that wasn't due to the pandemic. So whether it's through the retroactive rate refund, whether it's through the minimum MLR mechanism or whether it's just voluntary, working with our state customer to make directed payments to providers to add value added benefits for members or just to give them the money back, we think that's the responsible way to behave in a global pandemic with our Medicaid customers. I would say that the states of - the states that haven't yet, are Washington - Washington have directed payments, but no, Washington and Texas, no. Florida and Michigan, have not. New York hasn't. So, those are the states, Wisconsin hasn't. Those are the states that haven't yet, and I don't have the list in front of me of where the MLRs are, but the MLRs are 85 or 86 and those could get tripped and probably in a marginal way, but those are the states that haven't enacted anything yet. And as I said, we'll wait and see, when something's enacted, how they're enacted, what retro period they apply to, et cetera. But that's the, that's the outlook. Well, certainly we have, we follow very, very closely all of the budget and legislative activity with our state customers. Obviously, it gives you a sense of hope, repeat their budgets are with tax revenues or not, so we certainly follow it. Many of our states have already passed budgets, many of them passed budgets a year ago that are two years in duration, where we haven't had any conversations about rates. But many are in the process. Certain of them are in process. So we certainly keep our eye on it, but as I said before, you can't use Medicaid rates to recoup tax revenues. They have to reflect the services that you intend to pay for members. And as I said on the last earnings call, there is no question that as the economy moves up and down and state budgets are either very strong or on the weaker side, then rates would be on the stronger side of actuarial soundness when the economy is really robust, and might be on the weaker side of actuarial soundness when the economy is flat. And again, there is the offsetting impact of more membership or fewer members. So, it modulates and it's all manageable. But as I said, actuarial soundness has to reflect the cost of healthcare services for your members and you can't recoup budget deficits with Medicaid money. It certainly was contemplated in the very cautious outlook we gave for the second half. I would state it this way. A state might decide that they will take the action to recoup the money that wasn't paid in benefits through these rate refunds. If they don't do that and we trigger a minimum MLR, then we have to pay it back by regulation. If neither of those two things exist or happen and we still think that we inappropriately or inadvertently, unexpectedly benefited by this curtailment of utilization, we would work with our state customer and work on a program of either additional value added benefits for members, directed payments to stressed or distressed providers or just give them the money back. We just don't think it's helpful for the Managed Care industry to sort of have a surplus margin related to curtailed utilization in a pandemic and we'll report that as we report our third and fourth quarters, we will report to the extent we trigger minimum MLRs, we have retroactive rate refunds where we voluntarily granted money back to our customer. Yes Charles, I mean we knew we are headed into a very uncertain and unclear environment. I mean it's a pandemic and it's healthcare and we saw the utilization suppression. We knew that whatever the numbers are, we knew that we were benefiting or at least our P&L temporarily is benefiting materially by suppressed utilization. So yes, we expected our state customers to contact the industry, to figure out a way to recoup some of those funds, which is entirely almost the embodiment of actuarial soundness. The rates were super adequate for the COVID declared emergency period and therefore the money should be given back. So, this environment was entirely contemplated. Now at the beginning of the quarter, did I know that healthcare costs will be down between $190 million and $240 million? No. But when utilization was down 20% to 40% in healthcare categories representing two thirds of our spend, you knew that there would be some large distortions related to COVID. So yes, we anticipated this environment as the quarter progressed, we certainly monitored it and this is the result we produced. And I'll say it, the reason we gave you those numbers, if we really did want to highlight, and I'll make this comment, that when you take all the distortions, significant distortions related to COVID out of our numbers, it's a very, very strong quarter with good metrics. I mean, if you take out the $1.10 to $1.65 estimate of what COVID, increased our earnings per share by, we produced at a minimum $3 per share for the quarter, maybe as high as $3.55 for the quarter and that 82% MCR that we printed for the quarter had 400 basis points of COVID benefit in it, so banks were on our 86% result that we've been consistently and routinely producing. So we try to be clear. We try to separate and isolate those COVID distortions as clear as we could. And yes, we knew we were going through an unclear environment which is one of the reasons why we again gave cautious guidance for the back half of the year. Tell us where the pandemic is going and we'll give you a clearer picture, but the range of outcomes for the second half of the year is so varied and so wide, holding our guidance and giving you some qualitative factors rather than quantitative factors, we thought was the most responsible approach. Texas and Washington have asked all - have actually expressed their interest in increasing Medicaid spending during this period of time. We had some early on, I think it was even in the first quarter, Washington as you know was one of the first state to get hit with the pandemic, and a lot of the behavioral providers in Washington who were on fee-for-service, were really, really getting crushed. And so, the state asked us, asked the industry to make some directed payments to providers which we gladly did. So, we're having discussions, that's just an example, we're having discussions with all our states, but Washington and Texas, yet have expressed more interest in infusing more money into Medicaid than extracting it from Medicaid. No. As you know, there is all kinds of jousting that's going on between the - in Congress related to this. But no, we did not, whether it's 12%, whether it ends up being 12% or 14%, we did not include any of that outlook as potential upside to what might happen in rates. If it happens, it would be great. I think states will be relieved and I think it will take a lot of pressure off, but no, we did not assume, we did not assume that would happen. Josh, you certainly captured the essence of the difficulty of providing a point estimate forecast in this environment. And, I want to make sure it's clear what we meant. If a refund is enacted, the state is therefore recouping what they considered to be the excess capitation rate through an enacted temporary rate refund. If it triggers a minimum MLR, then there is already an existing regulatory mechanism. And all we are saying is, if we still felt there was a financial imbalance, we feel that imbalance should be corrected. I'm not defining what an imbalance means, whether it's 100 basis points or 200 to 300, it's going to be state-by-state, situation-by-situation. I'm not going to go into exactly what we mean by that. But I do think, as a philosophy, our Company and I think Managed Care generally is taking the approach that we do not intend to benefit by the suppression or the curtailment of utilization due to a global pandemic. Yes, I mean we contemplated the headwind, Tom spoke to it. We contemplated the investment income headwind going into the back half of the year. We contemplated that we would be spending extra G&A as we gave you our cautious approaches. So, it's a no. I wouldn't say they're headwinds. They were already contemplated in our comfort level in re-establishing the guidance we previously gave. Hey Tom, would you like to take Josh's question about development? Please. Hi George, it's Joe. I think COVID has not, in our opinion, changed the attitude of how people think about Managed Care or Managed Medicaid. It's a tough business, it's hard, you have to have the infrastructure, you have to have the scale, you have to have deep skills and knowledge, a lot of esoteric knowledge. It's not, it shouldn't be hobby and it shouldn't be an adjunct. You need to be highly skilled in this. So, no, it hasn't caused us to think any differently about it. Although, I would say that a small Medicaid plan somewhere, might be enjoying some additional profitability. It certainly hasn't changed and the discussions we've had with many plans across the country, it certainly hasn't emboldened them to think differently about the long-term nature of this business. I mean - if it takes a pandemic to put you on the right course to profitability, then you're making the wrong call. So no, we still have a really, really bullish outlook on small discrete bolt-on and tuck-in acquisitions. Sure. Well, certainly Scott, this thing this wouldn't be the quarter with all of the distortions caused by COVID, this would be the quarter to reset your long-term expectations on margin attainability in any line of business. There's just way too many distorted impacts and you think you have those distorted impacts captured appropriately. And I think we do. But no, I think we still think that Medicaid is a 3% - 4% contributor. We've been routinely producing mid to high single digits in Medicaid \u2013 Medicare. And I would say the one where we still have a desire and a hope and a strategy to drive growth in the Marketplace business at mid-to-high single-digit margins as a growth engine for the business is still in our long-term strategy, but this wouldn't be the quarter to sort of reset your expectations, and I would just answer the question that way. Well, we're always pretty cautious forecasters. So I would say that there is a fair bit of caution built in to the $0.50- $0.75 to begin with on a cash EPS basis. And yes, I mean I obviously can't comment on anything I know through the integration process, but I certainly can respond to your comment on what was reported publicly. And yes, the first half, it looked like the businesses we're doing very, very well and you hit the question, how much of its COVID related and how much of it is sustainable. But certainly, we're pleased with what we saw in the public report and it certainly gives you as much or even more confidence that the accretion numbers we put out there are attainable. The rationale is, we did not feel it appropriate. We want to be deferential to our regulator customer in the state of Kentucky. We're buying the Passport brand and the assets, but the membership actually needs to be assigned to us. If we get more than 140,000, we projected we get about 140,000 in an auto-assignment process, which I think is a reasonable estimate. But, we do not want to be presumptuous that we would get all or most of the 350,000 and we're trying to be differential to the regulatory approval process. And the Magellan acquisition still needs regulatory approval. Once it's approved and we take over the legal entities, we will have the membership lock, stock and barrel. That was the reason. Well, it's an interesting question. I believe in a quasi organic way, if you want to point of term, that anything done with generated cash flow is as good as organic, particularly with the prices we're paying. When you can - when you can recover the purchase price of an acquisition in the first year of positive cash flow at a purchase price of what is likely to be somewhere around 12% of premium, that's as good as organic, even though it's technically an inorganic play in the case of Passport. So to me, if you're buying bolt-on tuck-in acquisitions particularly membership migrations where you're paying per member or for the members retained, even though you're outweighing a modest amount of capital, it's just good as organic. Since many of them are coming either through or staying on through the redetermination process, the way I would describe it is, those members are an average acuity of our existing population, not materially more acute, not materially less acute. Now when the unemployment surge happens, I think you might get a slightly different story, since people that need healthcare generally seek it. So you could have a slight acuity shift there, which is one of the reasons why when we gave our guidance with, A, we don't know how many members were getting and B, we don't know their level of acuity or the cost of service. So it's clearly just another factor of uncertainty for the back half of the year. Sure. I'm going to answer your last question first and ask you to repeat the first one, I'm not sure I understood it. But, we clearly think this is a case where the new bronze membership we took on, we did not either have or get quickly enough the risk scores that we needed to service that population. And there could be just a lag by when you get all your coding done, when you get all your interventions done, we'll catch it up. We have a very good operation when it comes to risk scoring, so was the churn in that bronze population that caused us to have risk scores that lag. It will catch up and it's not a long-term concern. I think I need for you to repeat the first part of your question, it was about medical - it was about Marketplace rates, but I didn't follow it. Okay. We haven't changed our margin outlook for the product and we still have a strategy of growing the profit pool. And as I've said many times, on a year-by-year basis, me and my management team will make the call on whether we ease up on margin to grow membership or whether we pull back, ease up on membership to grow margin and we'll make that decision, geography by geography with a thorough analysis of the competitive landscape. With respect to the performance of the business, the COVID pandemic utilization curtailment did not have as significant impact on Marketplace as it did on other businesses. Initially, utilization was down in late March and early April, but it bounced back very, very quickly through May and June. So, it did not have as steep an impact on Marketplace as it did on Medicare and Medicaid. You have the right model in your thinking. That is the model we've used, and again it's an outlook. It's not a pinpoint estimate. We believe, not believe, we couched it as conservative. We wanted to give you and our investors a very clear indication of where the trajectory of our top line is going. We will refine this estimate as we go forward, when we go through the third and fourth quarters. Who knows where our Medicaid membership will be, we could have another 150,000 members by the end of next quarter. We just don't know. So we will refine the organic aspects of this, but the inorganic aspects are pretty clear. And you're right, you have to factor in the $400 million Puerto Rico exit as an offset to some modestly calibrated organic growth. Well there is - I don't want to comment on the regulatory process, but we're working through the regulatory process on the contract novation and on the after the process of getting approval to buy the Passport infrastructure. Open enrollment starts, I think it's mid-October. So we're hoping to have this whole thing included either by the end of the summer or early in September, but I can't predict when that will actually happen. But we're working hard on it and the earlier it can get done, the more stable that membership will be. Those members love the Passport brand. They like being in that plan. The state understands that. So I think we're all aligned in our intention to want to keep those members in the Passport brand, in the Passport care plan and in the Passport network."

            "name": "Thomas Tran",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe and good morning. First, I will comment on our balance sheet, cash flow, and capital. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and reserve positions remain strong. Days in claim payable represent 52 days of medical cost expense, compared to 49 days in the first quarter of 2020, and 48 days in the second quarter of 2019. The sequential increase was driven by lower medical expense in the current quarter, due to the impact of COVID. Reserved development for the first six months of 2020 was negligible compared to favorable development, which decreased our MCR by 110 basis points in the comparable period in 2019. Operating cash flow for the second quarter of 2020 were $630 million, reflecting the strong operating result, and the timing of government receipts and payments. We attract $185 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, which brought our parent company cash balance to $1.2 billion, and give us ample flexibility to fund our recent acquisitions and organic growth initiatives. Debt at the end of the quarter is nearly 1.6 times trolling per month EBITDA. Our leverage ratio is 60.7%. However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, the leverage ratio is only 30.7%. Taken together, these metrics reflect a conservative leveraged position. Our $800 million high yield offering was priced at 4 and 3.8%, indicating that the debt markets view our credit quality at a level that should provide a path for a ratings upgrade in the near future. As of June 30, 2020, our health plans at total statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2.1 billion, which equates to approximately 350% of risk based capital. Now turning to our 2020 guidance. Our full year's earnings guidance range is $11.20 to $11.70 per diluted share. We increased our full year 2020 total revenue outlook to approximately $18.8 billion from $18.3 billion, mainly due to a higher Medicaid enrollment through the first half of the year, as well as revenue from YourCare membership, that is effective July 1, 2020. In taking this cautious approach to providing earnings guidance for the balance of the year, we have considered a wide range of potential outcomes from the factors that Joe previously described. Now I offer some additional items of note. The low yield environment and its drag on investment income should persist in the second half. We are likely to incur additional administrative expenses for COVID related operating protocols. We are also going to incur costs associated with the launch of our new Kentucky contract and integration costs associated with the Magellan Complete Care acquisition. And lastly as a reminder, consistent with our historical practice, previously announced acquisition that have not yet closed are excluded from our guidance. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Yes, thanks Joe. You're right, Josh. Our reserve methodology remained the same. We said that four to six months that the development is negligible on a PPD basis is slightly favorable, but it's not material. That's why we don't want to call it out. Yes, I would say that - I would say that within anything you do related to reserve, there's always judgment factor, there is range, and you can always argue you come pretty close to it. In prior years, we had a lot more development in that we tended to be a lot more cautious. We still are very conservative in our reserve methodology. So I wouldn't say there is anything inherently different. It's just the outcome is a little bit closer to our estimate."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Trudell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJulie Trudell: Good morning and thank you for joining Molina Healthcare's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. With me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Tom Tran. Press releases announcing our first quarter earnings and the definitive agreement to acquire Magellan Complete Care were distributed yesterday after the market closed. Press releases and the slide presentation regarding the MCC announcement are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay of this call will be available shortly after the conclusion of the call for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in our earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made herein are as of today Friday, May 1, 2020, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our first quarter 2020 press release. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements relating to our growth prospects, our 2020 guidance, a Magellan Complete Care acquisition and our long-term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report for the 2019 year filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call and take your questions. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?\nJoe Zubretsky: Thank you, Julie, and good morning. This is an unprecedented time. The COVID-19 pandemic has had and will continue to have a profound impact on our country, our state partners, our members and our employees. Our team has worked tirelessly over the past two months to ensure that the needs of all of our constituencies are addressed quickly in this rapidly changing and challenging environment. COVID-19 impact on the U.S. healthcare system and the overall economy will continue to develop during the year, no doubt causing some short-term challenges, but also serving to highlight the important role government-sponsored healthcare plays in this type of crisis. Clearly, the macroeconomic environment will significantly impact our results this year and for the foreseeable future. With that said, as a pure-play government managed care business, we remained well positioned at a time when reliable access to high-quality healthcare is more critical than ever to our members and our state partners. We would like to provide you with updates today on a number of fronts. First, we will cover the financial results for the first quarter. Second, we will discuss the new but hopefully temporary operating environment created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Third, we will convey our guidance in the context of our first quarter results and this new operating environment; and fourth and lastly, we will provide some detail about our exciting acquisition of Magellan Complete Care that we announced last evening and other updates to our pivot to growth initiatives. Let me start with specific first quarter highlights. We reported earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of $2.92, with net income of $178 million and an after-tax margin of 3.9%, which slightly exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Premium revenue was $4.3 billion, an 8.9% increase over the prior year, which is consistent with our pivot to growth. The medical care ratio was 86.3%. We experienced medical cost pressure in the Medicaid line of business early in the quarter, resulting from slightly higher-than-normal seasonal flu, combined with early, but at the time, unidentified COVID-19 costs. These increased costs were offset by lower medical costs in all lines of business very late in the quarter as elective and discretionary healthcare services began to be postponed and deferred. These offsetting factors, combined with negligible prior period reserve development, produced a medical care ratio that squarely met our expectations. We managed to a G&A ratio of 7%, in line with our expectations, even after reflecting incremental expenses associated with the mobilization of our workforce to work at home, and other new operational protocols related to COVID-19. The total company after-tax margin was 3.9%, in line with our expectations, comprising product line margins, of 3.2% in Medicaid, 8.4% in Medicare and 4.1% in Marketplace. While a $2.92 earnings per share result modestly exceeded our expectations, its achievement is noteworthy in the context of the environment in which it was produced, which brings us to our second topic. The dramatically different environment in which we currently operate and some of the changes we have made in response, to recap a few of these measures. As shelter in place directives and all-out shutdowns quickly spread throughout our geographic footprint, we swiftly moved substantially all of our associates to work at home. We accomplished this with no disruption to service, as service metrics have remained excellent. This is a remarkable accomplishment in light of the potential for disruption to utilization management, care management, network access and information technology infrastructure. Substantially, all of our company's workforce, 10,000 associates are currently working from home. Many providers have seen disruption to their patient and revenue flows. Providers are struggling more than ever with utilization management, payment integrity routines and associated protocols in a rapidly evolving environment, which their cash flows have suddenly declined. While this requires adaptability on our end, we maintained strong performance in network management and utilization control. To assist providers in this challenging time, we accelerated claim payments by $150 million in late March and early April, while also extending the term of all non-COVID-19-related prior authorizations through September 1, 2020. We also increased Telehealth visit reimbursement to be at parity with in person visits and have expedited credentialing to ensure we have ample provider capacity. We understand that COVID-19 creates a variety of challenges for our employees, including family members at home who may need support, children who require care. We quickly implemented broad-based programs to help them during this time, including two special stipends of $500 or a total of $1,000, and each of more than 9,000 of our employees. We also implemented pay enhancements for essential employees required to come to the workplace and an additional COVID-19 pay lead policy. We are responding to dozens, if not hundreds, of special requests by our state customers, CMS and other governmental agencies. For example, we eliminated all member costs for COVID-19 testing and related treatments. We relaxed utilization management protocols in specific instances. We expanded Telemedicine access to all members and we made substantial contributions to the supply of personal protection equipment. We also committed support and resources for various nonprofit organizations serving those in need across the country. Support, supplies and monetary donations have been made to a variety of trusted organizations that directly serve vulnerable populations. In summary, we would characterize our first quarter results as more than respectable, in the context of unprecedented disruption to the entire spectrum of traditional managed care operations that occurred over the span of just a few weeks. In this difficult operating environment, it should be noted that our financial position is strong as we had already done the hard work to develop very solid capital and liquidity positions. A few words about these matters. Our share repurchase program is now completed as we purchased a total of 3.4 million shares in the quarter for approximately $450 million at attractive prices. We drew down $380 million and remaining capacity of our term loan facility to bolster our liquidity. We availed ourselves of this inexpensive debt instrument, which would have otherwise expired in the coming quarter. And after the completion of the share repurchase program and the term loan facility draw, we are holding approximately $840 million in excess parent company cash. I'll turn now to our third topic, a discussion of our near-term outlook, starting with a description of the current dynamics of our industry. The business model, government managed care, particularly Medicaid, has been stress tested through extreme economic scenarios, including the financial crisis, the subsequent boom and now the effects of the world's worst pandemic in over 100 years. The model has proven to work in both robust economies and in deep recessions. In strong economic environments with low unemployment, there are relatively fewer Medicaid and subsidized Marketplace members, capitation rates tend to be on the strong side of actuarial soundness as state budgets are well funded. During challenging economic environments with high unemployment, there are relatively more Medicaid and subsidized Marketplace members, capitation rates tend to be on the lighter side of actuarial soundness as state's budgets become tighter. So while government managed care, particularly Medicaid, is certainly impacted by this environment, the business and financial model flexes to accommodate these unusual and sometimes extreme circumstances. In an extreme environment, like the one we are in today, government intervention is often required to provide rescue packages, backstop the healthcare system and the disadvantaged population. The current crisis is no exception, as Congress and The White House have stepped forward with a number of measures. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act includes additional assistance for state Medicaid programs in the form of an increase to the FMAP match. Each state has received a 6.2% increase, which will extend throughout the COVID-19 public health emergency declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. There have also been a number of legislative aid packages enacted, including the $2 trillion stimulus package and the additional $484 billion supplemental COVID-19 spending package referred to as Phase 3.5. These funds in various forms, have been made available to providers, small businesses, individuals and a number of other constituents which should ease the pressure on the healthcare system during this crisis, which indirectly should help the viability of Medicaid programs. In short, we have a stress-tested business model and significant government intervention designed to accelerate the economic recovery. But even in the presence of these very positive factors, which support a favorable outlook for the longer-term trajectory of the business, the near-term quarter-to-quarter outlook remains difficult to predict. This brings us to a discussion of our guidance for the remainder of 2020. Two overarching factors must be considered in providing guidance in this environment. First, we face a remarkably wide range of possible medical cost scenarios that could emerge over the next nine months. We have modeled many utilization scenarios for the balance of the year, all of which are plausible, but each of which produces dramatically different results. Second, we must consider the likelihood of a significant increase in membership as a direct result of widespread unemployment. With rising unemployment levels and the suspension of Medicaid eligibility redetermination in many states, we are now likely to experience a significant increase in combined Medicaid and Marketplace enrollment. But by how much? We do not yet know. These COVID-19 effects on medical cost and membership are widely expected to have a net positive effect on near-term earnings. However, we are not yet prepared to draw this conclusion based on the many variables and uncertainties that remain as managed care moves through the full course of the pandemic. We are, however, prepared to state that we view our original 2020 plan in our previously announced guidance with enhanced confidence. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our full year earnings per diluted share guidance range of $11.20 to $11.70. Let me briefly walk through the thought process that supports our guidance. With respect to medical costs, at this point, we cannot predict with any degree of precision how the COVID-19 situation will impact medical costs in 2020 for a variety of reasons. First, the level of future-direct COVID-19-related costs is not yet estimable, as the incidence rate of diagnosis and hospital admission and the related cost per episode remain unclear. We observed a steep decline in elective medical procedures very late in the first quarter, through the month of April, but we do not know how long this phenomenon will persist and begin to normalize. The prevailing expectation is that discretionary utilization could be very low for the second quarter and perhaps beyond, but then rebound quickly in the second half as COVID-19 abates, and health system capacity frees up. And any potential short-term and nonrecurring benefit from lower utilization is partially limited by rebates we could be obligated to pay under applicable minimum MLR regulations. With respect to our administrative costs, our operating efficiencies are secure, and our operating leverage discipline is intact. There will continue to be G&A pressure, however, related to nonstandard operating protocols and the cost structure required to service any significant additional membership. Investment income will certainly be lower than our original forecast as money market and other maturing fixed income investments grow over into much lower-yielding instruments. We call two, that our portfolio is short dated, so the impact is rather immediate. Before the onset of COVID-19, we fully expected to achieve our membership guidance. With the unfolding unemployment levels and suspension of Medicaid eligibility redetermination, we are now likely to exceed that guidance. But by how much? We do not yet know. We have developed various models and scenarios based on macro and microeconomic factors, which produce widely different results. The eventual outcome will be influenced by several key factors, including unemployment levels, particularly in the lower wage services economy, availability of spousal coverage and COBRA uptake. The impact of these factors is likely to be greater in the economically sensitive Medicaid expansion sector. Relatedly, pre-COVID, we fully expected to achieve our premium revenue forecast for the year of $17.4 billion. Our previous membership forecast was achievable, and our rates were generally known. Now it seems likely we could exceed our revenue forecast, depending on the timing and extent of the additional membership we just discussed. The YourCare acquisition will be an additional source of growth when closed. I also note again that any potential upside to annual earnings if limited by rebates, we would be obligated to pay under applicable minimum MLR regulations. In addition to our compliance with such regulations, even if our MCRs come in lower than our own internal targets, with a mindfulness of our civic responsibilities, in order to address any unexpected imbalances, we could choose to reinvest some of that margin and provider based quality of care initiatives and additional benefits for our members, here in the communities where they live. While the current near-term economic environment is unpredictable, government managed care business has consistently shown very attractive growth characteristics with compelling free cash flow generation. We are in the right business at the right time to serve our members, support our state partners and move with confidence and conviction into the future. However, we also believe that making accurate and perhaps bold statements about our longer-term future makes little sense at this time. Accordingly, we have decided to postpone our May 28 Investor Day and perhaps later in the year. For now, we are strictly heads down doing the hard work we need to be doing. I turn now to the fourth and final area of commentary this morning, an update on the many activities relating to our pivot-to-growth strategy. Even with the extraordinary level of activity related to COVID-19, which is now our highest priority, we have not lost sight of our near-term focus on top line growth. Opportunities to enhance and expand our portfolio in a substantial and synergistic way occur infrequently. Last night, we announced just such an achievement as we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Magellan Complete Care, or MCC, from Magellan Health. This transaction caps nearly a year-long effort, long predating the COVID-19 crisis and delivers compelling benefits that will endure for years to come. A single bolt-on acquisition, we add businesses in three new states and three over lapsed states to our portfolio at a purchase price equal to approximately 30% of the target's revenue. Pro forma, newly expanded Molina Healthcare which surpassed the $20 billion mark in annual revenue. Let me briefly describe the businesses we purchased, their strategic fit with our portfolio and the resulting financial metrics. As of December 31, 2019, MCC served approximately, 155,000 members across six states, Virginia, Arizona, Massachusetts, New York, Florida and Wisconsin. Full year 2019 revenue was greater than $2.7 billion, and we project it to grow to $3 billion within two years. Magellan Complete Care comprises the following businesses: Full-service Medicaid in Virginia, a new state, full-service Medicaid in Arizona, also a new state, dual eligibles and Massachusetts branded senior whole health, again, a new state, managed long-term care and New York Metro area, branded senior whole health, a new geography, and two small businesses, one in Florida and one in Wisconsin. The addition of the MCC properties allows us to apply our previously demonstrated operating excellence to bring these businesses to our target margins, harvest the full benefit of fixed cost leverage by adding more revenue with little additional fixed costs and launch Medicare and Marketplace in new Medicaid geographies. Turning to the financial metrics. The $820 million transaction, net of certain tax benefits, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. The purchase is funded entirely with cash on hand. We projected it will deliver returns well in excess of our cost of capital as our demonstrated operating capabilities puts us in a unique position to improve the margins of these businesses. As we move margins to our targets, deploy our enterprisewide platforms have the benefit of fixed cost leverage, we expect the acquisition to be accretive by approximately $0.50 to $0.75, cash earnings per diluted share in the first year of ownership and accreted by at least $1.75 in cash earnings per diluted share in the second year of ownership. These new additions to our portfolio demonstrate how carefully target M&A can accelerate our pivot to growth. With the addition of MCC, we will serve more than 3.6 million members in government-sponsored healthcare programs in 18 states. We will achieve enhanced geographic diversity, greater portfolio of depth, a meaningful addition of durable top line revenue. We will also be able to maintain continuity of care for MCC's members and stability for its state partners. These qualitative considerations have an added importance in the current environment and demonstrate our unwavering commitment to capably assist our government partners and bringing high-quality healthcare to individuals and families during this time of great need and into the future. Let me provide you with some additional highlights as it relates to our pivot-to-growth strategy. First, we terminated our agreement to purchase next level health due to the seller's stated unwillingness to close pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement. Second, in New Mexico, all legislative and political hurdles have been passed in connection with development of the first ever Indian managed care entity. We have been named as the exclusive manager of the managed care entity with the Navajo Nation. We stand poised and ready to serve the 75,000 Navajos eligible for Medicaid. Third, as previously announced, Texas canceled all of the new contracts associated with the STAR+ reprocurement awards, canceled the STAR chip RFP. The state has commented that it is not likely to reprocure this contract in the near term. And thus, we expect that our revenue base on this contract is secure at least through 2021. Fourth, we await the decision by the state of Kentucky on its Medicaid RFP, which we expect to be issued before the end of the second quarter. While Tennessee is the only state to specifically announce that it is postponing its RFP due to COVID-19, we believe there will be a general tendency by other states to also delay procurements until the COVID-19 crisis has abated. And finally, in our continued efforts to shape our business portfolio to optimize value, we have decided to sell our Puerto Rico Medicaid business. In doing so, we will work closely with the regulatory authorities and the provider community to ensure that our members in Puerto Rico are not disrupted and have reliable continuity of care. Now some concluding remarks. I hope it is clear to all that during this time, our members and customers are going to make requests of us to do the extraordinary. Our philosophy is to provide the health first and ask questions later. We trust that we will be adequately rewarded for the work we do and the services we provide. Although in this environment, we expect some nontraditional protocols to be invoked. This philosophy is not incongruent with shareholder friendliness at all. In fact, it is the epitome of a prudent environmental, social and governance philosophy, and the pillar of long-term business sustainability. We will fulfill our moral, civic and patriated duty, and we will emerge from this an even stronger company. Not only are we proving to be flexible and adaptable in this changing environment, but we will make sure our performance during this challenge, enhances our growing reputation among our existing customers and potential new customers alike, as a go-to resource in government-sponsored managed care. Before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to recognize our management team and the entire Molina community. During this unprecedented time, our team, 10,000 strong, has worked tirelessly to ensure that the needs of all of our constituencies continue to be addressed quickly and effectively. The true highlight of the quarter was the performance of our entire workforce and their rapid operational and clinical response across every dimension of the healthcare ecosystem, truly inspirational. They never lost sight of the members and the state partners who are counting on us to deliver whatever the challenge. Now I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for more detail on the financials. Tom?\nTom Tran: Thank you, Joe. This morning, I am going to provide some details on our first quarter results, provide additional insight into COVID-19's impact on our medical costs, and then I will provide more color on our 2020 guidance. So let me start with the quarter. Premium revenue for the first quarter of 2020 increased 8.9% to $4.3 billion compared to the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to rate increase in our Medicaid and Medicare lines of business. The consolidated MCR for the first quarter of 2020 increased to 86.3% compared to 85.3% for the first quarter of 2019. While prior year's reserve development in the first quarter of 2020 was negligible, the MCR in the first quarter of 2019 was positively impacted by approximately 140 basis points of favorable reserve development. The increase in the MCR in the first quarter of 2020 also reflects the increase in marketplace MCR. Now for some details on our results by line of business. In the Medicaid business, the MCR in the quarter was 88.9% compared to 88.5% in the first quarter of 2019. Our Medicaid performance for the first quarter of 2020 was solid. As we continue to manage medical costs, harvest the benefits of our payment integrity and utilization management protocols and attained risk score commensurate with the profiles of our members. In addition, the MCR in the prior year quarter was positively impact by the aforementioned favorable reserve development. The impact of COVID-19 on medical costs in the first quarter of 2020 was not significant. We experienced medical cost pressure in the Medicaid line of business early in the quarter, resulting from slightly higher-than-normal seasonal flu combined with early but lastly undetected COVID-19 costs, diagnosed as severe respiratory illness and pneumonia. We also experienced increased pharmacy costs in the quarters as members refuel the chronic medications in advance of the height of the crisis. This increased costs were offset by lower medical care costs in all lines of business very late in the quarter, as elective and discretionary healthcare services began to be postponed and deferred. In the Medicare business, the MCR for the first quarter of 2020 was 81.7% compared to 84.7%, in the first quarter of 2019, due to rate increase and higher quality incentive revenues. Finally, in the Marketplace business, the MCR for the first quarter of 2020 was 72.3% compared to 52.2% for the first quarter of 2019, which was mainly attributable to our lowering price in 2020 in an effort to be more competitive. The G&A ratio for the first quarter of 2020 improved to 7% compared to 7.3% in the first quarter of 2019, primarily related to increased revenues and positive operating leverage. The G&A for the quarter reflects approximately $6 million of incremental expense associated with the mobilization of our employees to work at home, along with other operational protocols associated with COVID-19. Now on to COVID. Let me offer some additional insights, but recognize that this picture is unfolding in real time. Some statistics, as we sit here today. Through April 27, we had a total of 950 members hospitalized with COVID-19, based on early data, the average length of stay is approximately 10 days, and there is no statistically credible cost per episode yet. In terms of geography, the health lands most impacted by COVID-19 are Washington, California and Michigan. While Washington was the first state impacted, Michigan has experienced the highest number of cases. While many of our states are estimated to have peaked, some have not. In proportion to our membership by line of business, Medicare has the highest percentage of incidents, followed by Medicaid and then Marketplace. Lastly, we experienced a steep decline in elective medical procedures beginning very late in March, which has continued through the month of April. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and our reserve position remains strong. Days in claim payable represents 49 days of medical cost expense compared to 50 days in the fourth quarter of 2019. Operating cash flow for the first quarter of 2020 was $136 million, with the change from the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to the timing of government payments and accelerated payments to providers. As of March 31, 2020, our health plans had total statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2 billion, which equates to approximately 347% of risk-based capital. Turning now to our 2020 guidance. We have reaffirmed our full year 2020 earnings guidance range of $11.20 to $11.70 per diluted share. First, let me walk through what is included in our full year guidance. Net investment income will experience headwinds in due to lower yields. We factor this in our guidance, and we expect it to be approximately $0.27 per share of headwind for the full year. Incremental G&A expenses related to COVID-19 for the balance of 2020 have also been considered. Now let me walk through what is excluded from our full year guidance. We recognize that rising unemployment levels are likely to result in an increase in Medicaid and Marketplace enrollment. However, we do not know the magnitude or timing and therefore, membership increase related to COVID-19 are excluded from our full year 2020 guidance. Due to uncertainty of COVID-19's impact on utilization and medical costs, its impact on net medical costs is excluded from full year 2020 guidance. I will also note that our full year 2020 guidance does not include the impact from previously announced acquisitions that have not yet closed. While the timing, duration and severity of COVID-19's impact on our financial metrics and earnings on an intra-quarter basis and throughout the rest of the year is not entirely predictable, we believe this is the most reasonable approach to providing guidance for the full year of 2020. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks, good morning, Joe, can you talk a little bit about the Magellan acquisition in terms of where you see margins along the trajectory of the of the accretion analysis? So where do you expect margins to be at the end of year one and year two to get to that accretion number?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, Justin. Let me I'll make sure I frame the deal first. This is right out of our playbook. And the way we think about this is this is sort of six bolt-on and tuck-in acquisitions all bundled into one. And as you know, what we've said many times, is we look for acquisitions that have stable membership, stable revenue flows and if they're underperforming, we certainly will bring to bear our operational excellence discipline and rigor in order to improve margins. So the way we look at this is you've seen the numbers. They are slightly profitable in the aggregate, approximately a 1% EBITDA margin. As you know, we've averaged about 6% or 6.5% EBITDA margins in the last couple of years. And if you can then pack on positive operating leverage, because we're not going to increase the fixed cost base of running our enterprise when we take these on, you can easily see how we got to the $0.50 to $0.75 of accretion in the first full year of ownership and at least $1.75 of cash earnings per share accretion in the second full year of ownership. So in the first year of ownership, we will most likely operate on their cost structure as integration activities take place. In year two, we will be migrating to the Molina cost structure, both our G&A platforms and the impact of payment integrity, utilization, management and risk or quality will begin to improve the medical cost ratios. And sometime in year three, we should reach the margins that we enjoy today in the moving of portfolio. Does that help?\nJustin Lake: Yes. That's really helpful, Joe. And then if I could just ask one more on cash. You talked about, I think, $840 million coming out of the quarter. Can you walk us through the moving parts for the rest of the year in terms of dividends from the subs, etc? And where you expect to end the year from a cash perspective as well as a leverage perspective?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, Justin. Well, yes, we ended the quarter with $840 million of free and clear cash at the parent company. If we achieve our earnings guidance for the year, we can project we project to extract approximately $500 million of ordinary dividends from our operating subs. That could be higher if we're able to get extraordinary dividends. Bear in mind, we have a $500 million untapped revolver. And in connection with this transaction, we topped up that revolver with a short-term facility of an additional $400 million. So to recap, $840 million of cash, our projection of extracting at least $500 million of ordinary dividends during the balance of 2020 and then two untapped facilities which aggregate to $900 million of debt capacity. I'll also remind the group that our high-yield debt is trading really well right now. And that we believe we have really good access to the high-yield market if we wanted to make any of this financing permanent. So that's the cash flow story.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Fidel of Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question, just wanted to ask on MCC and clearly, significant margin improvement opportunity. I think that is embedded in that deal for you. Interested what you're thinking in terms of what you can do to also accelerate top line growth from the MCC assets as well. And specifically, maybe thinking about the three new states, that you'll be entering. How could this potentially sort of tap into additional business-line opportunities for you and then in some of the other tap-on products that you'll be adding from this?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, Scott. There actually is an embedded growth rate in the acquired portfolio itself. The Arizona full-service Medicaid contract is at its very early stages. If I remember correctly, about 13,000 members at the end of the year with approximately $80 million in revenue. That's projected to achieve a membership of 75,000 to 80,000 over the next year. Because it enjoys a preferred position in the auto assignment algorithm in the state. So there's an inherent growth rate due to the Arizona property. And the point the second point you make is spot on. As you know, our strategy is to take our full product line and penetrate it into our Medicaid footprint. And now that we have a new Medicaid footprint in Arizona and in Virginia, we absolutely plan to launch a DSNP product in our Marketplace product in those geographies. And then, of course, just being in the boroughs in Westchester in New York city, gives you plenty of opportunities to look for bolt-on other bolt-on opportunities in the city and to perhaps grow the business. As you know, right now, we're in upstate New York. And don't have a produce in downstate New York. But this gives us plenty of opportunity to think more broadly about how to participate in Metro New York.\nScott Fidel: Got it. And then just my follow-up question. I understand that you're just hesitant right now to build in anything on revs or enrollment from rising unemployment. Just interested if you can maybe just give us a little insight into maybe just what you've seen so far in April. Possibly in the Medicaid and the Marketplace exchange lines, especially given states relaxing redetermination reviews?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure. I'm going to break with tradition air a little bit. You tend not to talk about what's going on in the current quarter, but this is an unusual time. And the points you mentioned are really, really important to pretend what could happen to membership. First thing I would point to is before talking about April, for the first time in many, many quarters, maybe even since I got here, we actually had membership growth in Medicaid sequentially March 31 over the end of the year. Good growth in Washington, Michigan, held steady, good growth in Illinois, offset by some losses in Puerto Rico. So our efforts to work with providers to keep more members in the system and to bring on more members are pushed to make sure that in the redetermination and re-eligibility process that we hold on to more members is starting to work. Pushing that forward now to the direct question you asked, it's even looking better in April. Our Medicaid membership is likely to be up over 30,000 members just in the month of April. And the interesting point I will make is we believe we're pretty sure that none of that membership arrived as a result of accelerated in the surge in unemployment. It's too soon to see people that became unemployed in March, end up in managed Medicaid. So we believe that the 30,000 growth in April is truly due to the suspension of eligibility of determination in the states. And without that churn, you're just not going to lose the members. They stay longer, they stick longer. And as you know, many states actually have suspended redetermination, and some have even announced perhaps even for a full year. So that really sort of pretends well for the membership growth before the surge due to unemployment actually arrived, which is likely to in May and beyond. Does that help?\nOperator: The next question today comes from Kevin Fishbeck of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fishbeck: Thanks. I was just wondering what you think the MLR might be on these new members coming into the Medicaid and to the exchange programs. I guess last recession, we did see some heads up demand initially on the new medicated lives. And just thinking about whether you expect that to happen. And on the Medicaid side, if these patients are members or people who would have been on COBRA, you expect any adverse MLR there?\nJoe Zubretsky: Yes, we have various views on it. I mean I think basically, and I think it's generally you say that if somebody needs insurance, they buy it. And if they don't, they won't. So there's just sort of an inherent bias, adverse selection bias in the whole process. We actually have various scenarios, some of which might say that there's higher acuity coming in through membership and some say that it will be on par with what we have. It's hard to say and where the number is coming from. Are they coming from a very rich self-insured plan and a big company? Or are they coming from a small group plan for a small business? So it's really hard to say right now, which is obviously one of the reasons why we're reluctant to predict what this surgeon membership brings. We'll see a surge on membership. We have to build the operational platforms and hire the people to service that membership and then as you suggested, the acuity of that membership is unknown. But I think the prevailing wisdom is, while it might be slightly better and worse than the average, that's not going to be a significant factor in taking on these members.\nKevin Fishbeck: All right. Great. And then when I look at your guidance, you're excluding a number of things from your guidance, but I see that pretty much all of them are the things that are most be positive than they are to be negative. Is there anything negative, really, I guess, that is not included in guidance or has the potential to be a significant negative?\nJoe Zubretsky: If understand your question correctly. The two factors that we updated in our guidance are one that's sort of easy to understand and engage. And that is our portfolio is going to roll over into lower-yielding investments. It's irrefutable and already happening. And I think Tom pitched that as a $27 earnings per share $0.27 earnings per share headwind in our guidance. We also believe putting the accelerated membership aside that we will incur higher SG&A related to COVID operational protocols, financial assistance to our employees, etc, which also we factored into our the reaffirmation of our guidance, but we did not update for anything else.\nKevin Fishbeck: Yes, that's what I'm saying. I'm saying you reaffirmed guidance, we're including some negative thing. You're actually getting a lot of the members, executing the deals and these things all seem like they're actually going to be upside to the number. So though it seems like there's going to be some upside to the number. I just want to know if there's anything else that you're excluding that you think might be the opposite way of the counteract or it's really just conservatism?\nJoe Zubretsky: No. It's basically just saying the production of core earnings just got a little better, but we did not factor in any of those COVID-19 impacts. But yes, with those headwinds, we're saying core earnings gets a little stronger.\nKevin Fishbeck: It's great, thanks.\nOperator: The next question today comes from Gary Taylor of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. I had two quick questions. The first one, I just want to go back to, Joe, your comments about Medicaid MLRs? I know there's also some states with pre-tax caps, but sort of the curves on how low MLR could effectively go and flow through earnings. So certainly, we understand that those exist. I guess the question is, on a state basis, are those all typically just calculate on the state fiscal or calendar year. There's no rolling period like there are in some of the federal minimum MLR requirements.\nJoe Zubretsky: Yes, Gary, that's my understanding. And there's very few adjustments like in the Marketplace MLR where taxes and all these other factors create a dramatic difference between the regulatory minimum and what you publish in your financials. But yes, seven of our 14 states have some form of MLR floor, ranging from 85% to 86%, except Puerto Rico, which is 92%. Those also exist in the expansion population and exist in the ABD business, but usually at different rates. So yes, there are very few adjustments from what you publish, and the minimum. And by understanding is they work on a one year fiscal year basis, not a rolling basis.\nGary Taylor: And my second question is you talked about 950 members hospitalized with COVID-19, no statistically credible cost per case. So I guess two questions. One, are those are the provider revenue cycle claim submissions being materially delayed? And then secondly, I thought most of your contracts in Medicaid would pay on a DRG basis, are you saying you're just not seeing the DRG coding yet? Or is there enough complexity to sort of outlier payments on outlier length of stay cases that dedicating all that still doesn't give you a good sense of the numbers yet?\nJoe Zubretsky: No, it's actually not that complicated. Again, 1,000 cases, so you can't draw any statistical credibility to that. We have five day stays, and we have one month stays. We have people in the ICU on ventilators and people that go in and go out. Cost range from $10,000 per episode to $100,000 per episode. But we're now capturing all the codes. And I think while Tom was suggesting in his prepared remarks was early in the quarter we are getting tagged with all types of respiratory elements, particularly in Washington and California. This was before COVID was a phenomenon. And we've hindsight and better information now, we have attributed that, and it has been attributed to COVID-19 actually showing up in Washington and California far before anybody actually thought it was. But no, there's no intrigue around how we're getting billed and coded for these things with only 1,000 data points, as I said, it's hard to draw any statistical conclusions. On your other point, we are not seeing any dramatic change in the administrative aspects of our provider dealings. We are seeing a drop in pre-authorizations, and claim submissions just because of the elected procedure deferrals. But there has not been a huge disruption in either the level of payments and the level of submissions that we've observed to date, that could change here over the next couple of months.\nGary Taylor: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Matthew Borsch of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Borsch: Yes, sir. Thank you. I was hoping you might comment on how you're thinking about the changes in enrollment trajectory over time. I realize that probably a number of scenarios you're looking at for how this recession plays out. But for lack of a better metric, I mean, do you think comparing with sort of duration and gap for 2008, 2009, it's the broad side of the barn?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure. Well, Matt, all of you have seen all of the different pundits and think tanks project what this might look like with unemployment scenarios ranging from 10%, 20%, even up to 30% with Medicaid roles expanding anywhere from 10 million to 30 million members. A very wide range of results. I think as we said in our prepared remarks, there are lots of factors to consider here. Number one, COBRA used to be a rather significant factor in how many members would come in. But now with subsidized Marketplace, you could argue that there will be more members attracted to the subsidized Marketplace which might be the 102% of premium that COBRA charges. So there's all types of phenomenon. Even on the unemployment rate, we have to look at subsectors of the economy. We're looking at the lower wage service economy. And I believe that's not going to come back quickly. That sandwich shop, that drycleaner shop, that coffee shop, these small businesses are going to struggle to get back into business. And we think that the lower-wages service economy will remain have higher unemployment rates for a longer period of time than perhaps the higher-wage sector of the economy. So if you take our market share, if you do a projection of unemployment in all of our states, ranging from 10% to 20%, look at our market shares, in Washington, it's 50%. In most states, it ranges from 5% to 25%, 9% on average. You can actually craft a scenario where the membership peaks at a pretty significant number. As unemployment softens, some of that goes back. But I think there's a permanent delta here on that lower-end service economy that's going to struggle to get back into business quickly.\nMatthew Borsch: Yes, that brings up a very closely related question, which is, again, we're shooting the dark here. But would you predict we might see some structural changes in how healthcare coverage is handled at the small group and particularly the lower end of the small group, maybe lower wage end of the spectrum, given it's been volatile for a while, and now it's even more volatile.\nJoe Zubretsky: It's a good question. I say during the all the swirl and the activity around this, I hadn't given that much thought. But the way we look at it is we now do have a product suite that works all the way up to 400% of federal poverty level when you think about it. So when we have Medicaid expansion in a variety of states, up to 138 then we have a highly subsidized Marketplace up into the 200, 250 range. We have products that the population can buy all the way up to that level. And so it would seem that we have the product suite, both commercial and government-sponsored that we need to satisfy the population. I hadn't given your specific question, a lot of thought during all this, but I will do so and get back to you on that.\nMatthew Borsch: Thank you.\nJoe Zubretsky: You're welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: You're asking. Your line is live. Perhaps, your line is muted. Sorry about that. Sorry I was on mute question around the exchanges. And I know it's early, but sort of April application processes and things that are coming in. I'm just trying to get a sense of as individuals move from the commercial markets into whether it's Medicaid or Marketplace. Sort of where do you think the magnitude of impact is going to be? And again, is there any data that you're seeing on Marketplace applications to date, that would be helpful.\nJoe Zubretsky: Right. We are seeing, I'd say, at this early stage, given that April data I was speaking about, we haven't seen Marketplace growth yet. But we have seen a slowing in the natural attrition rate. As we said at the beginning of the year when we gave our Marketplace forecast, we have reduced our attrition rate outlook to 1%, 1.5% a month. Which would suggest 3,000 to 4,500 members, that is slowing. We believe membership will start growing again here very soon. The point I was making before, I think, is the important one. Is that COBRA charges 102% of the full premium? And we believe, based on all the models we've looked at, that a highly or even reasonably sized subsidy in the Marketplace products, silver product, let's say, beats 102% of commercial all the time. And so we're likely to see more uptake in the Marketplace than maybe in past recessions when the Marketplace actually didn't exist. So now that it does exist, I think it's going to be the net beneficiary of folks who come out of commercial plans. And find that highly subsidized Marketplace product beat staying on COBRA.\nJosh Raskin: And Joe, just to follow-up on that point. Is it fair to assume that I know you talked about some of the adverse selection bias in processes like this where people buy insurance if they need it. But in this situation, isn't it fair to assume that COBRA, those remaining on COBRA are going to be ones that are more focused on continuity of care and have chronic needs and things like that? Are you assuming that the Marketplace membership may actually have a positive bias?\nJoe Zubretsky: Well, I think that's an excellent point. Generally speaking, if you're in the middle of some kind of expensive treatment protocol or our chronic member on expensive drugs, you just don't move because you're happy with what you have. But as you know, COBRA has unlimited life, and those members have to go somewhere eventually. Right now, we're not assuming anything other than we're building the infrastructure to make sure we can handle the influx of members. Jason Dees, who runs our Marketplace business, is very mindful of how do we capture really risk scores and risk profile in these members. So we know when we get them, how to treat them, how to get them into care plans, etc. So very early stages. I don't have any more thought on it than what I just gave you.\nJosh Raskin: And just one quick call on the revenue guidance, is there an assumption of pass-through revenues that are going to be coming through? Or is that in the bucket of COVID impact that we're not anticipating?\nJoe Zubretsky: I'm not sure I understand are you referring to a Medicaid? And I'm not sure what you're referring to exactly, Josh.\nJosh Raskin: Yes, Medicaid payments where you're going to see increases to the provider fee schedule they get passed through in terms of Medicaid.\nJoe Zubretsky: I think it's possible. I will answer the question more broadly. Most of our state customers are very concerned with the viability of various aspects of the medical communities in their states. And whether it's going to be enhancements to the fee schedule request, as you've seen, to pay claims faster, in some cases, even advanced payments to small providers, they are very focused on the health of the provider system. But we have not seen yet, from what I've been exposed to, any major changes to fee schedules. But there are many conversations ongoing about how to keep the providers funded during this entire process.\nJosh Raskin: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sarah James of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nSarah James: Thank you. I wanted to circle back to your comments that in a strong economy, Medicaid rates are set at the high end of actuarial soundness and in the recession, will be set at the low side. Can you give us more detail what is that meaningful margins when you think about the peak to trough move?\nJoe Zubretsky: I think the first thing I would say, Sarah, is we put a lot of faith in the concept of actuarial soundness, there's ebbs and flows. There's constant tension when benefits are carved in, when the benefits are carved out, when new populations are attempted to be capitated. There's a constant ebb and flow. And the only point we are making is if from a business model perspective, you would expect that in very strong economies when tax revenues are flowing, that rates would be on the strong side of actual soundness and the opposite could be true when tax revenues are down, in terms of recession. But the concept of actuarial soundness has proven in this industry. It's proven in the years that I've been here as testament to the margins that we're achieving. There are ebbs and flows. And all I'm suggesting is that in a recession, we could expect rates to be on the softer side of the actuarial soundness concept. But we still have not changed our outlook for our target margins, but a lot needs to be seen here in terms of what trend figures are going to be baked into the 2021 rates. Are we going to use normalized trends off of 2019? So when trend is inflecting the way it is, I think the bigger issue is when trend is inflecting up and down the way it is, how are the actuarial teams and our state customers and the actuarial teams of the managed care industry going to reconcile the various views of medical cost trend when we go to look at 2021 rates. But all that being said, I have a lot of faith and confidence in the actuarial soundness concept because it's actually worked well for managed Medicaid.\nSarah James: That's very helpful and comforting given how strong the relationship is with the state actuaries as medical trend does change. So just one more follow-up there. You mentioned that one of the possibilities could be items being carved in and carved out. Can you provide us any color on your discussions with states on how they're viewing the shape of their program, given where their budgets may be?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure. The one aspect of managed care and medical cost in managed care that comes to mind in your specific question is related to pharmacy. As you know, that is commonly discussed as to either be carved in or carved out. As you probably saw in the New York state budgetary process that was just finalized they have suggested that at some point in the future, New York State could carve out pharmacy. Obviously, not terribly material for us with a $200 million business there, but carving in and carving out is actually, in my view, more of a question of how much rate how much capitated rate do they put in or take out. We'd rather see it bundled into the full capitation and have more revenue. But if it's carved out, it's if they carve out on an unsubsidized basis, you lose your 2% margin on what's carved out and that's it. So you just you hope through the negotiating process that the proper amount of capitated rate is either carved in or carved out. That's the issue, in my opinion.\nOperator: The next question comes from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Yeah, good morning, guys and thanks for taking the questions a lot been covered. A lot has been covered. I guess, Joe, kind of a follow-up on the Magellan deals. As you think about the M&A environment, do you expect kind of the current environment that we're going into now to kind of make M&A more difficult or less difficult trying to figure out if people are targeting Medicaid enrollment to kind of defend smaller businesses and smaller plants, making them harder to acquire? Or could people see this as an opportunity to exit? And I have a quick follow-up for Tom.\nJoe Zubretsky: Interesting question. I think most of the investment banking community would tell you that in the past couple of weeks or months, that many of in-flight processes have stalled. This one's been going on for some time. And so it was able to get done with great cooperation from the guys from Magellan, and the teams worked well together. It's hard to say. I think this business is a tough business. And we look at some of the smaller players, the not for profits, the single state players, it's hard to get the operating leverage, the scale, the clinical resources you need to actually do a good job. It's just a tough business. But when this is all you do, and you have 3.5 million members and $20 billion of revenue, we certainly have the investable base, the skills and resources to be well here. So buying underperforming properties at 30% of revenue, getting the EBITDA margins up to 6%, 6.5%, that is a great use of our resources and our skills. Particularly when they're funded with cash that's generated from core operations, and we don't have to go to the equity markets or even the debt markets to fund them. So here in the foreseeable future. Obviously, we're going to be working on the regulatory process with Magellan, then we'll be integrating it. But we're still going to look for these single area bolt-on, tuck-in opportunities like the YourCare acquisition, which is fabulous for us. We're going to continue to look for them because we actually have the cash flow to action on them if they're actionable.\nGeorge Hill: That's helpful. And I guess, Tom, my quick follow-up for you is an accounting one, which is I know it's early, but if we start to think about the contracts where you guys have MLR minimums. I imagine at some point you'll have to reserve against revenue or have contra revenue accounts for what could be premium rebates or premium holidays. Have you guys started to do that yet? And is it too early to think about or discuss what the magnitude of that could look like?\nTom Tran: Good question there. And we do that consistently every quarter. As you know, in our marketplace, we have to provide reserve for potential rebate based on certain forecasting of the eventual medical care ratio. And we do the same thing for our Medicare line of business. And we will be doing the same thing for Medicaid, should that happen to be the situation.\nGeorge Hill: Okay. But I guess, no way to kind of quantify what the incremental could look like from normal versus kind of what we're stepping into the next couple of quarters?\nTom Tran: No. No. As we said in our prepared remarks, the volatility of this impact on from COVID on the impact on medical costs is unknown. That's why we hesitate to provide more color on that. So we'll have to let this thing play out over the next couple of quarters. And it's typically done based on either a calendar year or contract year depending on how the state prescribed that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDave Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Joe, you always have a great ability to cut right to the chase. My question is around operating Medicaid managed care organization in a COVID environment, thinking about a couple of transactions you now have in-flight that include New York operations at the center of COVID. So just interested in kind of understanding how you might see the future change in one's ability, the risks and opportunities in managing a plan in a cohort effected environment given that you seem willing to step right into the epicenter with both of these acquisitions, YourCare and MCC having significant operations in New York.\nJoe Zubretsky: Thanks for the question. It's look, it's a challenge. We moved 6,000 people from working in office to working at home. There are, as I said, hundreds of requests we're getting from regulators every day to do certain things. That requires you have to reconfigure your provider contracts. I mean the operating protocols and the amount of operational change that we're going through right now and dealing with all this is significant. But in New York, our business is in upstate New York, which is not the epicenter of COVID, but certainly is being impacted. The MLTSS business in New York is a good business. We managed $2 billion of LTSS benefits nationwide. I think we're the largest or the second largest manager of LTSS benefits. So it fits nicely with the portfolio. It's really it's not a medical business, per se. It's a business where we cater to the activities of daily living to pretty complex members under the Medicaid program. But it's a good business. It's got seven over $700 million in revenue. It's reasonably profitable. We think we can enhance the profitability by managing the hours more effectively. But COVID-19 was certainly a consideration as we actioned it. But we're either COVID-19 will either have abated by the time we own it or be so well understood and well managed, that it will be the new normal. So it was a consideration, but it did not deter us from wanting that property and including it in the purchase.\nDave Windley: Great. On exchange, you commented that you haven't really seen a material change in trajectory on membership there. Maybe that changes. Does that influence the what is likely to happen this year, influence the way that you will address your growth strategy in that business for 2021 after the 2020 kind of positioning didn't pan out as you thought it would?\nJoe Zubretsky: It's a very good point. I will expect in the question, I will reiterate that our strategy hasn't changed. We had committed to growing the pool of profits of the exchange business. And had articulated that we will make the local geographic call as to where to push price for gaining membership and where it ease on or where to push price to gain members push price down to game membership, and we're ease up on it to gain margin and make local decisions based on competitive forces. And obviously, as you suggested, and admittedly, we got the elasticity of demand equation long last year. The bigger issue for us. So the strategy hasn't changed. We're going to take the full profits and attempt to grow it over time at reasonable margins. The rent that's been thrown into the works, obviously, is coded. Right now, as we sit here today, we're developing the pricing model for 2021. They're off of the 2019 baseline, which is pure of COVID. But the question will really be, what type of rates go into the market for 2021, given the COVID environment that we're in right now? So our belief is that in discussions with regulators, allowances will be made for maybe some later rate filings, maybe rate filings that include COVID and others that don't. Allow us to see more so that we can take a reasonable view of medical cost trend, getting into the rate so that we're not guessing, and the industry is not guessing. We don't want to push so much rate into the market that we have excess margins, and we certainly don't want to undercut it to where margins are too low. We want to get it right. So we're working with the regulators right now on the pricing regimen for 2021.\nDave Windley: Got it. One last one, if I could. What level of cash do you want to have liquidity, do you want to have to run the business? And are you willing to add more leverage in this environment?\nJoe Zubretsky: Our leverage position is very strong, and I would encourage people not to look at our debt to total cap, which averages 40% to 45%, I think, it's 46% at the end of the quarter. Because that generally just sounds high to people. Our debt-to-EBITDA coverage is 1:1. Our leverage is 1:1. Our fixed interest cost coverage is like three weeks of earnings. We've covered our fixed charges and interest. So we're actually underlevered from a cash flow perspective. Having said that, in this environment, you always want to be more liquid than you otherwise would, but with $840 million of cash, $500 million of dividends expected this year, $900 million of untapped facilities, we believe we still have enough cash and enough liquidity cushion that have another bolt-on acquisition opportunity came up this month, next month or next quarter, we'd be able to action it. But in this environment, you want to be a little more liquid than normal. We usually target $100 million of parent company cash as a floor, and we'd probably think slightly higher than that in this environment\nOperator: The next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley..\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Alex [ph] actually in for Ricky. First question, I just have two. One is just following up on George's question about M&A. So you talked about how Magellan is kind of a year-long for to close so could you give some color just on the typical time line to get your deals ready to announce? And how many kind of companies that you're looking at, at any given time?\nJoe Zubretsky: Well, without getting into the process because that's we don't really want to do that. But the point what we wanted to make was that this efforts or long predated coped when the process started. And that was the only point we're really making. But willing buyer, willing seller, it's hard. There's a lot of properties out there, and many of them aren't actionable. But getting something that strategically fits from a product and geography perspective, and then one that's actionable is hard work. We have an expert M&A group, led by Mark Keim and a great team of people who are scanning the universe for actionable opportunities that fit with the portfolio and that are actionable. And last year, we found YourCare, we found NextLevel, but we obviously terminated our agreement with the NextLevel for very good reasons. And then this opportunity came into the market, and we worked it really, really hard with great cooperation from the folks from Magellan. There are others in the pipeline. I can't mention what they are and where they are, but there are still properties out there that are actionable, and we still have the liquidity and the resources to action them if, in fact, they come to market and can be actioned.\nUnidentified Analyst: That's helpful. And then just on the deferred elective care side. We've heard ranges over the last week, about 15% to 40% of total medical costs are associated with elective care. Is there anything that you can give us on how your elective costs compare to your book?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure. It's hard to draw any conclusions from two weeks in March, but we certainly could draw conclusions from the full month of April. On the outpatient and professional services side, outpatient and ambulatory surgeries, depending on the geography line of business, pre authorization requests and notifications down 30% to 50%. Diagnostic testing and imaging, another sort of elective category, 40% to 45% PCP referrals to specialists, DNA, all down significantly over comparable periods. We're a seeing it on the inpatient side, particularly with elective surgeries and even in behavioral services. So in the medical cost categories that tend to be elective and discretionary we're seeing pre authorization requests and notifications down significantly over comparable periods. The other point I would make here is how long does this persist? There are various mandates of the suspension of elective procedures. That can't be done under either state authority or governmental authority that will end soon at some point. But there will be a contagion of fear of patient fear of going into facilities for the risk of being infected. So how fast they rebound, how fast the boomerang effect and when they come back, is another factor and why predicting what medical costs look like here over the next three to six months is difficult. I remind everyone, when we're talking about the rebound factor is there's a capacity limitation on how fast things can rebound. There are only so many beds. There are only so many doctors, and there's only so many hours in a day. And when you have three, four, five or even six months of pent-up demand, it cannot race through the pipe that quickly. There's a capacity limitation on how fast it rebounds, which adds another variable into forecasting how quickly this could rebound. So I hope that helps, but that's sort of a view of what March and April looked like from an elective and discretionary procedure outlook.\nOperator: The next question comes from Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCharles Rhyee: Yeah, thanks for taking quite not just to make just maybe two quick questions for me here. Joe, you talked about potential delays of decisions. But you still said you expected Kentucky sometime in the second quarter. So are you still expecting Kentucky to make a decision in the second quarter? Or do you think that is upward delay?\nJoe Zubretsky: We've been told that actually, we were told month of May, but we wanted to just open it up in the second quarter because we just weren't sure. But we've actually originally, they actually posted that they were going to do it in April and then due to COVID-19, they actually then pushed it. And whether it's actually published in writing or they made an announcement, I can't recall. But they did say May, but we sort of opened it up and said sometime in the second quarter. So we haven't heard about a suspension. And until we hear otherwise, we still expect the second quarter announcement.\nCharles Rhyee: Great. And then, Joe, at the beginning, you kind of also mentioned about some of the things you are doing for your members, including opening access for Telehealth. And we saw the announcement, obviously, several weeks back about using Teledoc. Can you just help us understand a little bit how Telehealth is priced for a Medicaid population when you extend it to your members? Is that should we think about it in the same way as for commercial population that the members are paying some dollar visit fee? Or is that something that you guys include in sort of the overall cost that you're charging to state?\nJoe Zubretsky: The first thing I would say to that is in our company, our Telehealth solution is more fully implemented in our Marketplace product than it is in our Medicaid product. It is beginning to be rolled out in our Medicaid product. And obviously, this accelerated the rollout because it was the right thing to do and members couldn't get in person visits. As we said in our prepared remarks, we created a parity mechanism between in-person visits and Telehealth visits. But I wouldn't want to say how it's priced, but it's more penetrated as we're searching for in our Marketplace book, than our Medicaid book. And we have a contract, we pay for it, and it's loaded in the benefit, is really all I can say.\nCharles Rhyee: I understand that. I mean I guess, is there a cost sharing then? Do members pay some amount to access it like they would in a commercial population? In a more typical commercial population? Or is it done differently? I guess...\nJoe Zubretsky: Well, generally, in Medicaid, the members are not paying anything out of pocket for any service. So in Medicaid, the answer is no. And I believe I'll project this and get back to you. But in Marketplace, it's probably like any other claim payment. If somebody's decided they're deductible, it gets treated that way. If there's a co-pay whatever the benefit plan is, I think it gets treated just like another claim pursuant to the benefit structure of the contract.\nCharles Rhyee: Okay, thanks, that's it. Really helpful.\nJoe Zubretsky: Thank you.\nOperator: As there are no further questions, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. The conference has now also concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tom Tran",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe. This morning, I am going to provide some details on our first quarter results, provide additional insight into COVID-19's impact on our medical costs, and then I will provide more color on our 2020 guidance. So let me start with the quarter. Premium revenue for the first quarter of 2020 increased 8.9% to $4.3 billion compared to the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to rate increase in our Medicaid and Medicare lines of business. The consolidated MCR for the first quarter of 2020 increased to 86.3% compared to 85.3% for the first quarter of 2019. While prior year's reserve development in the first quarter of 2020 was negligible, the MCR in the first quarter of 2019 was positively impacted by approximately 140 basis points of favorable reserve development. The increase in the MCR in the first quarter of 2020 also reflects the increase in marketplace MCR. Now for some details on our results by line of business. In the Medicaid business, the MCR in the quarter was 88.9% compared to 88.5% in the first quarter of 2019. Our Medicaid performance for the first quarter of 2020 was solid. As we continue to manage medical costs, harvest the benefits of our payment integrity and utilization management protocols and attained risk score commensurate with the profiles of our members. In addition, the MCR in the prior year quarter was positively impact by the aforementioned favorable reserve development. The impact of COVID-19 on medical costs in the first quarter of 2020 was not significant. We experienced medical cost pressure in the Medicaid line of business early in the quarter, resulting from slightly higher-than-normal seasonal flu combined with early but lastly undetected COVID-19 costs, diagnosed as severe respiratory illness and pneumonia. We also experienced increased pharmacy costs in the quarters as members refuel the chronic medications in advance of the height of the crisis. This increased costs were offset by lower medical care costs in all lines of business very late in the quarter, as elective and discretionary healthcare services began to be postponed and deferred. In the Medicare business, the MCR for the first quarter of 2020 was 81.7% compared to 84.7%, in the first quarter of 2019, due to rate increase and higher quality incentive revenues. Finally, in the Marketplace business, the MCR for the first quarter of 2020 was 72.3% compared to 52.2% for the first quarter of 2019, which was mainly attributable to our lowering price in 2020 in an effort to be more competitive. The G&A ratio for the first quarter of 2020 improved to 7% compared to 7.3% in the first quarter of 2019, primarily related to increased revenues and positive operating leverage. The G&A for the quarter reflects approximately $6 million of incremental expense associated with the mobilization of our employees to work at home, along with other operational protocols associated with COVID-19. Now on to COVID. Let me offer some additional insights, but recognize that this picture is unfolding in real time. Some statistics, as we sit here today. Through April 27, we had a total of 950 members hospitalized with COVID-19, based on early data, the average length of stay is approximately 10 days, and there is no statistically credible cost per episode yet. In terms of geography, the health lands most impacted by COVID-19 are Washington, California and Michigan. While Washington was the first state impacted, Michigan has experienced the highest number of cases. While many of our states are estimated to have peaked, some have not. In proportion to our membership by line of business, Medicare has the highest percentage of incidents, followed by Medicaid and then Marketplace. Lastly, we experienced a steep decline in elective medical procedures beginning very late in March, which has continued through the month of April. Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and our reserve position remains strong. Days in claim payable represents 49 days of medical cost expense compared to 50 days in the fourth quarter of 2019. Operating cash flow for the first quarter of 2020 was $136 million, with the change from the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to the timing of government payments and accelerated payments to providers. As of March 31, 2020, our health plans had total statutory capital and surplus of approximately $2 billion, which equates to approximately 347% of risk-based capital. Turning now to our 2020 guidance. We have reaffirmed our full year 2020 earnings guidance range of $11.20 to $11.70 per diluted share. First, let me walk through what is included in our full year guidance. Net investment income will experience headwinds in due to lower yields. We factor this in our guidance, and we expect it to be approximately $0.27 per share of headwind for the full year. Incremental G&A expenses related to COVID-19 for the balance of 2020 have also been considered. Now let me walk through what is excluded from our full year guidance. We recognize that rising unemployment levels are likely to result in an increase in Medicaid and Marketplace enrollment. However, we do not know the magnitude or timing and therefore, membership increase related to COVID-19 are excluded from our full year 2020 guidance. Due to uncertainty of COVID-19's impact on utilization and medical costs, its impact on net medical costs is excluded from full year 2020 guidance. I will also note that our full year 2020 guidance does not include the impact from previously announced acquisitions that have not yet closed. While the timing, duration and severity of COVID-19's impact on our financial metrics and earnings on an intra-quarter basis and throughout the rest of the year is not entirely predictable, we believe this is the most reasonable approach to providing guidance for the full year of 2020. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Good question there. And we do that consistently every quarter. As you know, in our marketplace, we have to provide reserve for potential rebate based on certain forecasting of the eventual medical care ratio. And we do the same thing for our Medicare line of business. And we will be doing the same thing for Medicaid, should that happen to be the situation. No. No. As we said in our prepared remarks, the volatility of this impact on from COVID on the impact on medical costs is unknown. That's why we hesitate to provide more color on that. So we'll have to let this thing play out over the next couple of quarters. And it's typically done based on either a calendar year or contract year depending on how the state prescribed that."

The COVID-19 pandemic has had and will continue to have a profound impact on our country, our state partners, our members and our employees. Our team has worked tirelessly over the past two months to ensure that the needs of all of our constituencies are addressed quickly in this rapidly changing and challenging environment. COVID-19 impact on the U.S. healthcare system and the overall economy will continue to develop during the year, no doubt causing some short-term challenges, but also serving to highlight the important role government-sponsored healthcare plays in this type of crisis. Clearly, the macroeconomic environment will significantly impact our results this year and for the foreseeable future. With that said, as a pure-play government managed care business, we remained well positioned at a time when reliable access to high-quality healthcare is more critical than ever to our members and our state partners. We would like to provide you with updates today on a number of fronts. First, we will cover the financial results for the first quarter. Second, we will discuss the new but hopefully temporary operating environment created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Third, we will convey our guidance in the context of our first quarter results and this new operating environment; and fourth and lastly, we will provide some detail about our exciting acquisition of Magellan Complete Care that we announced last evening and other updates to our pivot to growth initiatives. Let me start with specific first quarter highlights. We reported earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of $2.92, with net income of $178 million and an after-tax margin of 3.9%, which slightly exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Premium revenue was $4.3 billion, an 8.9% increase over the prior year, which is consistent with our pivot to growth. The medical care ratio was 86.3%. We experienced medical cost pressure in the Medicaid line of business early in the quarter, resulting from slightly higher-than-normal seasonal flu, combined with early, but at the time, unidentified COVID-19 costs. These increased costs were offset by lower medical costs in all lines of business very late in the quarter as elective and discretionary healthcare services began to be postponed and deferred. These offsetting factors, combined with negligible prior period reserve development, produced a medical care ratio that squarely met our expectations. We managed to a G&A ratio of 7%, in line with our expectations, even after reflecting incremental expenses associated with the mobilization of our workforce to work at home, and other new operational protocols related to COVID-19. The total company after-tax margin was 3.9%, in line with our expectations, comprising product line margins, of 3.2% in Medicaid, 8.4% in Medicare and 4.1% in Marketplace. While a $2.92 earnings per share result modestly exceeded our expectations, its achievement is noteworthy in the context of the environment in which it was produced, which brings us to our second topic. The dramatically different environment in which we currently operate and some of the changes we have made in response, to recap a few of these measures. As shelter in place directives and all-out shutdowns quickly spread throughout our geographic footprint, we swiftly moved substantially all of our associates to work at home. We accomplished this with no disruption to service, as service metrics have remained excellent. This is a remarkable accomplishment in light of the potential for disruption to utilization management, care management, network access and information technology infrastructure. Substantially, all of our company's workforce, 10,000 associates are currently working from home. Many providers have seen disruption to their patient and revenue flows. Providers are struggling more than ever with utilization management, payment integrity routines and associated protocols in a rapidly evolving environment, which their cash flows have suddenly declined. While this requires adaptability on our end, we maintained strong performance in network management and utilization control. To assist providers in this challenging time, we accelerated claim payments by $150 million in late March and early April, while also extending the term of all non-COVID-19-related prior authorizations through September 1, 2020. We also increased Telehealth visit reimbursement to be at parity with in person visits and have expedited credentialing to ensure we have ample provider capacity. We understand that COVID-19 creates a variety of challenges for our employees, including family members at home who may need support, children who require care. We quickly implemented broad-based programs to help them during this time, including two special stipends of $500 or a total of $1,000, and each of more than 9,000 of our employees. We also implemented pay enhancements for essential employees required to come to the workplace and an additional COVID-19 pay lead policy. We are responding to dozens, if not hundreds, of special requests by our state customers, CMS and other governmental agencies. For example, we eliminated all member costs for COVID-19 testing and related treatments. We relaxed utilization management protocols in specific instances. We expanded Telemedicine access to all members and we made substantial contributions to the supply of personal protection equipment. We also committed support and resources for various nonprofit organizations serving those in need across the country. Support, supplies and monetary donations have been made to a variety of trusted organizations that directly serve vulnerable populations. In summary, we would characterize our first quarter results as more than respectable, in the context of unprecedented disruption to the entire spectrum of traditional managed care operations that occurred over the span of just a few weeks. In this difficult operating environment, it should be noted that our financial position is strong as we had already done the hard work to develop very solid capital and liquidity positions. A few words about these matters. Our share repurchase program is now completed as we purchased a total of 3.4 million shares in the quarter for approximately $450 million at attractive prices. We drew down $380 million and remaining capacity of our term loan facility to bolster our liquidity. We availed ourselves of this inexpensive debt instrument, which would have otherwise expired in the coming quarter. And after the completion of the share repurchase program and the term loan facility draw, we are holding approximately $840 million in excess parent company cash. I'll turn now to our third topic, a discussion of our near-term outlook, starting with a description of the current dynamics of our industry. The business model, government managed care, particularly Medicaid, has been stress tested through extreme economic scenarios, including the financial crisis, the subsequent boom and now the effects of the world's worst pandemic in over 100 years. The model has proven to work in both robust economies and in deep recessions. In strong economic environments with low unemployment, there are relatively fewer Medicaid and subsidized Marketplace members, capitation rates tend to be on the strong side of actuarial soundness as state budgets are well funded. During challenging economic environments with high unemployment, there are relatively more Medicaid and subsidized Marketplace members, capitation rates tend to be on the lighter side of actuarial soundness as state's budgets become tighter. So while government managed care, particularly Medicaid, is certainly impacted by this environment, the business and financial model flexes to accommodate these unusual and sometimes extreme circumstances. In an extreme environment, like the one we are in today, government intervention is often required to provide rescue packages, backstop the healthcare system and the disadvantaged population. The current crisis is no exception, as Congress and The White House have stepped forward with a number of measures. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act includes additional assistance for state Medicaid programs in the form of an increase to the FMAP match. Each state has received a 6.2% increase, which will extend throughout the COVID-19 public health emergency declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. There have also been a number of legislative aid packages enacted, including the $2 trillion stimulus package and the additional $484 billion supplemental COVID-19 spending package referred to as Phase 3.5. These funds in various forms, have been made available to providers, small businesses, individuals and a number of other constituents which should ease the pressure on the healthcare system during this crisis, which indirectly should help the viability of Medicaid programs. In short, we have a stress-tested business model and significant government intervention designed to accelerate the economic recovery. But even in the presence of these very positive factors, which support a favorable outlook for the longer-term trajectory of the business, the near-term quarter-to-quarter outlook remains difficult to predict. This brings us to a discussion of our guidance for the remainder of 2020. Two overarching factors must be considered in providing guidance in this environment. First, we face a remarkably wide range of possible medical cost scenarios that could emerge over the next nine months. We have modeled many utilization scenarios for the balance of the year, all of which are plausible, but each of which produces dramatically different results. Second, we must consider the likelihood of a significant increase in membership as a direct result of widespread unemployment. With rising unemployment levels and the suspension of Medicaid eligibility redetermination in many states, we are now likely to experience a significant increase in combined Medicaid and Marketplace enrollment. But by how much? We do not yet know. These COVID-19 effects on medical cost and membership are widely expected to have a net positive effect on near-term earnings. However, we are not yet prepared to draw this conclusion based on the many variables and uncertainties that remain as managed care moves through the full course of the pandemic. We are, however, prepared to state that we view our original 2020 plan in our previously announced guidance with enhanced confidence. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our full year earnings per diluted share guidance range of $11.20 to $11.70. Let me briefly walk through the thought process that supports our guidance. With respect to medical costs, at this point, we cannot predict with any degree of precision how the COVID-19 situation will impact medical costs in 2020 for a variety of reasons. First, the level of future-direct COVID-19-related costs is not yet estimable, as the incidence rate of diagnosis and hospital admission and the related cost per episode remain unclear. We observed a steep decline in elective medical procedures very late in the first quarter, through the month of April, but we do not know how long this phenomenon will persist and begin to normalize. The prevailing expectation is that discretionary utilization could be very low for the second quarter and perhaps beyond, but then rebound quickly in the second half as COVID-19 abates, and health system capacity frees up. And any potential short-term and nonrecurring benefit from lower utilization is partially limited by rebates we could be obligated to pay under applicable minimum MLR regulations. With respect to our administrative costs, our operating efficiencies are secure, and our operating leverage discipline is intact. There will continue to be G&A pressure, however, related to nonstandard operating protocols and the cost structure required to service any significant additional membership. Investment income will certainly be lower than our original forecast as money market and other maturing fixed income investments grow over into much lower-yielding instruments. We call two, that our portfolio is short dated, so the impact is rather immediate. Before the onset of COVID-19, we fully expected to achieve our membership guidance. With the unfolding unemployment levels and suspension of Medicaid eligibility redetermination, we are now likely to exceed that guidance. But by how much? We do not yet know. We have developed various models and scenarios based on macro and microeconomic factors, which produce widely different results. The eventual outcome will be influenced by several key factors, including unemployment levels, particularly in the lower wage services economy, availability of spousal coverage and COBRA uptake. The impact of these factors is likely to be greater in the economically sensitive Medicaid expansion sector. Relatedly, pre-COVID, we fully expected to achieve our premium revenue forecast for the year of $17.4 billion. Our previous membership forecast was achievable, and our rates were generally known. Now it seems likely we could exceed our revenue forecast, depending on the timing and extent of the additional membership we just discussed. The YourCare acquisition will be an additional source of growth when closed. I also note again that any potential upside to annual earnings if limited by rebates, we would be obligated to pay under applicable minimum MLR regulations. In addition to our compliance with such regulations, even if our MCRs come in lower than our own internal targets, with a mindfulness of our civic responsibilities, in order to address any unexpected imbalances, we could choose to reinvest some of that margin and provider based quality of care initiatives and additional benefits for our members, here in the communities where they live. While the current near-term economic environment is unpredictable, government managed care business has consistently shown very attractive growth characteristics with compelling free cash flow generation. We are in the right business at the right time to serve our members, support our state partners and move with confidence and conviction into the future. However, we also believe that making accurate and perhaps bold statements about our longer-term future makes little sense at this time. Accordingly, we have decided to postpone our May 28 Investor Day and perhaps later in the year. For now, we are strictly heads down doing the hard work we need to be doing. I turn now to the fourth and final area of commentary this morning, an update on the many activities relating to our pivot-to-growth strategy. Even with the extraordinary level of activity related to COVID-19, which is now our highest priority, we have not lost sight of our near-term focus on top line growth. Opportunities to enhance and expand our portfolio in a substantial and synergistic way occur infrequently. Last night, we announced just such an achievement as we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Magellan Complete Care, or MCC, from Magellan Health. This transaction caps nearly a year-long effort, long predating the COVID-19 crisis and delivers compelling benefits that will endure for years to come. A single bolt-on acquisition, we add businesses in three new states and three over lapsed states to our portfolio at a purchase price equal to approximately 30% of the target's revenue. Pro forma, newly expanded Molina Healthcare which surpassed the $20 billion mark in annual revenue. Let me briefly describe the businesses we purchased, their strategic fit with our portfolio and the resulting financial metrics. As of December 31, 2019, MCC served approximately, 155,000 members across six states, Virginia, Arizona, Massachusetts, New York, Florida and Wisconsin. Full year 2019 revenue was greater than $2.7 billion, and we project it to grow to $3 billion within two years. Magellan Complete Care comprises the following businesses: Full-service Medicaid in Virginia, a new state, full-service Medicaid in Arizona, also a new state, dual eligibles and Massachusetts branded senior whole health, again, a new state, managed long-term care and New York Metro area, branded senior whole health, a new geography, and two small businesses, one in Florida and one in Wisconsin. The addition of the MCC properties allows us to apply our previously demonstrated operating excellence to bring these businesses to our target margins, harvest the full benefit of fixed cost leverage by adding more revenue with little additional fixed costs and launch Medicare and Marketplace in new Medicaid geographies. Turning to the financial metrics. The $820 million transaction, net of certain tax benefits, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. The purchase is funded entirely with cash on hand. We projected it will deliver returns well in excess of our cost of capital as our demonstrated operating capabilities puts us in a unique position to improve the margins of these businesses. As we move margins to our targets, deploy our enterprisewide platforms have the benefit of fixed cost leverage, we expect the acquisition to be accretive by approximately $0.50 to $0.75, cash earnings per diluted share in the first year of ownership and accreted by at least $1.75 in cash earnings per diluted share in the second year of ownership. These new additions to our portfolio demonstrate how carefully target M&A can accelerate our pivot to growth. With the addition of MCC, we will serve more than 3.6 million members in government-sponsored healthcare programs in 18 states. We will achieve enhanced geographic diversity, greater portfolio of depth, a meaningful addition of durable top line revenue. We will also be able to maintain continuity of care for MCC's members and stability for its state partners. These qualitative considerations have an added importance in the current environment and demonstrate our unwavering commitment to capably assist our government partners and bringing high-quality healthcare to individuals and families during this time of great need and into the future. Let me provide you with some additional highlights as it relates to our pivot-to-growth strategy. First, we terminated our agreement to purchase next level health due to the seller's stated unwillingness to close pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement. Second, in New Mexico, all legislative and political hurdles have been passed in connection with development of the first ever Indian managed care entity. We have been named as the exclusive manager of the managed care entity with the Navajo Nation. We stand poised and ready to serve the 75,000 Navajos eligible for Medicaid. Third, as previously announced, Texas canceled all of the new contracts associated with the STAR+ reprocurement awards, canceled the STAR chip RFP. The state has commented that it is not likely to reprocure this contract in the near term. And thus, we expect that our revenue base on this contract is secure at least through 2021. Fourth, we await the decision by the state of Kentucky on its Medicaid RFP, which we expect to be issued before the end of the second quarter. While Tennessee is the only state to specifically announce that it is postponing its RFP due to COVID-19, we believe there will be a general tendency by other states to also delay procurements until the COVID-19 crisis has abated. And finally, in our continued efforts to shape our business portfolio to optimize value, we have decided to sell our Puerto Rico Medicaid business. In doing so, we will work closely with the regulatory authorities and the provider community to ensure that our members in Puerto Rico are not disrupted and have reliable continuity of care. Now some concluding remarks. I hope it is clear to all that during this time, our members and customers are going to make requests of us to do the extraordinary. Our philosophy is to provide the health first and ask questions later. We trust that we will be adequately rewarded for the work we do and the services we provide. Although in this environment, we expect some nontraditional protocols to be invoked. This philosophy is not incongruent with shareholder friendliness at all. In fact, it is the epitome of a prudent environmental, social and governance philosophy, and the pillar of long-term business sustainability. We will fulfill our moral, civic and patriated duty, and we will emerge from this an even stronger company. Not only are we proving to be flexible and adaptable in this changing environment, but we will make sure our performance during this challenge, enhances our growing reputation among our existing customers and potential new customers alike, as a go-to resource in government-sponsored managed care. Before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to recognize our management team and the entire Molina community. During this unprecedented time, our team, 10,000 strong, has worked tirelessly to ensure that the needs of all of our constituencies continue to be addressed quickly and effectively. The true highlight of the quarter was the performance of our entire workforce and their rapid operational and clinical response across every dimension of the healthcare ecosystem, truly inspirational. They never lost sight of the members and the state partners who are counting on us to deliver whatever the challenge. Now I will turn the call over to Tom Tran for more detail on the financials. Tom? Sure, Justin. Let me I'll make sure I frame the deal first. This is right out of our playbook. And the way we think about this is this is sort of six bolt-on and tuck-in acquisitions all bundled into one. And as you know, what we've said many times, is we look for acquisitions that have stable membership, stable revenue flows and if they're underperforming, we certainly will bring to bear our operational excellence discipline and rigor in order to improve margins. So the way we look at this is you've seen the numbers. They are slightly profitable in the aggregate, approximately a 1% EBITDA margin. As you know, we've averaged about 6% or 6.5% EBITDA margins in the last couple of years. And if you can then pack on positive operating leverage, because we're not going to increase the fixed cost base of running our enterprise when we take these on, you can easily see how we got to the $0.50 to $0.75 of accretion in the first full year of ownership and at least $1.75 of cash earnings per share accretion in the second full year of ownership. So in the first year of ownership, we will most likely operate on their cost structure as integration activities take place. In year two, we will be migrating to the Molina cost structure, both our G&A platforms and the impact of payment integrity, utilization, management and risk or quality will begin to improve the medical cost ratios. And sometime in year three, we should reach the margins that we enjoy today in the moving of portfolio. Does that help? Sure, Justin. Well, yes, we ended the quarter with $840 million of free and clear cash at the parent company. If we achieve our earnings guidance for the year, we can project we project to extract approximately $500 million of ordinary dividends from our operating subs. That could be higher if we're able to get extraordinary dividends. Bear in mind, we have a $500 million untapped revolver. And in connection with this transaction, we topped up that revolver with a short-term facility of an additional $400 million. So to recap, $840 million of cash, our projection of extracting at least $500 million of ordinary dividends during the balance of 2020 and then two untapped facilities which aggregate to $900 million of debt capacity. I'll also remind the group that our high-yield debt is trading really well right now. And that we believe we have really good access to the high-yield market if we wanted to make any of this financing permanent. So that's the cash flow story. Sure, Scott. There actually is an embedded growth rate in the acquired portfolio itself. The Arizona full-service Medicaid contract is at its very early stages. If I remember correctly, about 13,000 members at the end of the year with approximately $80 million in revenue. That's projected to achieve a membership of 75,000 to 80,000 over the next year. Because it enjoys a preferred position in the auto assignment algorithm in the state. So there's an inherent growth rate due to the Arizona property. And the point the second point you make is spot on. As you know, our strategy is to take our full product line and penetrate it into our Medicaid footprint. And now that we have a new Medicaid footprint in Arizona and in Virginia, we absolutely plan to launch a DSNP product in our Marketplace product in those geographies. And then, of course, just being in the boroughs in Westchester in New York city, gives you plenty of opportunities to look for bolt-on other bolt-on opportunities in the city and to perhaps grow the business. As you know, right now, we're in upstate New York. And don't have a produce in downstate New York. But this gives us plenty of opportunity to think more broadly about how to participate in Metro New York. Sure. I'm going to break with tradition air a little bit. You tend not to talk about what's going on in the current quarter, but this is an unusual time. And the points you mentioned are really, really important to pretend what could happen to membership. First thing I would point to is before talking about April, for the first time in many, many quarters, maybe even since I got here, we actually had membership growth in Medicaid sequentially March 31 over the end of the year. Good growth in Washington, Michigan, held steady, good growth in Illinois, offset by some losses in Puerto Rico. So our efforts to work with providers to keep more members in the system and to bring on more members are pushed to make sure that in the redetermination and re-eligibility process that we hold on to more members is starting to work. Pushing that forward now to the direct question you asked, it's even looking better in April. Our Medicaid membership is likely to be up over 30,000 members just in the month of April. And the interesting point I will make is we believe we're pretty sure that none of that membership arrived as a result of accelerated in the surge in unemployment. It's too soon to see people that became unemployed in March, end up in managed Medicaid. So we believe that the 30,000 growth in April is truly due to the suspension of eligibility of determination in the states. And without that churn, you're just not going to lose the members. They stay longer, they stick longer. And as you know, many states actually have suspended redetermination, and some have even announced perhaps even for a full year. So that really sort of pretends well for the membership growth before the surge due to unemployment actually arrived, which is likely to in May and beyond. Does that help? Yes, we have various views on it. I mean I think basically, and I think it's generally you say that if somebody needs insurance, they buy it. And if they don't, they won't. So there's just sort of an inherent bias, adverse selection bias in the whole process. We actually have various scenarios, some of which might say that there's higher acuity coming in through membership and some say that it will be on par with what we have. It's hard to say and where the number is coming from. Are they coming from a very rich self-insured plan and a big company? Or are they coming from a small group plan for a small business? So it's really hard to say right now, which is obviously one of the reasons why we're reluctant to predict what this surgeon membership brings. We'll see a surge on membership. We have to build the operational platforms and hire the people to service that membership and then as you suggested, the acuity of that membership is unknown. But I think the prevailing wisdom is, while it might be slightly better and worse than the average, that's not going to be a significant factor in taking on these members. If understand your question correctly. The two factors that we updated in our guidance are one that's sort of easy to understand and engage. And that is our portfolio is going to roll over into lower-yielding investments. It's irrefutable and already happening. And I think Tom pitched that as a $27 earnings per share $0.27 earnings per share headwind in our guidance. We also believe putting the accelerated membership aside that we will incur higher SG&A related to COVID operational protocols, financial assistance to our employees, etc, which also we factored into our the reaffirmation of our guidance, but we did not update for anything else. No. It's basically just saying the production of core earnings just got a little better, but we did not factor in any of those COVID-19 impacts. But yes, with those headwinds, we're saying core earnings gets a little stronger. Yes, Gary, that's my understanding. And there's very few adjustments like in the Marketplace MLR where taxes and all these other factors create a dramatic difference between the regulatory minimum and what you publish in your financials. But yes, seven of our 14 states have some form of MLR floor, ranging from 85% to 86%, except Puerto Rico, which is 92%. Those also exist in the expansion population and exist in the ABD business, but usually at different rates. So yes, there are very few adjustments from what you publish, and the minimum. And by understanding is they work on a one year fiscal year basis, not a rolling basis. No, it's actually not that complicated. Again, 1,000 cases, so you can't draw any statistical credibility to that. We have five day stays, and we have one month stays. We have people in the ICU on ventilators and people that go in and go out. Cost range from $10,000 per episode to $100,000 per episode. But we're now capturing all the codes. And I think while Tom was suggesting in his prepared remarks was early in the quarter we are getting tagged with all types of respiratory elements, particularly in Washington and California. This was before COVID was a phenomenon. And we've hindsight and better information now, we have attributed that, and it has been attributed to COVID-19 actually showing up in Washington and California far before anybody actually thought it was. But no, there's no intrigue around how we're getting billed and coded for these things with only 1,000 data points, as I said, it's hard to draw any statistical conclusions. On your other point, we are not seeing any dramatic change in the administrative aspects of our provider dealings. We are seeing a drop in pre-authorizations, and claim submissions just because of the elected procedure deferrals. But there has not been a huge disruption in either the level of payments and the level of submissions that we've observed to date, that could change here over the next couple of months. Sure. Well, Matt, all of you have seen all of the different pundits and think tanks project what this might look like with unemployment scenarios ranging from 10%, 20%, even up to 30% with Medicaid roles expanding anywhere from 10 million to 30 million members. A very wide range of results. I think as we said in our prepared remarks, there are lots of factors to consider here. Number one, COBRA used to be a rather significant factor in how many members would come in. But now with subsidized Marketplace, you could argue that there will be more members attracted to the subsidized Marketplace which might be the 102% of premium that COBRA charges. So there's all types of phenomenon. Even on the unemployment rate, we have to look at subsectors of the economy. We're looking at the lower wage service economy. And I believe that's not going to come back quickly. That sandwich shop, that drycleaner shop, that coffee shop, these small businesses are going to struggle to get back into business. And we think that the lower-wages service economy will remain have higher unemployment rates for a longer period of time than perhaps the higher-wage sector of the economy. So if you take our market share, if you do a projection of unemployment in all of our states, ranging from 10% to 20%, look at our market shares, in Washington, it's 50%. In most states, it ranges from 5% to 25%, 9% on average. You can actually craft a scenario where the membership peaks at a pretty significant number. As unemployment softens, some of that goes back. But I think there's a permanent delta here on that lower-end service economy that's going to struggle to get back into business quickly. It's a good question. I say during the all the swirl and the activity around this, I hadn't given that much thought. But the way we look at it is we now do have a product suite that works all the way up to 400% of federal poverty level when you think about it. So when we have Medicaid expansion in a variety of states, up to 138 then we have a highly subsidized Marketplace up into the 200, 250 range. We have products that the population can buy all the way up to that level. And so it would seem that we have the product suite, both commercial and government-sponsored that we need to satisfy the population. I hadn't given your specific question, a lot of thought during all this, but I will do so and get back to you on that. You're welcome. Right. We are seeing, I'd say, at this early stage, given that April data I was speaking about, we haven't seen Marketplace growth yet. But we have seen a slowing in the natural attrition rate. As we said at the beginning of the year when we gave our Marketplace forecast, we have reduced our attrition rate outlook to 1%, 1.5% a month. Which would suggest 3,000 to 4,500 members, that is slowing. We believe membership will start growing again here very soon. The point I was making before, I think, is the important one. Is that COBRA charges 102% of the full premium? And we believe, based on all the models we've looked at, that a highly or even reasonably sized subsidy in the Marketplace products, silver product, let's say, beats 102% of commercial all the time. And so we're likely to see more uptake in the Marketplace than maybe in past recessions when the Marketplace actually didn't exist. So now that it does exist, I think it's going to be the net beneficiary of folks who come out of commercial plans. And find that highly subsidized Marketplace product beat staying on COBRA. Well, I think that's an excellent point. Generally speaking, if you're in the middle of some kind of expensive treatment protocol or our chronic member on expensive drugs, you just don't move because you're happy with what you have. But as you know, COBRA has unlimited life, and those members have to go somewhere eventually. Right now, we're not assuming anything other than we're building the infrastructure to make sure we can handle the influx of members. Jason Dees, who runs our Marketplace business, is very mindful of how do we capture really risk scores and risk profile in these members. So we know when we get them, how to treat them, how to get them into care plans, etc. So very early stages. I don't have any more thought on it than what I just gave you. I'm not sure I understand are you referring to a Medicaid? And I'm not sure what you're referring to exactly, Josh. I think it's possible. I will answer the question more broadly. Most of our state customers are very concerned with the viability of various aspects of the medical communities in their states. And whether it's going to be enhancements to the fee schedule request, as you've seen, to pay claims faster, in some cases, even advanced payments to small providers, they are very focused on the health of the provider system. But we have not seen yet, from what I've been exposed to, any major changes to fee schedules. But there are many conversations ongoing about how to keep the providers funded during this entire process. I think the first thing I would say, Sarah, is we put a lot of faith in the concept of actuarial soundness, there's ebbs and flows. There's constant tension when benefits are carved in, when the benefits are carved out, when new populations are attempted to be capitated. There's a constant ebb and flow. And the only point we are making is if from a business model perspective, you would expect that in very strong economies when tax revenues are flowing, that rates would be on the strong side of actual soundness and the opposite could be true when tax revenues are down, in terms of recession. But the concept of actuarial soundness has proven in this industry. It's proven in the years that I've been here as testament to the margins that we're achieving. There are ebbs and flows. And all I'm suggesting is that in a recession, we could expect rates to be on the softer side of the actuarial soundness concept. But we still have not changed our outlook for our target margins, but a lot needs to be seen here in terms of what trend figures are going to be baked into the 2021 rates. Are we going to use normalized trends off of 2019? So when trend is inflecting the way it is, I think the bigger issue is when trend is inflecting up and down the way it is, how are the actuarial teams and our state customers and the actuarial teams of the managed care industry going to reconcile the various views of medical cost trend when we go to look at 2021 rates. But all that being said, I have a lot of faith and confidence in the actuarial soundness concept because it's actually worked well for managed Medicaid. Sure. The one aspect of managed care and medical cost in managed care that comes to mind in your specific question is related to pharmacy. As you know, that is commonly discussed as to either be carved in or carved out. As you probably saw in the New York state budgetary process that was just finalized they have suggested that at some point in the future, New York State could carve out pharmacy. Obviously, not terribly material for us with a $200 million business there, but carving in and carving out is actually, in my view, more of a question of how much rate how much capitated rate do they put in or take out. We'd rather see it bundled into the full capitation and have more revenue. But if it's carved out, it's if they carve out on an unsubsidized basis, you lose your 2% margin on what's carved out and that's it. So you just you hope through the negotiating process that the proper amount of capitated rate is either carved in or carved out. That's the issue, in my opinion. Interesting question. I think most of the investment banking community would tell you that in the past couple of weeks or months, that many of in-flight processes have stalled. This one's been going on for some time. And so it was able to get done with great cooperation from the guys from Magellan, and the teams worked well together. It's hard to say. I think this business is a tough business. And we look at some of the smaller players, the not for profits, the single state players, it's hard to get the operating leverage, the scale, the clinical resources you need to actually do a good job. It's just a tough business. But when this is all you do, and you have 3.5 million members and $20 billion of revenue, we certainly have the investable base, the skills and resources to be well here. So buying underperforming properties at 30% of revenue, getting the EBITDA margins up to 6%, 6.5%, that is a great use of our resources and our skills. Particularly when they're funded with cash that's generated from core operations, and we don't have to go to the equity markets or even the debt markets to fund them. So here in the foreseeable future. Obviously, we're going to be working on the regulatory process with Magellan, then we'll be integrating it. But we're still going to look for these single area bolt-on, tuck-in opportunities like the YourCare acquisition, which is fabulous for us. We're going to continue to look for them because we actually have the cash flow to action on them if they're actionable. Thanks for the question. It's look, it's a challenge. We moved 6,000 people from working in office to working at home. There are, as I said, hundreds of requests we're getting from regulators every day to do certain things. That requires you have to reconfigure your provider contracts. I mean the operating protocols and the amount of operational change that we're going through right now and dealing with all this is significant. But in New York, our business is in upstate New York, which is not the epicenter of COVID, but certainly is being impacted. The MLTSS business in New York is a good business. We managed $2 billion of LTSS benefits nationwide. I think we're the largest or the second largest manager of LTSS benefits. So it fits nicely with the portfolio. It's really it's not a medical business, per se. It's a business where we cater to the activities of daily living to pretty complex members under the Medicaid program. But it's a good business. It's got seven over $700 million in revenue. It's reasonably profitable. We think we can enhance the profitability by managing the hours more effectively. But COVID-19 was certainly a consideration as we actioned it. But we're either COVID-19 will either have abated by the time we own it or be so well understood and well managed, that it will be the new normal. So it was a consideration, but it did not deter us from wanting that property and including it in the purchase. It's a very good point. I will expect in the question, I will reiterate that our strategy hasn't changed. We had committed to growing the pool of profits of the exchange business. And had articulated that we will make the local geographic call as to where to push price for gaining membership and where it ease on or where to push price to gain members push price down to game membership, and we're ease up on it to gain margin and make local decisions based on competitive forces. And obviously, as you suggested, and admittedly, we got the elasticity of demand equation long last year. The bigger issue for us. So the strategy hasn't changed. We're going to take the full profits and attempt to grow it over time at reasonable margins. The rent that's been thrown into the works, obviously, is coded. Right now, as we sit here today, we're developing the pricing model for 2021. They're off of the 2019 baseline, which is pure of COVID. But the question will really be, what type of rates go into the market for 2021, given the COVID environment that we're in right now? So our belief is that in discussions with regulators, allowances will be made for maybe some later rate filings, maybe rate filings that include COVID and others that don't. Allow us to see more so that we can take a reasonable view of medical cost trend, getting into the rate so that we're not guessing, and the industry is not guessing. We don't want to push so much rate into the market that we have excess margins, and we certainly don't want to undercut it to where margins are too low. We want to get it right. So we're working with the regulators right now on the pricing regimen for 2021. Our leverage position is very strong, and I would encourage people not to look at our debt to total cap, which averages 40% to 45%, I think, it's 46% at the end of the quarter. Because that generally just sounds high to people. Our debt-to-EBITDA coverage is 1:1. Our leverage is 1:1. Our fixed interest cost coverage is like three weeks of earnings. We've covered our fixed charges and interest. So we're actually underlevered from a cash flow perspective. Having said that, in this environment, you always want to be more liquid than you otherwise would, but with $840 million of cash, $500 million of dividends expected this year, $900 million of untapped facilities, we believe we still have enough cash and enough liquidity cushion that have another bolt-on acquisition opportunity came up this month, next month or next quarter, we'd be able to action it. But in this environment, you want to be a little more liquid than normal. We usually target $100 million of parent company cash as a floor, and we'd probably think slightly higher than that in this environment Well, without getting into the process because that's we don't really want to do that. But the point what we wanted to make was that this efforts or long predated coped when the process started. And that was the only point we're really making. But willing buyer, willing seller, it's hard. There's a lot of properties out there, and many of them aren't actionable. But getting something that strategically fits from a product and geography perspective, and then one that's actionable is hard work. We have an expert M&A group, led by Mark Keim and a great team of people who are scanning the universe for actionable opportunities that fit with the portfolio and that are actionable. And last year, we found YourCare, we found NextLevel, but we obviously terminated our agreement with the NextLevel for very good reasons. And then this opportunity came into the market, and we worked it really, really hard with great cooperation from the folks from Magellan. There are others in the pipeline. I can't mention what they are and where they are, but there are still properties out there that are actionable, and we still have the liquidity and the resources to action them if, in fact, they come to market and can be actioned. Sure. It's hard to draw any conclusions from two weeks in March, but we certainly could draw conclusions from the full month of April. On the outpatient and professional services side, outpatient and ambulatory surgeries, depending on the geography line of business, pre authorization requests and notifications down 30% to 50%. Diagnostic testing and imaging, another sort of elective category, 40% to 45% PCP referrals to specialists, DNA, all down significantly over comparable periods. We're a seeing it on the inpatient side, particularly with elective surgeries and even in behavioral services. So in the medical cost categories that tend to be elective and discretionary we're seeing pre authorization requests and notifications down significantly over comparable periods. The other point I would make here is how long does this persist? There are various mandates of the suspension of elective procedures. That can't be done under either state authority or governmental authority that will end soon at some point. But there will be a contagion of fear of patient fear of going into facilities for the risk of being infected. So how fast they rebound, how fast the boomerang effect and when they come back, is another factor and why predicting what medical costs look like here over the next three to six months is difficult. I remind everyone, when we're talking about the rebound factor is there's a capacity limitation on how fast things can rebound. There are only so many beds. There are only so many doctors, and there's only so many hours in a day. And when you have three, four, five or even six months of pent-up demand, it cannot race through the pipe that quickly. There's a capacity limitation on how fast it rebounds, which adds another variable into forecasting how quickly this could rebound. So I hope that helps, but that's sort of a view of what March and April looked like from an elective and discretionary procedure outlook. We've been told that actually, we were told month of May, but we wanted to just open it up in the second quarter because we just weren't sure. But we've actually originally, they actually posted that they were going to do it in April and then due to COVID-19, they actually then pushed it. And whether it's actually published in writing or they made an announcement, I can't recall. But they did say May, but we sort of opened it up and said sometime in the second quarter. So we haven't heard about a suspension. And until we hear otherwise, we still expect the second quarter announcement. The first thing I would say to that is in our company, our Telehealth solution is more fully implemented in our Marketplace product than it is in our Medicaid product. It is beginning to be rolled out in our Medicaid product. And obviously, this accelerated the rollout because it was the right thing to do and members couldn't get in person visits. As we said in our prepared remarks, we created a parity mechanism between in-person visits and Telehealth visits. But I wouldn't want to say how it's priced, but it's more penetrated as we're searching for in our Marketplace book, than our Medicaid book. And we have a contract, we pay for it, and it's loaded in the benefit, is really all I can say. Well, generally, in Medicaid, the members are not paying anything out of pocket for any service. So in Medicaid, the answer is no. And I believe I'll project this and get back to you. But in Marketplace, it's probably like any other claim payment. If somebody's decided they're deductible, it gets treated that way. If there's a co-pay whatever the benefit plan is, I think it gets treated just like another claim pursuant to the benefit structure of the contract. Thank you."

Joe?\nJoe Zubretsky: Thank you, Joe and good morning. Today, we will provide updates on several topics; our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021, our initial 2022 revenue and earnings guidance, and our growth initiatives and reaffirmation of our sustaining profitable growth strategy.  Let me start with the fourth quarter highlights. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of $2.88 with adjusted net income of $170 million and premium revenue of $7.2 billion, an increase of 48% over the prior year. The 88.8% consolidated medical care ratio demonstrates solid performance while managing through pandemic-related challenges. The net effect of COVID increased our consolidated medical care ratio by 150 basis points, decreasing net income per diluted share by approximately $1.50, which is $0.50 more than previously expected.  We managed to 7.4% adjusted G&A ratio, reflecting continued discipline and cost management while making the appropriate investments in our business to fuel growth. We produced an adjusted after tax margin of 2.3%. Excluding the net effect of COVID, our adjusted after tax margin was 3.5%, squarely in line with our long-term target.  We are very pleased with our fourth quarter performance with respect to both the delivery of solid earnings and the focused execution of our profitable growth strategy. The quarter marks the end of yet another very successful year, a year in which we continue to produce a high level of financial performance while navigating the effects of a global pandemic. We executed well and sustained solid operating margins, while driving significant revenue growth.  Now, turning to full year highlight, we reported full year 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $13.54, a 6% increase over initial full year guidance. We absorbed $3.50 of cost related to the net effect of COVID, which was $2 higher than initial guidance, implying $2.80 of improved underlying performance. Excluding the net effect of COVID, our after tax margin was 3.6%, consistent with our long-term target. We generated premium revenue of $26.9 billion, an increase of 47% over our full year 2020 premium revenue and $3.9 billion above our initial 2021 guidance. This strong premium revenue growth was well-balanced between organic growth and bolt on acquisition and is a testament to our successful transition to sustain profitable growth.  From a membership perspective, we ended the year with 5.2 million members, a 1.2 million member increase year-over-year. Notably, this 29% growth across all three segments was enhanced by the suspension of Medicaid redetermination and the special enrollment period in marketplace.  Turning now to our full year performance highlights by line of business. Medicaid, our flagship business, representing 76% of total company premium, produced strong premium revenue growth and stable earnings, as we continue to execute on the underlying fundamentals. For the full year, our Medicaid business achieved a medical care ratio of 88.7% consistent with our long-term MCR target, as moderate net effective COVID was offset by strong medical cost management.  For the year, our diversified portfolio state contracts performed well across all dimensions. Underlying medical costs trend was stable and well controlled, particularly within our growing population of high acuity members, while we continued to deliver high quality care. The right environment was stable and risk sharing corridors recaptured some of our outperformance but many already have been and will continue to be eliminated. For the year, our Medicare medical care ratio was 87.2%, a very strong result, squarely in line with our long-term target range and demonstrating our ability to clinically and financially manage the high acuity members in both our D-SNP and MMP program. This line of business plays an important role in the portfolio, as each year over 30,000 of our Medicaid members turn age 65.  Our marketplace medical care ratio for the full year was 86.9%, well above our long-term target. This reflects the significant cost related the net effect of COVID in our largest geographies, and the high cost impact of the adverse selection related the special enrollment period. Approximately 300,000 members were attracted to our product during this special enrollment period, accounting for 25% of full year marketplace member month. All told, our marketplace performance has been a disappointment. Later, Mark will summarize the steps we have taken in the environmental factors, which will allow us to restore margin to our mid-single digit target in 2022.  You will hear that included in our revenue guidance is a planned reduction in marketplace membership and a related 38% decrease in 2022 marketplace revenue. However, we expect this repositioning of our product to be significantly accretive to 2022 earnings and establish a strong foundation for this business going forward.  2021 was also a very successful year across multiple dimensions of our profitable growth strategy. Specifically, we successfully re-procured our Ohio Medicaid contract, and were awarded a new state contract in Nevada, validating our ability to retain existing state contracts, as well as win new business in new states.  Our M&A engine continued to execute at a high level. During the year, we announced two new acquisition, Cigna\u2019s Texas Medicaid business and AgeWell in New York, for combined premium revenue of approximately $1.7 billion. In October, we closed the New York-based Affinity acquisition, adding over 300,000 members and approximately $1.6 billion of annual premium revenue. And we successfully integrated three previously closed acquisitions representing approximately $5 billion in annual revenue, which continued to provide earnings accretion.  In summary, our full year 2021 enterprise results continue to demonstrate our ability to produce excellent margin, while growing premium revenue and successfully managing through the ongoing clinical and financial impacts of the pandemic.  Turning to our 2022 guidance, beginning with premium revenue; we are very pleased with the continued success of our profitable growth strategy. In 2022, we project premium revenue of approximately $28.5 billion, a 6% year-over-year increase on a reported basis and 14% growth before the effect of regulatory headwinds and the planned decline in marketplace revenue. This is consistent with the initial outlook provided on our third quarter 2021 earnings call. This growth is well-balanced between the new contract win, organic growth in our current footprint and the full annual run rate of our recent acquisition. Incremental to our revenue guidance will be the AgeWell acquisition when closed and any further extension of the public health emergency and the resulting suspension in Medicaid Redeterminations beyond April.  Moving to earnings guidance, our initial full year 2022 adjusted earnings guidance per share is no less than $17 or 26% growth year-over-year. We project a 3.4% adjusted after tax margin, consistent with our long-term target. Our 2022 earnings profile reflects durable and sustainable operating improvement and earnings growth. Included in our 2022 guidance is the realization of $3.50 per share of our 2021 embedded earnings power and additional organic earnings growth, partially offset by the effects of regulatory headwinds. With COVID still providing $2 of earnings per share pressure in 2022 and a few of our acquisition integration not yet fully matured, we still have embedded earnings power remaining to support future earnings growth.  In summary, our 2022 guidance features premium revenue growth of 14% before regulatory headwinds in the marketplace reset and strong earnings per share growth of 26% with key operating and margin metrics squarely in line with the long-term targets we shared at our September 2021 investor conference.  I will now provide a few concluding comments that frame our profitable growth strategy. We remain committed to staying close to the core. We intend to remain a pure play government managed care business, which has very attractive growth characteristics, demographically, and politically. We aspire to provide high quality care to our members, while driving to the lowest cost of delivery to produce attractive margin. We believe we have the right strategy and the right team to execute it. Our strong finish to 2021 and our 2022 guidance position us well and give us great confidence, we can achieve our long-term target of 13% to 15% premium revenue growth and 15% to 18% earnings per share growth on average over time.  As I conclude my remarks, I want to express my gratitude to our management team and our nearly 14,000 Molina colleagues. Their skill, dedication, and steadfast service continued to form the foundation for everything we have achieved, and everything we will achieve in the years to come.  With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials and 2022 guidance. Mark?\nMark Keim: Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. This morning I will discuss some additional details of our fourth quarter and full year performance. I will then turn to the balance sheet and some thoughts on our 2022 guidance. Beginning with our fourth quarter results by segment. In Medicaid, we reported an 88.3% MCR, a strong result that included continuation of costs from the net effect of COVID, offset by strong medical cost management. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 88.3%. During the quarter, the emergence of the Omicron variant had a greater impact on our Medicare population than on our other segments. Focused medical cost management and better than expected risk adjustment offset the net effect of COVID in the quarter.  In marketplace, reported MCR was 92.1%. While COVID infection rates in our marketplace population declined from the peak of the Delta variant in August, the net effect of COVID continued to pressure results in the fourth quarter. The Special Enrollment Period membership, which grew to almost 40% of our marketplace book in the quarter, also contributed to the elevated marketplace MCR.  Turning to full year results, our full year consolidated MCR was 88.3%. This result is modestly above our long-term target, as strong performance in our Medicaid and Medicare businesses was offset by the performance of our marketplace business. Specifically, our full year Medicaid MCR was 88.7%, in line with our 88% to 89% long-term target. Our full year Medicare MCR was 87.2%, in line with our 87% to 88% long-term target. In both Medicaid and Medicare, strong medical cost management, offset the net effect of COVID. Our full year marketplace MCR of 86.9% is well above our 78% to 80% long-term target, and includes approximately 430 basis points of the net effect of COVID as well as approximately 360 basis points from the impact of the Special Enrollment Period.  Turning now to our balance sheet, our capital foundation remains strong. We harvested $218 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, which brought our year end 2021 parent company cash balance the 348 million. Debt at the end of the quarter is 2.1 times trailing 12 months EBITDA. Our debt-to-total cap ratio is 47.8%. However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.8 times and 43.9% respectively. These metrics reflect the conservative leverage position, and ample cash capacity for additional growth and investment.  During the quarter, we redeemed our senior notes due 2022 using the proceeds of our November debt offering of notes due 2032. This refinancing will lower our total interest expense by 50 basis points, and extend our debt maturity towers to 2028 to 2032. More importantly, the transaction marks the final step in our capital restructuring strategy. We have eliminated the costly convertible bonds and addressed all near term maturities at coupon rates well below similarly rated issuers.  Turning to reserves, our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and we continue to be confident in our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter represented 51 days of medical costs expense, an increase of two days sequentially.  Now turning to guidance, beginning with membership. We ended 2021 with approximately 4.3 million Medicaid members. As discussed, our 2022 guidance reflects the resumption of redeterminations, which we expect will more than offset Medicaid growth drivers and result in 2022 year end membership of approximately 4.1 million members. In Medicare, we ended 2021 with 142,000 members. We expect year end 2022 total Medicare membership of approximately 150,000 members. This reflects strong AEP growth in our MAPD and D-SNP products and the addition of members from our Cigna Texas Medicaid acquisition.  In marketplace, we ended 2021 with 728,000 members. Based on open enrollment, we expect to begin 2022 with approximately 320,000 members, reflecting our strategy to achieve target margins in this business for 2022. Accounting for a limited SEP and normal levels of attrition through the year, we expect to end 2022 with approximately 250,000 members.  Turning now to premium revenue guidance. We expect premium revenue of approximately $28.5 billion or 6% growth. Excluding regulatory headwinds and our marketplace reset, this represents 14% growth over 2021. Specifically, our premium revenue guidance includes the following growth drivers; a full year of the acquired Affinity business, which closed October 25, and the Cigna Texas Medicaid business, which closed on January 1 for a combined $2.2 billion, approximately $1.1 billion of organic Medicaid and Medicare growth in our current footprint, and approximately $400 million for the Nevada Medicaid contract, which began on January 1. Partially offsetting these growth drivers are several headwinds to 2022 revenue growth; 1.2 billion of lower marketplace premium revenue, reflecting our strategy to restore target margins in this business, approximately 400 million related to the resumption of redeterminations, and 500 million from the carve out of pharmacy benefits in our California and Ohio Medicaid contracts.  Consistent with past practice, AgeWell is excluded from our 2022 guidance. We continue to expect this acquisition to close in the third quarter of this year, and will provide $200 million or more of additional premium revenue in 2022 when closed.  Turning now to earnings guidance. We introduced our initial full year 2022 adjusted earnings guidance of no less than $17 per share, reflecting 26% growth over 2021. Our EPS guidance reflects the realization of approximately $3.50 per share of 2021 embedded earnings consisting of approximately $1.50 per share of lower net effective COVID, roughly $0.50 per share for improvement in Medicare risk adjustment, approximately $1 per share, as we attain target margins in Magellan Complete Care and Passport and approximately $0.50 per share for the recently closed Affinity and Cigna Texas Medicaid acquisition.  Our 2022 guidance also includes approximately $0.80 per share of marketplace margin improvement not captured in the lower net effect of COVID. This is offset by the net impact of organic earnings growth and the resumption of redeterminations and the previously discussed pharmacy benefit carve outs. The restoration of marketplace margins to mid-single digits in 2022 will be accomplished through actions already taken. Specifically, we price to a higher medical cost trend, anticipating a more moderate COVID and SEP impact. We redesigned our product offerings, focusing on the silver tier in response to the increase member premium subsidies. Based on recently concluded open enrollment period, we expect to have a higher percentage of renewing members. We also expect a lower mix of special enrollment membership in 2022, based on the revised eligibility rules and our revised product design and distribution strategies. We expect many of these changes will also improve our risk adjustment results.  Moving on to select P&L guidance metrics. We expect our medical care ratio to be approximately 88%. The MCR improvement over 2021 is primarily due to lower net effect of COVID, our actions to improve marketplace performance in 2022, continued progress in medical cost management in our legacy and acquired businesses, and improvement in Medicare risk scores. We expect our adjusted G&A ratio to improve to 6.8%. This reflects discipline cost management, fixed costs leveraged from our revenue growth and mix, offset by continued investment in growth and capabilities. The effective tax rate is expected to be 25.4%. Adjusted after tax margin is expected to be 3.4%, consistent with our long-term targeted range. Weighted average share count is expected to remain flat at 58.4 million shares and we expect that just over 50% of our full year earnings will be produced in the first half of the year. As mentioned, our 2022 guidance includes the realization of $3.50 a share of 2021 embedded earnings, leaving approximately $2.50 a share of embedded earnings power in 2022, comprising the net effect of COVID of approximately $2 per share, which should continue to dissipate and approximately $1 per share, as we attain our target margins on closed deals, including Affinity, Cigna\u2019s Texas Medicaid business and our pending acquisition of AgeWell, partially offset by roughly $0.50 per share a projected Medicaid redetermination impact in 2023. As a reminder, this embedded earnings power does not represent 2023 guidance, but rather an accounting of drivers that are temporarily suppressing our earnings profile, and our current projection of the impact of Medicaid redeterminations post 2022.  This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America, please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay. Great. Thanks. I just wanted to ask about the exchange because that was a surprise for me in this guidance. Can you talk a little bit about how do you think about this business sustainably, just looking back and, I guess, over the last eight years, six of those years, you either grew that business by over 50% or you dropped that business by over 50% in a given year, so very volatile from year to year, it\u2019s hard to see kind of what the strategy is long term. How comfortable are you that this is actually a base that you can grow off of in that low to mid -- sorry, mid to high single digits picture forecasting long term. Thanks. \nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, Kevin. It is Joe. The strategic positioning of the business really hasn\u2019t changed. This is an adjunct to Medicaid. We serve the working poor, we leverage our Medicaid network, we leverage our Medicaid network pricing and our Medicaid footprint. So the strategy hasn\u2019t changed, 90% of our members are fully or partially subsidized. That is the market segment we are approaching. What you\u2019re observing this year is really a capital allocation decision. We never intended to have 728,000 members; that was a function of the Special Enrollment Period, which not only grew membership beyond what anybody expected, but added a significant element of adverse selection. Really what you\u2019re seeing this year is the repositioning of the product, as Mark suggested in his comments, from a pricing perspective, from a structural perspective, from a metallic tear perspective, and from a distribution perspective, to continue to target the working poor and to more emphasize the silver tier that is much easier to price to and to financially manage. So, this is a business where we\u2019re more focused on margin than we are on membership and we will let membership float up and down with our ability to obtain mid-single digit margin. Mark, anything to add?\nMark Keim: I think that\u2019s right, Joe. If you look back to 2020, we were about 318,000 members at the end of the year. 2021 probably would have looked a lot more like 2020, if it wasn\u2019t for the SEP that Joe talked about, which almost none of us in this space knew pretty much at this time last year. Backing out that SEP, 2021 would have looked a lot like 2020. Here we are in \u201822 with an outlook that\u2019s a lot like 2020 and 2021 before the SEP, so I think this level in our portfolio is about the right level, but as Joe mentioned, we will be entirely pricing for margin not for volume.\nKevin Fischbeck: You\u2019re not talking about increased competition or irrational pricing here. This is more of a company-specific decision. I just want to make sure I understand is this a market issue or is it just Molina\u2019s strategy.\nJoe Zubretsky: Our strategy is to focus on our Medicaid footprint and to capture individuals who at times income out of Medicaid and have a marketplace product to buy from us at zero premium. That\u2019s always been the strategy. And again, if you look back just a year ago, we\u2019re at 300,000 members and then of course the Special Enrollment Period, added 20,000 to 40,000 members a month while coming on to the to the marketplace roles at a higher acuity. So this is a capital allocation decision. It\u2019s a function of the SEP, it\u2019s a function of the pandemic, and we are comfortable with this business at roughly 7% to 8% of revenue, leveraging our Medicaid footprint, and we think our capital allocation is appropriate as we\u2019ve now repositioned the risk profile of this business.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Matt Borsch of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nArianna Brady: Good morning. This is Arianna Brady on for Matt Borsch. I was wondering if you could give more detail on the expected timing of the Medicaid redetermination and how much certainty and visibility you have around the process? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure. With the public health emergency now having been extended to April, given the notification periods that are required, the first members will not be re-determining, reestablishing eligibility until July 1. We estimate that given that we grew organically, approximately 750,000 members, since the beginning of a pandemic, that equates to approximately $2.9 billion of revenue. We believe that $2.9 billion of revenue will decrease by 1.3 billion to a $1.6 billion residual target and that will happen partially over 2022 and then partially over 2023. Mark, you want to go through the numbers.\nMark Keim: Yeah, just to build on that. So that\u2019s a 1.3 billion decline over time but that\u2019s going to happen over a couple of years. So in my prepared remarks, I mentioned 400 million impacting our 2022 outlook, and the additional 900 million in \u201823. So our target was expectation that we would keep half of these members gain since the start of the pandemic. They\u2019ll come off over time per the public health emergency, and the revenue impacts across the two years are as I mentioned.\nArianna Brady: Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Next question is from Nathan Rich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. I wanted to follow up on the member attrition in marketplace. I guess I\u2019m just trying to think about the 475,000 member decline for 2022 and how that\u2019s balanced between member attrition, potentially due to SEP and maybe the adverse selection that you mentioned, I think, the 300,000 that you saw sign up during that period and any competitive factors that you may have seen in the in the market. And Mark, maybe could help us think about how much marketplace margins were impacted by that adverse selection dynamic in 2021, as we think about where kind of marketplace margins ended the year and the improvement that\u2019s contemplated to get to mid-single digit margins for 2022.\nJoe Zubretsky: Well, first on the membership and revenue question, what\u2019s interesting and should be noted, that although membership is down by over 60%, revenue is down by less than 40% because we shifted the book to the silver tier, the silver tier has a much richer product design and therefore revenue flow. So the PMPM revenue on silver is much higher. So the operating leverage is very positive. With respect to the margin, we are very confident on a return to mid-single digit. This produced -- this business -- due to the SEP and a pandemic, this business produced a low-single digit margin loss on $3 billion of revenue in 2021. We expect now to return that to a mid-single digit margin gain on $2 billion of revenue in 2022. So, sort of a seven to eight point increase in margins, a lot of it due to the elimination of the COVID pandemic, and much of it also due to the adverse selection that the SEP produced. Mark, the numbers?\nMark Keim: Yeah, absolutely. So if you look at our membership, as you point out, we\u2019re down some 60% end of \u201821 versus \u201822 but as Joe mentioned, our revenues in marketplace are down 38%. Why the disconnect? Within our new membership is a very different mix of bronze versus silver. Last year, 2021, we had about 41% of our portfolio in bronze, that\u2019ll be down to 15% in 2022. As I\u2019m sure you know the PMPM, the revenue PMPMs are quite different between bronze and silver, they\u2019re about 300 in bronze, and about 550 in silver on average across the portfolio. So that kind of offsets a lot of the volume decline, just on higher PMPMs on those members.  Now on the margins, Joe mentioned last year it\u2019s 86.9 MCR but we\u2019re tracking this year to a 79, which is smack in the middle of our long-term guidance for marketplace MLR. A couple of things that bridges from last year two this year, obviously, we took significant pricing, as we looked into the New Year. Your specific question around what did SEP and COVID cost us? I think we mentioned at a high level in our prepared remarks, we carried across marketplace 430 basis points of COVID last year and 360 basis points from the SEP. So you put those two together that\u2019s 8% of headwind that I\u2019m not expecting in the New Year. COVID, we all have a more optimistic outlook for COVID in the New Year and SEP, the market will be behaved differently this year, the regulations are different, pure people can sign up and our distribution strategy puts us in a different place, I just don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have that exposure. So you get the 8% pricing coming into the New Year. You remove that headwind of COVID and SEP throw a trend assumption on there for what a normalized trend assumption could be and you have a very clear path to that high 70%, 79% MLR I\u2019m talking about.\nNathan Rich: Thanks. Appreciate the detail. \nOperator: The next question is from Stephen Baxter of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nStephen Baxter: Hi. Thanks for the updated view on earnings power. I guess just, first, appreciated actions were required on the exchange business. I guess, how should we think about the foregone membership there is impacting the earnings power dynamics you\u2019ve talked about through 2021? It seems like, in aggregate you\u2019re kind of at the same ballpark as you were before, just trying to make sure I can follow that. And then second, just sort of appreciate if you could provide a little more detail on what\u2019s still in the $2 of COVID pressure at this point. It sounds like maybe you\u2019re getting back $0.50 of the dollar per scores, maybe that\u2019s half -- or excuse me a quarter of it. But we think about the balance, it sounds like you\u2019re saying that all three businesses, I think, will be roughly a target margins. Just trying to understand where you feel like the opportunity still is. Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, Stephen. You mentioned the embedded earnings power, which is not a theoretical construct, we didn\u2019t construct it in the abstract, it\u2019s real. And as we previously disclosed, sitting on top of our $13.50 actual results for 2021, about $6.50 was embedded earnings power. Clearly, with the significant impact of the pandemic, was something reasonable to account for. And because we\u2019ve been so acquisitive, we thought it was also helpful to account for the growing accretion of our closed acquisition. So sitting on top of our $13.50 results in \u201821 was an additional $6.50 in embedded earnings. We have harvested $3.50 of that embedded earnings inside our $17 -- at least $17 plan for 2022. Also, as you suggested, sitting on top of the $17 is an additional $2.50 of continued embedded earnings power, due to the net effect of COVID, due to the Affinity and Cigna Texas acquisitions, which are new to the portfolio and AgeWell will add a little bit as well. So it\u2019s a real construct, the Embedded earnings have been harvested inside the 2022 plan, and some still exists to add to future earnings growth here over time.  And the net effect is COVID, we account for three things. We account for the direct cost of COVID-related care, we attempt to estimate the effect of utilization curtailment due to the pandemic, and then we account for the effects of the corridor. As we previously suggested, the corridors were significant in 2021. We had nine of them that were financially significant that has been reduced to three for 2022. So they linger on into \u201822 in the state of Washington, Ohio, and Mississippi. We have every confidence when the PAHD [phonetic] ends, they too will be eliminated. But that\u2019s really what\u2019s in the $2 net effective COVID for 2022 are the lingering effects of three corridor. \nStephen Baxter: Thanks for color. \nOperator: The next question is from Michael Hall of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nMichael Hall: Hey, thank you guys. Appreciate the color on the exchanges, I understand you\u2019re pretty confident on double digit margin to appears but just wanted to clarify, so a large percent of these lives that were lost, basically, were very low to no margin, maybe even negative margin, so earnings impact was basically negligible. And looking forward, are you now at a place where the portfolio is fully right-sized, you\u2019re ready to charge ahead at 5% to 8% long-term growth a year?\nJoe Zubretsky: Yes. Just, again, some additional color, the answer is yes, that special enrollment membership ran at a very high loss ratio. In fact, the volume, it represented about 40% of the member month volume in the fourth quarter alone and 25% for the year; ran at 105% MCR in the fourth quarter and just about 100% for the full year. So that was a significant contribution to our issues this year. As Mark suggested, blend it over the entire year, it was 260 basis points of MCR pressure, so we expect that to completely reverse into next year. The business is positioned where it should have been, pre-SEP. As I said, we follow our Medicaid footprint, we sell to highly subsidized members. Now that we\u2019ve repositioned the mix to more silver than bronze, we have every confident that this is a solid baseline, mid-single digit margins, and probably mid to low single digit growth here over the foreseeable future.\nOperator: The next question is from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead. \nJosh Raskin: Thanks. Good morning. I\u2019ve got a bigger picture question around where Molina is in their sort of corporate life cycle. And obviously the turnaround, Joe, since you\u2019ve got there about four years ago, it\u2019s been much more successful than I think anyone expected and feels mainly driven by this big margin improvement and some opportunistic M&A. But it seems as though we\u2019re getting to a point where there are some top line headwinds, and it\u2019s sort of ebbing and flowing. And as you look over the next few years, I\u2019m curious about the plan to extract more value from that membership, not just the embedded earnings that you talked about, but real value over the long term. And are we at a point where scale and maybe other non-insurance-based capabilities become more important? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: It certainly is part of our strategic planning process to look at all opportunities for allocation of capital. And yes, we\u2019re well aware of the capability builds that happen in other companies, we\u2019re well aware of vertical integration with providers. We believe, for the foreseeable future, there is so much growth, both in the demographics, actual membership growth, particularly in the high acuity segment, that we don\u2019t have to look far beyond our ability to take capitated risks, particularly with high acuity members, manage it really well, be a rate taker in Medicaid, grow Medicare, and use this ballast of marketplace, as this residual mechanism, that we don\u2019t need to do much beyond that, to sustain the growth around. We never would have suggested a 13% to 15% revenue growth and 15% to 18% EPS growth by 2025, if we didn\u2019t see enough runway to continue growing the business and in the swim lanes we\u2019re in. So certainly in our strategic planning process, we always look at capability build, we are not going to allocate capital to vertically integrate with providers. For us, we do not think that\u2019s a good deployment of capital. But there\u2019s so much runway with the number of lives that will go managed and particularly the high acuity lives that we don\u2019t need to do much beyond that.\nJosh Raskin: Very helpful. Thanks. \nOperator: The next question is from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. \nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions here on the exchanges. First, Joe, going back to the third quarter, you had talked about exchange membership being flat to down. So you certainly indicated that there could be some pressure here, but the fact that flat was in the ballpark, potentially, right the 60% decline is certainly more than I think any of us expected. So I was hoping you could tell us a little bit more about what happened between the third quarter and today that so significantly changed the outlook for the exchanges, like did you cut commissions or something? Is there something structural that you did or is this just pie or turn? What can you tell?\nJoe Zubretsky: Well, certainly all the strategies that we were executing for 2022 were in place during the third quarter, they had to be, as we\u2019re going into open enrollment. Yes, membership is down but we withdrew in just about all of our markets the bronze product. Now, how many of those members were going to then take up a Molina-based silver product was a matter of estimation. Would I have hoped to end up with more membership if it was silver? Sure but 320,000 out of the gate is just fine. So as you take a complete product set off the shelf, except in three states where the circumstances are quite different, so basically pull it off the shelf, it was hard to know how much of that membership would have stayed in a Molina product with silver. But the good news is the members that we do have, most of them are renewal members, and 85% of them are silver. So irrespective of where we started and where we ended up, we\u2019re ending up in a really, really good place that portends well for the production of the mid-single digit margin.\nJustin Lake: Great. And then I\u2019d love to get your opinion on a couple of things. You talked about the impact of the Special Enrollment Period, both in margins and membership. I\u2019d love to hear your view on like, how sticky do you think that membership is, in terms of 2022, right, if we don\u2019t have those Special Enrollment Period, like what do you think happens with those members? Also, there\u2019s a lot of talk about the fact that with Medicaid redetermination, we could see a lot of those members move from Medicaid over to the exchanges. So, what do you think happens with those two things specifically? And then maybe you can give us your kind of view of what you think the marketplace is going to do in terms of enrollment overall, given all those different swing factors in 2022 versus 2021? Do you think it grows or shrinks?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure. Well, certainly. When insurance is available to you, anytime you need it, you buy it, and it should be no surprise that the effects of the adverse selection were significant. So the question then becomes, what happens to that cohort, a lot of the uptake during the special enrollment period was bronze. So to the extent that that product was one that was affordable, and no Molina bronze product was available, they either renewed with us into silver or didn\u2019t renew us at all. The other fact that\u2019s really important is if the acuity of the member didn\u2019t change, they\u2019re still high acuity, but now we still have them. The fact that we\u2019ve now had them for over a year means that we\u2019ll be able to capture risk scoring more appropriately and the fact that they\u2019re in silver means the risk score will count for more revenue. So the fact that some of these members renewed into the renewal book into 2022 is fine, the number is not very high, but now we have visibility into their acuity, we will be able to capture the risk score and at least earn a silver product.  Long term, my comments are going to really extend to our strategy, which is this is a high subsidy strategy to follow our Medicaid footprint. My view of this has always been and I\u2019m looking -- I was always looking for the right word, it\u2019s a residual market for Medicaid. As members get part time jobs and have an income level just above Medicaid, they\u2019re probably eligible for highly subsidized marketplace product. Our strategy has always been to target that market. Now, our execution has been less than perfect on that but that\u2019s always been the strategy. So this is going to grow with the working poor, with the Medicaid population as people flex up and down. So we think there, as we said, an Investor Day low-single digit growth rate, mid to -- I think it\u2019s 5% to 8%, I think is the right number. And we\u2019re confident that that\u2019s the way the business will grow with a yield that\u2019s probably half of that and membership growth that\u2019s another half of that. But it\u2019s a product that should flex up and down with Medicaid as the Medicaid rolls move up and down. \nMark Keim: And Justin, it is Mark. The only thing I\u2019d add to that is I think you asked about redetermination as well. As you know we have the projections for some revenue coming off and some members through redetermination, what we don\u2019t have is those members picked up in our marketplace product at the margins we expect to drive here that is all upside to our projections. But we have a meaningful effort out there to pick up the redetermination members in our marketplace and Medicare in some case products through cross sell, which has meaningful upside to the numbers we\u2019ve talked about today. \nJustin Lake: Right. Thanks. \nOperator: Your next question is from AJ Rice of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nAJ Rice: Hi, everybody. Let me just ask you about the Medicaid business. So can you comment on what the RFP pipeline looks like, where the opportunities are, where the defending requirements might be? And specifically, maybe comment on California that\u2019s been in the press lately with discussion about this idea with Kaiser Permanente. Do you think that\u2019s going to be a normal RFP process, from your perspective or are there nuances of difference? And I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve commented on your expectations for the \u201822 average composite rating crease across your state that you\u2019re seeing in Medicaid. And I wonder if I\u2019ve missed that or if you would give that.\nJoe Zubretsky: AJ, first, thanks for asking about Medicaid. It\u2019s obviously 80% of the revenue base and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the result that the Medicaid team produced in 2021 and the plan for \u201822. I mean, it\u2019s now a total of nearly $24 billion of revenue, $23 billion of premium revenue, and it\u2019s going to operate north of a 3% after tax margin. We continue to win new business. And yes, we do have to retain and defend our existing contracts, as you suggested. The California RFP was distributed just yesterday. We believe the Texas RFP will be distributed late in the first quarter and Mississippi is in the middle of a proposal writing effort, as we sit here today. Most of the other procurements are longer dated, but those are the three, we have a high confidence in all three of them. We run a really well run business in California, we have a great team. As you know, it\u2019s a pretty complex state with respect to how the region\u2019s work.  And yes, I think us and the rest of the managed care industry were disappointed that Kaiser was awarded a no bid contract but it\u2019s not as though it\u2019s some transformational event that\u2019s going to reshape the entire medical landscape, it\u2019s incremental. In fact, most of the impact will be in tooth plan regions where the local health plans have major share. So, high confidence in California, high confidence in Texas. In fact, we say that the fact that the regulatory process for the Cigna acquisition went so well, that it is testimony to the high regard the state holds us in with respect to the STAR+PLUS population.  With respect to new states, as you know, there\u2019s $108 billion pipeline over four to five years. We certainly won\u2019t chase every opportunity in every state. We are very selective as to where we think we can win evaluating a series of criteria. But our proposal writing team, our business development team, are extremely active, and to date have demonstrated a great deal of success with a Kentucky win and Nevada win and defending the Ohio contract. So the business is performing extremely well and at 80% of revenue, it needs to enhance and the outlook for growth, both organically and inorganically, is pretty robust.\nAJ Rice: Okay. Any thoughts on the rate increase for \u201822 on average?\nJoe Zubretsky: I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve given a specific percentage but the rate increase was low-single digit across in Medicaid across the book. We are comfortable with its actuarial soundness. It has generally kept pace with our view of normalized medical costs trend, which also was low-single digit. So the rate environment is stable. It\u2019s rational, the principle of actuarial soundness and the return to a prospective setting of rates based on a sound medical baseline and the removal of these corridors seems to be happening as quickly as we originally estimated. \nAJ Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. \nOperator: The next question is from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning, I guess two more interrelated questions on marketplace. You know, first, just with the drop off in membership by 65% from 728 to 250. As we think about the quarterly cadence around that, do you have any sense where that\u2019ll shake out at the end of the first quarter in particular? And then is it possible that the 250 year end number, maybe, it\u2019s just conservative around the progression around all this? And then the second question, maybe just ask it now to this kind of interrelated, with the 65% decline in membership, revenue is expected to decline 38%. As we think about the delta between those two numbers, how much of that is just driven by that shift from bronze to silver versus just premium increases, just trying to get a proxy for what drives the delta between that two, a little more color on that?\nJoe Zubretsky: Most of it is the shift from bronze to silver, which is a very significant differential in the PMPM revenues that those products generate. But we did go for it and attain a highest single digit rate increase in that business. In terms of where we start, and where we end, I think we said we started with 323 [phonetic] and 30,000 members, after the whole Annual Enrollment period. We are projecting pre-pandemic levels of attrition, which averaged 1.5% to 2% a month. Now, if that doesn\u2019t happen, we\u2019ll end up with more than 250,000 members by year end. We\u2019re also expecting not to pick up many members during Special Enrollment. As you know, the Special Enrollment Period still exists but the eligibility requirements have been significantly reduced to where only people at less than 150% of Federal Poverty Level income are eligible. So, if we \u2013 we won\u2019t pick up SEP members, we\u2019re confident in that and if attrition is at 1.5% to 2% a year, the 250,000 number by year end is about where we will end.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay, all right. Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Scott Fidel of Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just interested if you can give us your initial thoughts on the 2023 MA [phonetic] advance notice? And then just walk us through your capital priorities and how you think about capital appointment at GR in terms of M&A opportunity, buybacks, etc. Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure. Obviously, like the rest of the industry, we were pleased with the advanced notice, second year in a row that it looked very attractive on its surface. We\u2019ve grown our Medicare business, even though half of it is demonstrations, which likely won\u2019t grow, the other half is his marketing business and the DSNP product that will grow. And in the fact we are growing from 142,000 to 152,000 members is significant. So we\u2019re really happy with the growth characteristics of the business. We think two years straight of rate increases, give us a lot of room to put the right benefits in the product to rate it appropriately, and to win new business and have margins in the mid-single digit after tax territory where we\u2019re positioned today. So we\u2019re really bullish on our Medicare business and we have a great team that will grow that business here over the foreseeable future, as we said in our Investor Day. Capital deployment, mark?\nMark Keim: So on the capital side, I feel really good about our dry powder. We\u2019re starting off the year with a good cash balance at the parent. Our projected cash flow for the year is strong. And you can see the leverage metrics gives me a lot of room to raise more if I needed. On the M&A side, I\u2019m encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing for the year. Number of things in the hopper right now; of course, they all move at their own speed, we never make commitments about when they might happen but good line of sight on a number of targets, which I\u2019m hoping to deploy the capital against. What Joe and I have always been adamant about, though, is share repurchases, when and where appropriate. There\u2019s some small amount that is just not part of our normal hygiene that we would probably do during the course of the year. Not a big commitment by any means but just on an annual basis, there is some small amount we like to do. Part of that\u2019s, though, a function of what the M&A pipeline turns out on, we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out on the year.\nOperator: The next question is from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I know a lot has been covered here, so I just was going to ask one about the PBM carve-ins. And I guess could you talk about, is the impact that meaningful at all? I didn\u2019t hear you guys called out in the prepared commentary and didn\u2019t have anything on in my notes. So maybe just kind of maybe walk through the mechanics, how does it impact the income statement? Is there any meaningful impact of the financials from the PBM carve-ins?\nJoe Zubretsky: I think, you are, George, referring to the PBM carve outs, yes in California. \nGeorge Hill: Carve out for you guys, carve in to the state. \nJoe Zubretsky: Okay. Okay. Thank you. Just wanted to make sure we\u2019re talking about the same thing. Sure, we have a $500 million revenue decrement, in our forecast for the year due to the carve outs, which is a full year of California and a half a year of Ohio. And obviously, there\u2019s margin implication to that. These revenues that are taken out into a fee for service environment generally carry with them the average Medicaid margin. So think of it as the loss of the average Medicaid margins on $500 million of revenue.\nGeorge Hill: Helpful. Thank you. \nOperator: And the last question comes from Gary Taylor of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Most of my questions sort of touched on one way or the other, but just refining a little bit. Do you have any -- on the non-SEC exchange population, do you have any retention figures on that piece versus what it historically look like or it is too early?\nJoe Zubretsky: Gary, want to make sure we answer your question. When you say retention, you\u2019re talking about throughout the year our lapse rate or you\u2019re talking about how many members renew from the prior year?\nGary Taylor: The latter. \nMark Keim: Yeah, we do have pretty good insight at this point, a much better proportion of our starting membership this year is renewal, meaningfully better than say even last year. Part of that is with the smaller book, a number of our members rolled over with us. So we kept a much higher percentage of renewal members this year and that\u2019s a really good thing because we know those members better, we have the history on them and that converts right into risk adjustment, and starting the year with a much better risk adjustment position and obviously being able to code those members right out of the gate. So we feel good about that higher level of renewals, and it does translate into risk adjustments. \nGary Taylor: Right. And then my second one was on the Medicare risk adjustment headwinds related to the pandemic, I thought at one point, you cited that $1, it sounds like you\u2019re saying you\u2019re going to recoup $0.50 of that in 2022. Does it still mean there\u2019s another $0.50 for that and that\u2019s maybe kind of embedded in your remaining COVID recapture or has the dollar changed or am I just [Multiple Speakers]. \nMark Keim: No. It\u2019s Mark. Your memory is quite good. We, we used to talk about $1 of Medicare risk score in our embedded earnings. That is we just weren\u2019t able to get out there and do the in-home assessments and the risk scoring during the pandemic the way we had historically, so we were carrying $1. Now the good news is late in the third quarter, especially in the fourth quarter, we were actually able to realize part of that. CMS extended the window for submissions from 2020, which meant we were able to get a little bit more of that into the back half of \u201821. As a result, that dollar fell to $0.50 at the end of the year and will realize that $0.50 in our guidance. So the dollar we used to talk about $0.50 you got in third and fourth quarters, the other $0.50 you\u2019re getting in guidance at it. \nGary Taylor: Got it.

            "content": "Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. This morning I will discuss some additional details of our fourth quarter and full year performance. I will then turn to the balance sheet and some thoughts on our 2022 guidance. Beginning with our fourth quarter results by segment. In Medicaid, we reported an 88.3% MCR, a strong result that included continuation of costs from the net effect of COVID, offset by strong medical cost management. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 88.3%. During the quarter, the emergence of the Omicron variant had a greater impact on our Medicare population than on our other segments. Focused medical cost management and better than expected risk adjustment offset the net effect of COVID in the quarter.  In marketplace, reported MCR was 92.1%. While COVID infection rates in our marketplace population declined from the peak of the Delta variant in August, the net effect of COVID continued to pressure results in the fourth quarter. The Special Enrollment Period membership, which grew to almost 40% of our marketplace book in the quarter, also contributed to the elevated marketplace MCR.  Turning to full year results, our full year consolidated MCR was 88.3%. This result is modestly above our long-term target, as strong performance in our Medicaid and Medicare businesses was offset by the performance of our marketplace business. Specifically, our full year Medicaid MCR was 88.7%, in line with our 88% to 89% long-term target. Our full year Medicare MCR was 87.2%, in line with our 87% to 88% long-term target. In both Medicaid and Medicare, strong medical cost management, offset the net effect of COVID. Our full year marketplace MCR of 86.9% is well above our 78% to 80% long-term target, and includes approximately 430 basis points of the net effect of COVID as well as approximately 360 basis points from the impact of the Special Enrollment Period.  Turning now to our balance sheet, our capital foundation remains strong. We harvested $218 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, which brought our year end 2021 parent company cash balance the 348 million. Debt at the end of the quarter is 2.1 times trailing 12 months EBITDA. Our debt-to-total cap ratio is 47.8%. However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.8 times and 43.9% respectively. These metrics reflect the conservative leverage position, and ample cash capacity for additional growth and investment.  During the quarter, we redeemed our senior notes due 2022 using the proceeds of our November debt offering of notes due 2032. This refinancing will lower our total interest expense by 50 basis points, and extend our debt maturity towers to 2028 to 2032. More importantly, the transaction marks the final step in our capital restructuring strategy. We have eliminated the costly convertible bonds and addressed all near term maturities at coupon rates well below similarly rated issuers.  Turning to reserves, our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and we continue to be confident in our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter represented 51 days of medical costs expense, an increase of two days sequentially.  Now turning to guidance, beginning with membership. We ended 2021 with approximately 4.3 million Medicaid members. As discussed, our 2022 guidance reflects the resumption of redeterminations, which we expect will more than offset Medicaid growth drivers and result in 2022 year end membership of approximately 4.1 million members. In Medicare, we ended 2021 with 142,000 members. We expect year end 2022 total Medicare membership of approximately 150,000 members. This reflects strong AEP growth in our MAPD and D-SNP products and the addition of members from our Cigna Texas Medicaid acquisition.  In marketplace, we ended 2021 with 728,000 members. Based on open enrollment, we expect to begin 2022 with approximately 320,000 members, reflecting our strategy to achieve target margins in this business for 2022. Accounting for a limited SEP and normal levels of attrition through the year, we expect to end 2022 with approximately 250,000 members.  Turning now to premium revenue guidance. We expect premium revenue of approximately $28.5 billion or 6% growth. Excluding regulatory headwinds and our marketplace reset, this represents 14% growth over 2021. Specifically, our premium revenue guidance includes the following growth drivers; a full year of the acquired Affinity business, which closed October 25, and the Cigna Texas Medicaid business, which closed on January 1 for a combined $2.2 billion, approximately $1.1 billion of organic Medicaid and Medicare growth in our current footprint, and approximately $400 million for the Nevada Medicaid contract, which began on January 1. Partially offsetting these growth drivers are several headwinds to 2022 revenue growth; 1.2 billion of lower marketplace premium revenue, reflecting our strategy to restore target margins in this business, approximately 400 million related to the resumption of redeterminations, and 500 million from the carve out of pharmacy benefits in our California and Ohio Medicaid contracts.  Consistent with past practice, AgeWell is excluded from our 2022 guidance. We continue to expect this acquisition to close in the third quarter of this year, and will provide $200 million or more of additional premium revenue in 2022 when closed.  Turning now to earnings guidance. We introduced our initial full year 2022 adjusted earnings guidance of no less than $17 per share, reflecting 26% growth over 2021. Our EPS guidance reflects the realization of approximately $3.50 per share of 2021 embedded earnings consisting of approximately $1.50 per share of lower net effective COVID, roughly $0.50 per share for improvement in Medicare risk adjustment, approximately $1 per share, as we attain target margins in Magellan Complete Care and Passport and approximately $0.50 per share for the recently closed Affinity and Cigna Texas Medicaid acquisition.  Our 2022 guidance also includes approximately $0.80 per share of marketplace margin improvement not captured in the lower net effect of COVID. This is offset by the net impact of organic earnings growth and the resumption of redeterminations and the previously discussed pharmacy benefit carve outs. The restoration of marketplace margins to mid-single digits in 2022 will be accomplished through actions already taken. Specifically, we price to a higher medical cost trend, anticipating a more moderate COVID and SEP impact. We redesigned our product offerings, focusing on the silver tier in response to the increase member premium subsidies. Based on recently concluded open enrollment period, we expect to have a higher percentage of renewing members. We also expect a lower mix of special enrollment membership in 2022, based on the revised eligibility rules and our revised product design and distribution strategies. We expect many of these changes will also improve our risk adjustment results.  Moving on to select P&L guidance metrics. We expect our medical care ratio to be approximately 88%. The MCR improvement over 2021 is primarily due to lower net effect of COVID, our actions to improve marketplace performance in 2022, continued progress in medical cost management in our legacy and acquired businesses, and improvement in Medicare risk scores. We expect our adjusted G&A ratio to improve to 6.8%. This reflects discipline cost management, fixed costs leveraged from our revenue growth and mix, offset by continued investment in growth and capabilities. The effective tax rate is expected to be 25.4%. Adjusted after tax margin is expected to be 3.4%, consistent with our long-term targeted range. Weighted average share count is expected to remain flat at 58.4 million shares and we expect that just over 50% of our full year earnings will be produced in the first half of the year. As mentioned, our 2022 guidance includes the realization of $3.50 a share of 2021 embedded earnings, leaving approximately $2.50 a share of embedded earnings power in 2022, comprising the net effect of COVID of approximately $2 per share, which should continue to dissipate and approximately $1 per share, as we attain our target margins on closed deals, including Affinity, Cigna's Texas Medicaid business and our pending acquisition of AgeWell, partially offset by roughly $0.50 per share a projected Medicaid redetermination impact in 2023. As a reminder, this embedded earnings power does not represent 2023 guidance, but rather an accounting of drivers that are temporarily suppressing our earnings profile, and our current projection of the impact of Medicaid redeterminations post 2022.  This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. I think that's right, Joe. If you look back to 2020, we were about 318,000 members at the end of the year. 2021 probably would have looked a lot more like 2020, if it wasn't for the SEP that Joe talked about, which almost none of us in this space knew pretty much at this time last year. Backing out that SEP, 2021 would have looked a lot like 2020. Here we are in \u201822 with an outlook that's a lot like 2020 and 2021 before the SEP, so I think this level in our portfolio is about the right level, but as Joe mentioned, we will be entirely pricing for margin not for volume. Yeah, just to build on that. So that's a 1.3 billion decline over time but that's going to happen over a couple of years. So in my prepared remarks, I mentioned 400 million impacting our 2022 outlook, and the additional 900 million in \u201823. So our target was expectation that we would keep half of these members gain since the start of the pandemic. They'll come off over time per the public health emergency, and the revenue impacts across the two years are as I mentioned. Yeah, absolutely. So if you look at our membership, as you point out, we're down some 60% end of \u201821 versus \u201822 but as Joe mentioned, our revenues in marketplace are down 38%. Why the disconnect? Within our new membership is a very different mix of bronze versus silver. Last year, 2021, we had about 41% of our portfolio in bronze, that'll be down to 15% in 2022. As I'm sure you know the PMPM, the revenue PMPMs are quite different between bronze and silver, they're about 300 in bronze, and about 550 in silver on average across the portfolio. So that kind of offsets a lot of the volume decline, just on higher PMPMs on those members.  Now on the margins, Joe mentioned last year it's 86.9 MCR but we're tracking this year to a 79, which is smack in the middle of our long-term guidance for marketplace MLR. A couple of things that bridges from last year two this year, obviously, we took significant pricing, as we looked into the New Year. Your specific question around what did SEP and COVID cost us? I think we mentioned at a high level in our prepared remarks, we carried across marketplace 430 basis points of COVID last year and 360 basis points from the SEP. So you put those two together that's 8% of headwind that I'm not expecting in the New Year. COVID, we all have a more optimistic outlook for COVID in the New Year and SEP, the market will be behaved differently this year, the regulations are different, pure people can sign up and our distribution strategy puts us in a different place, I just don't think we'll have that exposure. So you get the 8% pricing coming into the New Year. You remove that headwind of COVID and SEP throw a trend assumption on there for what a normalized trend assumption could be and you have a very clear path to that high 70%, 79% MLR I'm talking about. And Justin, it is Mark. The only thing I'd add to that is I think you asked about redetermination as well. As you know we have the projections for some revenue coming off and some members through redetermination, what we don't have is those members picked up in our marketplace product at the margins we expect to drive here that is all upside to our projections. But we have a meaningful effort out there to pick up the redetermination members in our marketplace and Medicare in some case products through cross sell, which has meaningful upside to the numbers we've talked about today. So on the capital side, I feel really good about our dry powder. We're starting off the year with a good cash balance at the parent. Our projected cash flow for the year is strong. And you can see the leverage metrics gives me a lot of room to raise more if I needed. On the M&A side, I'm encouraged by what we're seeing for the year. Number of things in the hopper right now; of course, they all move at their own speed, we never make commitments about when they might happen but good line of sight on a number of targets, which I'm hoping to deploy the capital against. What Joe and I have always been adamant about, though, is share repurchases, when and where appropriate. There's some small amount that is just not part of our normal hygiene that we would probably do during the course of the year. Not a big commitment by any means but just on an annual basis, there is some small amount we like to do. Part of that's, though, a function of what the M&A pipeline turns out on, we'll have to see how that plays out on the year. Yeah, we do have pretty good insight at this point, a much better proportion of our starting membership this year is renewal, meaningfully better than say even last year. Part of that is with the smaller book, a number of our members rolled over with us. So we kept a much higher percentage of renewal members this year and that's a really good thing because we know those members better, we have the history on them and that converts right into risk adjustment, and starting the year with a much better risk adjustment position and obviously being able to code those members right out of the gate. So we feel good about that higher level of renewals, and it does translate into risk adjustments. No. It's Mark. Your memory is quite good. We, we used to talk about $1 of Medicare risk score in our embedded earnings. That is we just weren't able to get out there and do the in-home assessments and the risk scoring during the pandemic the way we had historically, so we were carrying $1. Now the good news is late in the third quarter, especially in the fourth quarter, we were actually able to realize part of that. CMS extended the window for submissions from 2020, which meant we were able to get a little bit more of that into the back half of \u201821. As a result, that dollar fell to $0.50 at the end of the year and will realize that $0.50 in our guidance. So the dollar we used to talk about $0.50 you got in third and fourth quarters, the other $0.50 you're getting in guidance at it."

            "name": "Joe Zubretsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe and good morning. Today, we will provide updates on several topics; our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021, our initial 2022 revenue and earnings guidance, and our growth initiatives and reaffirmation of our sustaining profitable growth strategy.  Let me start with the fourth quarter highlights. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of $2.88 with adjusted net income of $170 million and premium revenue of $7.2 billion, an increase of 48% over the prior year. The 88.8% consolidated medical care ratio demonstrates solid performance while managing through pandemic-related challenges. The net effect of COVID increased our consolidated medical care ratio by 150 basis points, decreasing net income per diluted share by approximately $1.50, which is $0.50 more than previously expected.  We managed to 7.4% adjusted G&A ratio, reflecting continued discipline and cost management while making the appropriate investments in our business to fuel growth. We produced an adjusted after tax margin of 2.3%. Excluding the net effect of COVID, our adjusted after tax margin was 3.5%, squarely in line with our long-term target.  We are very pleased with our fourth quarter performance with respect to both the delivery of solid earnings and the focused execution of our profitable growth strategy. The quarter marks the end of yet another very successful year, a year in which we continue to produce a high level of financial performance while navigating the effects of a global pandemic. We executed well and sustained solid operating margins, while driving significant revenue growth.  Now, turning to full year highlight, we reported full year 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $13.54, a 6% increase over initial full year guidance. We absorbed $3.50 of cost related to the net effect of COVID, which was $2 higher than initial guidance, implying $2.80 of improved underlying performance. Excluding the net effect of COVID, our after tax margin was 3.6%, consistent with our long-term target. We generated premium revenue of $26.9 billion, an increase of 47% over our full year 2020 premium revenue and $3.9 billion above our initial 2021 guidance. This strong premium revenue growth was well-balanced between organic growth and bolt on acquisition and is a testament to our successful transition to sustain profitable growth.  From a membership perspective, we ended the year with 5.2 million members, a 1.2 million member increase year-over-year. Notably, this 29% growth across all three segments was enhanced by the suspension of Medicaid redetermination and the special enrollment period in marketplace.  Turning now to our full year performance highlights by line of business. Medicaid, our flagship business, representing 76% of total company premium, produced strong premium revenue growth and stable earnings, as we continue to execute on the underlying fundamentals. For the full year, our Medicaid business achieved a medical care ratio of 88.7% consistent with our long-term MCR target, as moderate net effective COVID was offset by strong medical cost management.  For the year, our diversified portfolio state contracts performed well across all dimensions. Underlying medical costs trend was stable and well controlled, particularly within our growing population of high acuity members, while we continued to deliver high quality care. The right environment was stable and risk sharing corridors recaptured some of our outperformance but many already have been and will continue to be eliminated. For the year, our Medicare medical care ratio was 87.2%, a very strong result, squarely in line with our long-term target range and demonstrating our ability to clinically and financially manage the high acuity members in both our D-SNP and MMP program. This line of business plays an important role in the portfolio, as each year over 30,000 of our Medicaid members turn age 65.  Our marketplace medical care ratio for the full year was 86.9%, well above our long-term target. This reflects the significant cost related the net effect of COVID in our largest geographies, and the high cost impact of the adverse selection related the special enrollment period. Approximately 300,000 members were attracted to our product during this special enrollment period, accounting for 25% of full year marketplace member month. All told, our marketplace performance has been a disappointment. Later, Mark will summarize the steps we have taken in the environmental factors, which will allow us to restore margin to our mid-single digit target in 2022.  You will hear that included in our revenue guidance is a planned reduction in marketplace membership and a related 38% decrease in 2022 marketplace revenue. However, we expect this repositioning of our product to be significantly accretive to 2022 earnings and establish a strong foundation for this business going forward.  2021 was also a very successful year across multiple dimensions of our profitable growth strategy. Specifically, we successfully re-procured our Ohio Medicaid contract, and were awarded a new state contract in Nevada, validating our ability to retain existing state contracts, as well as win new business in new states.  Our M&A engine continued to execute at a high level. During the year, we announced two new acquisition, Cigna's Texas Medicaid business and AgeWell in New York, for combined premium revenue of approximately $1.7 billion. In October, we closed the New York-based Affinity acquisition, adding over 300,000 members and approximately $1.6 billion of annual premium revenue. And we successfully integrated three previously closed acquisitions representing approximately $5 billion in annual revenue, which continued to provide earnings accretion.  In summary, our full year 2021 enterprise results continue to demonstrate our ability to produce excellent margin, while growing premium revenue and successfully managing through the ongoing clinical and financial impacts of the pandemic.  Turning to our 2022 guidance, beginning with premium revenue; we are very pleased with the continued success of our profitable growth strategy. In 2022, we project premium revenue of approximately $28.5 billion, a 6% year-over-year increase on a reported basis and 14% growth before the effect of regulatory headwinds and the planned decline in marketplace revenue. This is consistent with the initial outlook provided on our third quarter 2021 earnings call. This growth is well-balanced between the new contract win, organic growth in our current footprint and the full annual run rate of our recent acquisition. Incremental to our revenue guidance will be the AgeWell acquisition when closed and any further extension of the public health emergency and the resulting suspension in Medicaid Redeterminations beyond April.  Moving to earnings guidance, our initial full year 2022 adjusted earnings guidance per share is no less than $17 or 26% growth year-over-year. We project a 3.4% adjusted after tax margin, consistent with our long-term target. Our 2022 earnings profile reflects durable and sustainable operating improvement and earnings growth. Included in our 2022 guidance is the realization of $3.50 per share of our 2021 embedded earnings power and additional organic earnings growth, partially offset by the effects of regulatory headwinds. With COVID still providing $2 of earnings per share pressure in 2022 and a few of our acquisition integration not yet fully matured, we still have embedded earnings power remaining to support future earnings growth.  In summary, our 2022 guidance features premium revenue growth of 14% before regulatory headwinds in the marketplace reset and strong earnings per share growth of 26% with key operating and margin metrics squarely in line with the long-term targets we shared at our September 2021 investor conference.  I will now provide a few concluding comments that frame our profitable growth strategy. We remain committed to staying close to the core. We intend to remain a pure play government managed care business, which has very attractive growth characteristics, demographically, and politically. We aspire to provide high quality care to our members, while driving to the lowest cost of delivery to produce attractive margin. We believe we have the right strategy and the right team to execute it. Our strong finish to 2021 and our 2022 guidance position us well and give us great confidence, we can achieve our long-term target of 13% to 15% premium revenue growth and 15% to 18% earnings per share growth on average over time.  As I conclude my remarks, I want to express my gratitude to our management team and our nearly 14,000 Molina colleagues. Their skill, dedication, and steadfast service continued to form the foundation for everything we have achieved, and everything we will achieve in the years to come.  With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials and 2022 guidance. Mark? Sure, Kevin. It is Joe. The strategic positioning of the business really hasn't changed. This is an adjunct to Medicaid. We serve the working poor, we leverage our Medicaid network, we leverage our Medicaid network pricing and our Medicaid footprint. So the strategy hasn't changed, 90% of our members are fully or partially subsidized. That is the market segment we are approaching. What you're observing this year is really a capital allocation decision. We never intended to have 728,000 members; that was a function of the Special Enrollment Period, which not only grew membership beyond what anybody expected, but added a significant element of adverse selection. Really what you're seeing this year is the repositioning of the product, as Mark suggested in his comments, from a pricing perspective, from a structural perspective, from a metallic tear perspective, and from a distribution perspective, to continue to target the working poor and to more emphasize the silver tier that is much easier to price to and to financially manage. So, this is a business where we're more focused on margin than we are on membership and we will let membership float up and down with our ability to obtain mid-single digit margin. Mark, anything to add? Our strategy is to focus on our Medicaid footprint and to capture individuals who at times income out of Medicaid and have a marketplace product to buy from us at zero premium. That's always been the strategy. And again, if you look back just a year ago, we're at 300,000 members and then of course the Special Enrollment Period, added 20,000 to 40,000 members a month while coming on to the to the marketplace roles at a higher acuity. So this is a capital allocation decision. It's a function of the SEP, it's a function of the pandemic, and we are comfortable with this business at roughly 7% to 8% of revenue, leveraging our Medicaid footprint, and we think our capital allocation is appropriate as we've now repositioned the risk profile of this business. Sure. With the public health emergency now having been extended to April, given the notification periods that are required, the first members will not be re-determining, reestablishing eligibility until July 1. We estimate that given that we grew organically, approximately 750,000 members, since the beginning of a pandemic, that equates to approximately $2.9 billion of revenue. We believe that $2.9 billion of revenue will decrease by 1.3 billion to a $1.6 billion residual target and that will happen partially over 2022 and then partially over 2023. Mark, you want to go through the numbers. Well, first on the membership and revenue question, what's interesting and should be noted, that although membership is down by over 60%, revenue is down by less than 40% because we shifted the book to the silver tier, the silver tier has a much richer product design and therefore revenue flow. So the PMPM revenue on silver is much higher. So the operating leverage is very positive. With respect to the margin, we are very confident on a return to mid-single digit. This produced -- this business -- due to the SEP and a pandemic, this business produced a low-single digit margin loss on $3 billion of revenue in 2021. We expect now to return that to a mid-single digit margin gain on $2 billion of revenue in 2022. So, sort of a seven to eight point increase in margins, a lot of it due to the elimination of the COVID pandemic, and much of it also due to the adverse selection that the SEP produced. Mark, the numbers? Sure, Stephen. You mentioned the embedded earnings power, which is not a theoretical construct, we didn't construct it in the abstract, it's real. And as we previously disclosed, sitting on top of our $13.50 actual results for 2021, about $6.50 was embedded earnings power. Clearly, with the significant impact of the pandemic, was something reasonable to account for. And because we've been so acquisitive, we thought it was also helpful to account for the growing accretion of our closed acquisition. So sitting on top of our $13.50 results in \u201821 was an additional $6.50 in embedded earnings. We have harvested $3.50 of that embedded earnings inside our $17 -- at least $17 plan for 2022. Also, as you suggested, sitting on top of the $17 is an additional $2.50 of continued embedded earnings power, due to the net effect of COVID, due to the Affinity and Cigna Texas acquisitions, which are new to the portfolio and AgeWell will add a little bit as well. So it's a real construct, the Embedded earnings have been harvested inside the 2022 plan, and some still exists to add to future earnings growth here over time.  And the net effect is COVID, we account for three things. We account for the direct cost of COVID-related care, we attempt to estimate the effect of utilization curtailment due to the pandemic, and then we account for the effects of the corridor. As we previously suggested, the corridors were significant in 2021. We had nine of them that were financially significant that has been reduced to three for 2022. So they linger on into \u201822 in the state of Washington, Ohio, and Mississippi. We have every confidence when the PAHD [phonetic] ends, they too will be eliminated. But that's really what's in the $2 net effective COVID for 2022 are the lingering effects of three corridor. Yes. Just, again, some additional color, the answer is yes, that special enrollment membership ran at a very high loss ratio. In fact, the volume, it represented about 40% of the member month volume in the fourth quarter alone and 25% for the year; ran at 105% MCR in the fourth quarter and just about 100% for the full year. So that was a significant contribution to our issues this year. As Mark suggested, blend it over the entire year, it was 260 basis points of MCR pressure, so we expect that to completely reverse into next year. The business is positioned where it should have been, pre-SEP. As I said, we follow our Medicaid footprint, we sell to highly subsidized members. Now that we've repositioned the mix to more silver than bronze, we have every confident that this is a solid baseline, mid-single digit margins, and probably mid to low single digit growth here over the foreseeable future. It certainly is part of our strategic planning process to look at all opportunities for allocation of capital. And yes, we're well aware of the capability builds that happen in other companies, we're well aware of vertical integration with providers. We believe, for the foreseeable future, there is so much growth, both in the demographics, actual membership growth, particularly in the high acuity segment, that we don't have to look far beyond our ability to take capitated risks, particularly with high acuity members, manage it really well, be a rate taker in Medicaid, grow Medicare, and use this ballast of marketplace, as this residual mechanism, that we don't need to do much beyond that, to sustain the growth around. We never would have suggested a 13% to 15% revenue growth and 15% to 18% EPS growth by 2025, if we didn't see enough runway to continue growing the business and in the swim lanes we're in. So certainly in our strategic planning process, we always look at capability build, we are not going to allocate capital to vertically integrate with providers. For us, we do not think that's a good deployment of capital. But there's so much runway with the number of lives that will go managed and particularly the high acuity lives that we don't need to do much beyond that. Well, certainly all the strategies that we were executing for 2022 were in place during the third quarter, they had to be, as we're going into open enrollment. Yes, membership is down but we withdrew in just about all of our markets the bronze product. Now, how many of those members were going to then take up a Molina-based silver product was a matter of estimation. Would I have hoped to end up with more membership if it was silver? Sure but 320,000 out of the gate is just fine. So as you take a complete product set off the shelf, except in three states where the circumstances are quite different, so basically pull it off the shelf, it was hard to know how much of that membership would have stayed in a Molina product with silver. But the good news is the members that we do have, most of them are renewal members, and 85% of them are silver. So irrespective of where we started and where we ended up, we're ending up in a really, really good place that portends well for the production of the mid-single digit margin. Sure. Well, certainly. When insurance is available to you, anytime you need it, you buy it, and it should be no surprise that the effects of the adverse selection were significant. So the question then becomes, what happens to that cohort, a lot of the uptake during the special enrollment period was bronze. So to the extent that that product was one that was affordable, and no Molina bronze product was available, they either renewed with us into silver or didn't renew us at all. The other fact that's really important is if the acuity of the member didn't change, they're still high acuity, but now we still have them. The fact that we've now had them for over a year means that we'll be able to capture risk scoring more appropriately and the fact that they're in silver means the risk score will count for more revenue. So the fact that some of these members renewed into the renewal book into 2022 is fine, the number is not very high, but now we have visibility into their acuity, we will be able to capture the risk score and at least earn a silver product.  Long term, my comments are going to really extend to our strategy, which is this is a high subsidy strategy to follow our Medicaid footprint. My view of this has always been and I'm looking -- I was always looking for the right word, it's a residual market for Medicaid. As members get part time jobs and have an income level just above Medicaid, they're probably eligible for highly subsidized marketplace product. Our strategy has always been to target that market. Now, our execution has been less than perfect on that but that's always been the strategy. So this is going to grow with the working poor, with the Medicaid population as people flex up and down. So we think there, as we said, an Investor Day low-single digit growth rate, mid to -- I think it's 5% to 8%, I think is the right number. And we're confident that that's the way the business will grow with a yield that's probably half of that and membership growth that's another half of that. But it's a product that should flex up and down with Medicaid as the Medicaid rolls move up and down. AJ, first, thanks for asking about Medicaid. It's obviously 80% of the revenue base and we couldn't be more pleased with the result that the Medicaid team produced in 2021 and the plan for \u201822. I mean, it's now a total of nearly $24 billion of revenue, $23 billion of premium revenue, and it's going to operate north of a 3% after tax margin. We continue to win new business. And yes, we do have to retain and defend our existing contracts, as you suggested. The California RFP was distributed just yesterday. We believe the Texas RFP will be distributed late in the first quarter and Mississippi is in the middle of a proposal writing effort, as we sit here today. Most of the other procurements are longer dated, but those are the three, we have a high confidence in all three of them. We run a really well run business in California, we have a great team. As you know, it's a pretty complex state with respect to how the region's work.  And yes, I think us and the rest of the managed care industry were disappointed that Kaiser was awarded a no bid contract but it's not as though it's some transformational event that's going to reshape the entire medical landscape, it's incremental. In fact, most of the impact will be in tooth plan regions where the local health plans have major share. So, high confidence in California, high confidence in Texas. In fact, we say that the fact that the regulatory process for the Cigna acquisition went so well, that it is testimony to the high regard the state holds us in with respect to the STAR+PLUS population.  With respect to new states, as you know, there's $108 billion pipeline over four to five years. We certainly won't chase every opportunity in every state. We are very selective as to where we think we can win evaluating a series of criteria. But our proposal writing team, our business development team, are extremely active, and to date have demonstrated a great deal of success with a Kentucky win and Nevada win and defending the Ohio contract. So the business is performing extremely well and at 80% of revenue, it needs to enhance and the outlook for growth, both organically and inorganically, is pretty robust. I don't think we've given a specific percentage but the rate increase was low-single digit across in Medicaid across the book. We are comfortable with its actuarial soundness. It has generally kept pace with our view of normalized medical costs trend, which also was low-single digit. So the rate environment is stable. It's rational, the principle of actuarial soundness and the return to a prospective setting of rates based on a sound medical baseline and the removal of these corridors seems to be happening as quickly as we originally estimated. Most of it is the shift from bronze to silver, which is a very significant differential in the PMPM revenues that those products generate. But we did go for it and attain a highest single digit rate increase in that business. In terms of where we start, and where we end, I think we said we started with 323 [phonetic] and 30,000 members, after the whole Annual Enrollment period. We are projecting pre-pandemic levels of attrition, which averaged 1.5% to 2% a month. Now, if that doesn't happen, we'll end up with more than 250,000 members by year end. We're also expecting not to pick up many members during Special Enrollment. As you know, the Special Enrollment Period still exists but the eligibility requirements have been significantly reduced to where only people at less than 150% of Federal Poverty Level income are eligible. So, if we \u2013 we won't pick up SEP members, we're confident in that and if attrition is at 1.5% to 2% a year, the 250,000 number by year end is about where we will end. Sure. Obviously, like the rest of the industry, we were pleased with the advanced notice, second year in a row that it looked very attractive on its surface. We've grown our Medicare business, even though half of it is demonstrations, which likely won't grow, the other half is his marketing business and the DSNP product that will grow. And in the fact we are growing from 142,000 to 152,000 members is significant. So we're really happy with the growth characteristics of the business. We think two years straight of rate increases, give us a lot of room to put the right benefits in the product to rate it appropriately, and to win new business and have margins in the mid-single digit after tax territory where we're positioned today. So we're really bullish on our Medicare business and we have a great team that will grow that business here over the foreseeable future, as we said in our Investor Day. Capital deployment, mark? I think, you are, George, referring to the PBM carve outs, yes in California. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Just wanted to make sure we're talking about the same thing. Sure, we have a $500 million revenue decrement, in our forecast for the year due to the carve outs, which is a full year of California and a half a year of Ohio. And obviously, there's margin implication to that. These revenues that are taken out into a fee for service environment generally carry with them the average Medicaid margin. So think of it as the loss of the average Medicaid margins on $500 million of revenue. Gary, want to make sure we answer your question. When you say retention, you're talking about throughout the year our lapse rate or you're talking about how many members renew from the prior year?"

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski. Please go ahead.\nJoe Krocheski: Good morning and welcome to Molina Healthcare's third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our third quarter earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who are listening to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that remarks made are as of today, Thursday, October 28, 2021 and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our third quarter 2021 press release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, statements regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the current environment, recent acquisitions, 2021 guidance, 2022 premium revenue outlook, our embedded earnings power, and our longer term outlook and expected EPS growth. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report for the 2020 year filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and our Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?\nJoe Zubretsky: Thank you, Joe and good morning. Today, we will provide you with updates on several topics: Our financial results for the third quarter of 2021; our 2021 guidance in the context of our third quarter results; our initial outlook for 2022 premium revenue and embedded earnings power; and lastly our growth initiatives and reaffirmation of our outlook for the future. Let me start with the third quarter highlights. Last night we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of $2.83 with adjusted net income of $164 million and premium revenue of $6.8 billion. The 88.9% consolidated medical care ratio demonstrates solid performance while managing through pandemic-related challenges. The net effect of COVID increased our consolidated medical care ratio by 110 basis points and decreased net income per diluted share by approximately $1. We managed to a 7.3% adjusted G&A ratio reflecting continued discipline in cost management while making the appropriate investments in our business to fuel growth. We produced an after-tax margin of 2.3% meeting our third quarter expectations. Our year-to-date performance metrics highlighted by an 88% MCR, a 7.1% adjusted G&A ratio and a 3.1% adjusted after-tax margin were all squarely in line with our nine-month expectations, despite the significant COVID-related impacts we experienced, totaling $2 per share year-to-date. And we accomplished all of this as year-to-date, we generated approximately 50% year-over-year premium revenue growth, successfully integrated businesses, representing approximately $5 billion in annual revenue and continue to execute on our growth initiatives. In summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. We executed well, delivered solid operating earnings and continued to drive our growth strategy. Let me provide some additional commentary, related to our third quarter performance. As we stated in the second quarter, year-over-year comparisons are less meaningful than they would be in a typical year, due to pandemic-related effects. Therefore, we will again focus our comments this morning on sequential comparisons. In the third quarter, we produced premium revenue of $6.8 billion a 3.3% increase over the second quarter of 2021, reflecting increased membership across our entire portfolio. We ended the quarter with approximately 4.8 million members, an increase of 142,000 members over the second quarter of 2021. We have now grown to serve approximately 800,000 additional members since the end of 2020 a 20% increase. Our Medicaid enrollment at the end of the quarter was approximately four million members, an increase of 53,000 over the second quarter of 2021. This increase was due primarily to the continuing suspension of Medicaid redeterminations, which has resulted in an increase of over 700,000 Medicaid members since the beginning of the pandemic. Our Medicare membership was 138,000 at the end of the quarter, an increase of 8,000 members driven primarily by organic growth as we follow our Medicaid footprint with an enhanced distribution strategy. Our Marketplace membership was 719,000 at the end of the quarter representing growth of 81,000 members over the second quarter of 2021, due to continued lower-than-expected attrition rates and membership additions during the special enrollment period which ended in mid-August. Turning now to our medical margin performance in the third quarter by line of business. Medicaid our flagship business, representing 77% of premium continues to drive premium revenue growth and stable earnings, as we execute on the underlying fundamentals. For the quarter, our Medicaid business achieved a medical care ratio of 89.6%, consistent with our expectations as the net effect of COVID was notable but manageable. Year-to-date our well-diversified portfolio of state contracts continues to perform well across all dimensions. Medical cost trend is stable and well controlled while we continue to deliver high-quality care particularly to high-acuity populations. The underlying rate environment is stable. Risk-sharing corridors continue to capture some of our outperformance, but many have been and continue to be eliminated. We are winning new state contracts and we are consistently finding attractive acquisition opportunities. Moving on to Medicare. Our Medicare results exceeded our expectations. For the quarter, our medical care ratio was 82.8%. Lower net effect of COVID including utilization curtailment and risk corridor true-ups combined with improved risk adjustment revenue served to drive a 490 basis point sequential improvement in the MCR. Our year-to-date Medicare MCR of 86.8% better reflects the underlying performance of this business and demonstrates our ability to clinically and financially manage the high-acuity lives in both our DSNP and MMP programs. Our Marketplace medical care ratio in the quarter was 91.3%. This reflects increased costs related to the net effect of COVID, the impact of the special enrollment period and the natural seasonality of the business. Recall that many of the new members we attracted were in regions disproportionately affected by COVID particularly in Texas. Moreover, we experienced higher non-COVID utilization by members enrolled to the special enrollment period, due to the relaxed eligibility guidelines. Our year-to-date Marketplace MCR was 84.8% and includes over 500 basis points of pressure from the net effect of COVID as well as 280 basis points of impact from the special enrollment period. We remain confident that we can achieve mid-single-digit pre-tax margins in 2022. We will accomplish this through actions already taken and changes to the environment that have already occurred. Specifically we priced to a higher medical cost trend. We redesigned our product offerings focusing on the silver tier in response to the increased premium subsidies and we note the conclusion of the 2021 special enrollment period and the more restrictive 2022 special enrollment eligibility rules. In summary, our third quarter and year-to-date enterprise results continued to demonstrate our ability to produce excellent margins while growing top-line revenue and successfully managing through the ongoing clinical and financial impacts of the pandemic. Turning to our 2021 guidance beginning with premium revenue. At our recent investor conference, we increased our 2021 premium revenue guidance to be more than $26 billion. With our third quarter results and the closing of Affinity, we are now projecting 2021 premium revenue of no less than $26.5 billion, which represents a 45% increase over the full year 2020. We are maintaining our full year 2021 earnings guidance of no less than $13.25 per share. This represents a $0.50 increase compared to the midpoint of our initial 2021 guidance despite absorbing an additional $1.50 per share from the net effect of COVID, revealing an improvement of $2 per share in underlying performance. Excluding the impact of the net effect of COVID, our 2021 guidance results in a 3.4% after-tax margin. This performance is consistent with our initial 2021 guidance and squarely in line with our long-term target margin expectations. We do, however, remain cautious in projecting our fourth quarter earnings due to a variety of exogenous factors, primarily related to the net effects of COVID across all of our businesses. Turning now to our 2022 revenue outlook. At our September investor conference, we provided the components of our initial 2022 premium revenue outlook that delivers premium revenue growth of more than $3 billion over 2021 guidance. Specifically $2.3 billion from already announced acquisitions including Affinity, which we just recently closed and the Cigna Texas Medicaid business, which we expect to close in January of 2022. Organic growth of $1 billion, representing approximately 4% growth across our current footprint. Approximately $400 million for our Nevada Medicaid launch, partially offset by a projected $500 million impact from redeterminations, which we expect to occur throughout 2022. Since then, we announced the AgeWell acquisition. Any incremental revenue from AgeWell in 2022 would likely be offset by pharmacy carve-outs in California and Ohio. A reminder, this 2022 outlook is prior to Marketplace membership changes and any additional strategic initiatives and acquisitions. Bear in mind that our Marketplace approach in 2022 emphasizes margin over membership growth. At this early stage, we expect 2022 Marketplace membership to be flat to down when compared to 2021. No matter where the Marketplace membership and revenue eventually lands, we expect the business to generate mid single digit pre-tax margins in 2022. Turning now to our longer term growth outlook. At our September investor conference, we laid out our strategy for sustaining profitable growth, a strategy that delivers 13% to 15% annual premium revenue growth off of our 2022 baseline. We expect approximately two-thirds of that growth to be organic, driven by a combination of underlying industry growth in a set of specific strategic initiatives that we described in detail. The remaining one-third will be derived from inorganic growth. The achievement, of which is supported by our current track record of M&A execution. Our profitable growth outlook as of sustaining our 4% to 5% pre-tax margins, harvesting the potential for operating leverage and accretively deploying excess capital to deliver a very attractive EPS growth rate of 15% to 18% on average overtime. The components of this growth engine are well established and working. Our year-to-date performance is testimony to the strength of that growth engine. Specifically, the Nevada Medicaid Contract Award speaks to our ability to win new state contracts to drive organic growth, and we continue to participate in additional RFPs we find attractive. And our M&A team continues to deliver. In addition to the Cigna Texas Medicaid business we announced earlier this year, this month we announced the acquisition of AgeWell managed long-term care business in New York for a purchase price of less than 20% of revenue. This acquisition complements our expanding New York footprint, serving high-acuity populations in the state. AgeWell serves approximately 13,000 members, with full year 2020 premium revenue of approximately $700 million. We expect AgeWell to deliver accretion of $0.15 to $0.20 per diluted share in the first full year of ownership. The M&A target pipeline is vibrant, and gives us confidence in continued execution. To recap our strategy, we remain committed to staying close to the core. We are a pure-play government managed care business. We believe the government managed care business has very attractive growth characteristics, demographically and politically. We aspire to provide high-quality care to our members, while driving to the lowest cost of delivery to produce attractive margins in this high-growth industry. We believe we have the right strategy and the right team to execute our sustaining profitable growth agenda. We remain extremely confident, that we can achieve our long-term targets of 13% to 15% premium revenue growth and 15% to 18% earnings per share growth. As I conclude my remarks, I want to express my gratitude to our management team and our nearly 13,000 Molina colleagues. Their skill, dedication, and steadfast service continue to form the foundation for everything we have achieved and everything we will achieve in the years to come. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Keim, for some additional color on the financials. Mark?\nMark Keim: Thanks, Joe, and good morning everyone. This morning I will discuss some additional details of our third quarter performance, and then turn to the balance sheet and some thoughts on our 2021 guidance. Beginning with our third quarter results. The net effect of COVID negatively impacted third quarter results by $77 million or approximately 110 basis points of our reported 88.9% MCR. During the quarter, we experienced higher COVID-related inpatient costs that began to taper off late in September. While the total company net effect of COVID at about $1 per share was very similar to the prior quarter, the components and impacts vary greatly within our segments. Total company MCR is up 50 basis points on several segment-specific items. In Medicaid, the net effect of COVID was a cost of $49 million or approximately 80 basis points of our reported 89.6% MCR. Sequentially, the 60 basis point increase in our Medicaid MCR over second quarter was driven largely by this higher net effect of COVID in the quarter. Our year-to-date MCR is 88.8%. We continue to expect the full year Medicaid MCR to be in the high 80s. In Medicare, the net effect of COVID had a favorable impact of approximately $16 million or 180 basis points of our reported 82.8% MCR. Sequentially, the 490 basis point improvement in our Medicare MCR was driven by two items. Approximately 390 basis point improvement in net effect of COVID, which includes curtailment and corridor related true-ups; and approximately 100 basis points related to improved risk adjustment revenue. Our year-to-date Medicare MCR is 86.8%. We continue to expect the full year Medicare MCR in the high 80s. In Marketplace the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $44 million or 570 basis points of our 91.3% MCR in the quarter. Sequentially, our Marketplace MCR increased approximately 640 basis points reflecting several items. Approximately 90 basis points of higher net effect of COVID, roughly 250 basis points from normal third quarter seasonality associated with members reaching their policy deductible limits, and approximately 300 basis points from higher non-COVID utilization by members enrolled through the special enrollment period and higher expected risk adjustment expense. Our year-to-date Marketplace MCR of 84.8% includes over 500 basis points of the net effect of COVID, as well as 280 basis points from the impact of the special enrollment period. Due to the higher-than-expected impact we now expect Marketplace pretax margins for the full year 2021 to moderate to roughly breakeven. We expect our 2022 marketplace pretax margin will be squarely in line with our mid-single-digit pretax margin target. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. We harvested $127 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter which brought our parent company cash balance to $703 million at the end of the quarter. We have ample capacity to fund the announced acquisitions and additional strategic initiatives. At our current margins, we generate significant excess cash and additional debt capacity. At our investor conference in September, we sized that recurring parent cash capacity at $1.4 billion annually. Importantly as we grow that cash capacity also grows. Turning to reserves. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and we remain confident in our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter represented 49 days of medical cost expense, an increase of one day sequentially. Prior period reserve development in the third quarter was modestly favorable, but any P&L impact was mostly absorbed by the COVID-related risk corridors. Debt at the end of the quarter is 2.3x trailing 12-month EBITDA. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 48%. However, on a net debt basis net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.6x and 40% respectively. These metrics reflect a conservative leverage position. A few additional comments related to our guidance. We increased our full year 2021 premium revenue guidance to no less than $26.5 billion reflecting the closing of Affinity and growth in all segments. Earnings per share guidance remains at no less than $13.25 per share which reflects the following: the net effect of COVID which we recently increased to approximately $3 per share for the full year, offset by our underlying outperformance and continued caution in forecasting utilization trends in the remaining months of the year due to the COVID pandemic. As previously conveyed, we continue to believe the incremental embedded earnings power of the company is in excess of $6 per share. This is composed of several items: the net effect of COVID of approximately $3 per share that should dissipate as the pandemic subsides; Medicare risk score disruption of approximately $1 per share; and as we obtain our target margins on the closed deals including Magellan Complete Care Passport and Affinity and the pending acquisitions of Cigna's Texas Medicaid business and AgeWell, we expect to achieve additional adjusted earnings per share well in excess of $2. As a reminder, this embedded earnings power does not represent 2022 guidance, but rather an accounting of the dynamic impacts that are temporarily suppressing our earnings profile. There are many other items that will affect our actual earnings guidance for 2022, including several possible scenarios for the impact of Marketplace membership, as well as the ongoing impact of the pandemic and ongoing strategic initiatives. In short, our 2021 earnings jumping off point into 2022 remains very strong. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMatt Borsch: Yes. I was just hoping we could revisit the topic of the redeterminations and how you see that playing out next year? I know you talked at the beginning of the call about 700,000 members that you estimate have an added as a result of redeterminations. So I'm curious, as said, how many of those you think will roll off if not perhaps potentially more and overall timeframe?\nJoe Zubretsky: Matt, we are forecasting that when the public health emergency ends and all the redetermination activity is fulfilled that we will end up with half the members we gained during the pandemic. And we say that, because the low-wage service economy has been rapid. The stimulus money is still out there. And time has shown that over past recessions, when Medicaid rolls have swelled, they stay increased when the crisis abates. So we're pretty confident that, membership in Medicaid post-pandemic will exceed Medicaid membership pre-pandemic. Now, over what period is a matter of judgment as you know the PHE is now planned to extend into mid-January, which means the first members with notice periods and membership notification periods the first members are eligible to roll off the books on April 1. So we have forecasted that we will be down $500 million in revenue in 2022, an additional $800 million in revenue in 2023. So the $2.9 billion of revenue gained will result in $1.6 billion of permanent revenue gain, $500 million in 2022, an additional $800 million in 2023, $2.9 billion moving to $1.6 billion.\nMatt Borsch: Fantastic. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Thanks. Good morning. My question is just on that embedded earnings power that you guys speak to. I'm trying to figure out the cadence of realizing sort of those embedded earnings and COVID feels a little bit like a step function potentially next year. So I'm just curious if there's big sort of step function impacts, or if this is more a series of many, many incremental benefits, and maybe just rough ballparks of sort of how we think about 2022, 2023, 2024?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, Josh. A few of them are a function of time as our acquisitions mature. And then, the wild card obviously is how much COVID will persist into 2022. And so I'll turn it to Mark to give you an accounting of how we see the $6 emerging overtime. Mark?\nMark Keim: Hey, Josh. It's Mark. Just a reminder on the $6, its $3 of COVID $1 of Medicare risk scores and as Joe mentioned $2 of the M&A. So let me add a little color to each one of them. On the Medicare risk scores we should see that $1 next year. Our team can get out there has gotten out there in a meaningful way to produce that $1 next year. So we feel good about that one. On the M&A there's $2. We think about that $2 in two categories. The deals that are already in our P&L probably have another $1 of upside to get to the target margins. That's Magellan Kentucky stuff like that. The other dollar is deals that we've announced or in the case of Affinity just closed but they're not in our P&L yet. About half of that dollar, we should get in the first year -- next year and the other half thereafter. So that's some expectation on the M&A. So then, you're back to the net effect of COVID. And that's the wildcard a bunch of drivers there. Sitting here at the end of October, I don't know that we're ready to give a view on how COVID progresses through 2022. But there's, a couple of things you can think about there. Part of the $3 is in our Marketplace business. And we've had some headwinds this year. We've clearly priced for those headwinds next year. So, we should see some reversal on that within the $3. The rest is going to be a function of what does the pandemic actually do? Do we have another variant? What is the non-COVID utilization and of course the corridors. Everything we know about the corridor so far is quite positive. We have several states -- four states that have terminated the corridors for next year and many that haven't given a formal view yet, but it looks very encouraging. So, a number of drivers around that $3 will we see some of it? I'm pretty sure. But I think it's just a little early to hazard a guess on how much.\nJosh Raskin: Perfectly fair. And just one quick follow-up on the risk adjusters. I know you said you're feeling good. I think in your prepared remarks Mark you actually mentioned that you're seeing some benefit already from risk adjuster improvement. And I was curious how does that happen intra-year?\nMark Keim: In Medicare?\nJosh Raskin: Yes.\nMark Keim: In particular a couple of things. So, CMS actually extended the window for risk adjustment submission this year which gave everyone the ability to get more work done and more adjustment in. So, that's certainly a good guy. The other thing in Illinois. Illinois expanded their MMP coverage to the full state. They were just a few regions before. So we went in and picked up a number of new members who are coming in really positive on a risk adjustment basis. So two nice drivers for us there.\nJosh Raskin: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: Hi thanks. I wanted to ask about the exchanges in your comments on refocusing on the silver plans. It does look to us like you might be pulling back somewhat on the bronze offering in some states. If that's right I would love to understand the thinking there and why you think pulling back versus repricing is the right approach? And just as you think about the comments around maybe flat to down enrollment for next year how much of your exchange book today is coming from products that you will offer next year? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure. Yes our repositioning of the product portfolio is really a function of the enhanced subsidies. We can move and our brokers can move members from bronze to silver at zero premium and high subsidies with no additional cost to the member and they get a plan with a higher actuarial value. So, it's better for the member. From our perspective, silver is more flexible and easier to manage. It's easier to develop risk scores and there's more pricing flexibility in silver. So, we're going to emphasize more silver next year than we did this year. Our bronze/silver mix is about 55-45 this year and will be more skewed to silver next year. So that's sort of our mix currently. Clearly, the special enrollment period was another headwind this year. And with the change in the rules that now people eligible -- people that will be eligible are only below 150% of federal poverty means that the membership flows some special enrollment in the industry should be a lot lower. In our case, we estimate about half of what they were this year. We added 200,000 members in special enrollment this year. And with the cutoff at 150% of FPL that's likely to be at least cut half. So, we're forecasting that our membership will be flat to down off the 719,000 this year which means revenue will probably be flat to down. But no matter where revenue lands, it's going to be earnings accretive in 2022. We are very confident in hitting our mid-single-digit pretax margin target next year even on a membership base that's likely to be lower than this year.\nStephen Baxter: Got it. And just as a follow-up to last one. I guess I assume that when you make comments about mid-single-digits that doesn't require the impact of COVID to go to zero. It doesn't require you to necessarily get back that entire 500 basis points. I'd love just to kind of hear about your thought process on how much of that you could continue to tolerate and still achieve the margins? Thank you.\nMark Keim: On that clearly we're carrying 500 of COVID this year. I'm not going to get into our specific pricing assumptions but we clearly anticipate more of that headwind next year as well as just a little bit of what Joe mentioned about on the SEP, but we're pricing in a manner to hit that mid-single-digit pretax.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Hall from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Hall: Hey, thank you guys. So, just a quick question on the 2022 embedded earnings. More of a clarification. It sounds like you mentioned greater than $6 EPS, which it feels like a little bit of an increase in prior activity, which may be coming from pending acquisition margins now well in excess of $2. Is that true? And are you guys seeing better margin performance on acquisitions?\nJoe Zubretsky: I think, I'll turn it over to Mark, but yes as we add the acquisitions they're going to be accretive. We're buying them very efficiently. Many of these properties are underperforming. Our integration teams are hitting if not exceeding our accretion targets. So as we add these acquisitions they're going to be accretive. We wouldn't do them if they aren't. But yes, the AgeWell acquisition now that affinity is in the fold has served to sort of increase our forward look on embedded earnings. We still say it's $6 plus. And again how much of that emerges next year and into 2023. We'll wait until we give specific guidance on 2022 in February.\nMichael Hall: Got it. And just one more question if I can. On exchanges it sounds like back in your Investor Day you picked up 50,000 lives in line in August. It looks like you gained another 30,000 on top. Could you talk about what you're kind of seeing with special on loan period now having ended? And then just typical exchange attrition with the premium tax credit and maybe some membership recapture from redeterminations do you anticipate at some point returning back to normal attrition level?\nJoe Zubretsky: Well, the special enrollment period ended in August. We believe that we'll see attrition between now and the end of the year. It will likely be lower than it was pre-pandemic, but we have 719,000 members now. We'll lose some and probably end the year maybe slightly below 700,000.\nMark Keim: And remember normal attrition for us is about 2% a month. As Joe mentioned this should be a little bit less than that going through the rest of the year, but I think that's a fair outlook.\nOperator: The next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. A couple of questions. First, can you talk a little bit about the difference in COVID spread for the exchanges versus Medicaid. Obviously you've given a lot on the exchanges, but we think these membership populations is somewhat fungible I guess outside of the duals. But is -- I'm curious why you think that the exchange population is such have to be COVID cause versus the Medicaid population really not being there? And then my second question is just on California Medicaid with the potential we're going to see an RFP here soon. I was hoping you can give us a little bit of an update. I know on your business there in terms of -- I know -- I think you have some business that's direct and then some that's partnered. And how you think this RFP is going to shake out in terms of what the state is looking for? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure. Justin on the marketplace and the COVID impacts there are really two factors. One is geography. Our marketplace business just happens to be in places that were hit hard particularly by the Delta variant Florida, Texas, California, Washington. So it follows the geography and follows our Marketplace footprint. The second, we believe is our marketplace population skews younger. Unvaccinated people that are being infected, but the cost of care on an episode basis is actually a bit lower. But the infection rate is high and the younger population that tends to be unvaccinated. So those are the two factors that we cite that seems to disproportionately affect our Marketplace business. On the California RFP, we believe we're very, very optimistic about our ability not only to hold on the business we have but to grow it. As you know we're very strong in L.A. We're very strong at Sacramento and San Diego. We have a nice business in the Inland Empire. We have a great reputation with the state. We perform well. We do all the hard work we need to do with respect to community involvement and charitable giving. We're in really good shape for the California RFP which supposedly at least the latest announcement will come in early 2022 for a contract date for 1/1/24. So we're in good shape in California. We're very optimistic about our prospects not only to maintain what we have but to grow.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So with the list of action items you're taking to get the Marketplace MLR and the pre-tax margins back on track for 2022 versus 2021, among those pricing probably is the biggest lever. But for the other ones you mentioned, such as, just redesigning the plan offerings and the more restrictive eligibility rules is there any color just on the range of how much those might move the needle on margins? Like could those move margins in the hundreds of basis points, or is it mainly really about the pricing to move your margins by let's call it 500 basis points or so in 2022 versus 2021 in the Marketplace business? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: A little bit of both. I mean, we priced to a medical cost trend in Marketplace that was somewhat reflective of the increased baseline that we experienced this year impacted by COVID. Second, so we priced to an increased medical cost trend. Second, the special enrollment members were experiencing a loss ratio in the mid-90s. And if that membership \u2013 some of that membership will renew, some of it will go away. And then of course, next year, the special enrollment period will be targeted at folks with 150% of federal property level incomes are down. So we believe that, the special enrollment period membership will be half or less than half of what it was this year. So all of those factors combined put us in really good shape and producing our mid-single-digit pre-tax margin target for next year, but as I said, likely on membership that is flat to down over 2021.\nMark Keim: And the only thing, I'd add there Steven is, with a big focus on margin rather than membership, we'll have a much higher component in our book of renewals. And the way risk adjustment works is we get much better scores on those renewals, once we've lived with the member for a year or two. So we derive better risk adjustment revenue, and certainly more confidence in the outlook of that revenue.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Two quick questions. One sort of talk around it on the Marketplace, but a lot of people came on board this year. You said and others have said it, during the extended SEP and it sounds like there may have been some adverse selection there. Do you think these people will re-up next year? Are you assuming the aggregate enrollment on the exchanges is actually down because some of these people won't renew proactively? And then my other question was I know you said, you're up 300 basis points sequentially in non-COVID utilization in marketplace. Can you comment on where you are in the non-COVID utilization relative to 2019 or pre-pandemic or baseline whatever you want to do? And Medicaid, Medicare and I guess even that basis in Marketplace, if you don't mind?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure. I'll try to parse through the various questions. On the first one, we did assume in our pricing that some of the SEP membership would renew, and therefore increased the cost trend that we included in pricing to accommodate that. Now, how many actually do renew and how many just joined because of an episodic health care condition and will leave, we'll have to wait and see. But we did price as though some of those renewal members \u2013 some of those SEP members would renew, and we think we've captured that in the medical cost trend we've included in our pricing.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Hi. Great. Thanks. I just wanted to go back to $3 COVID impact. I just \u2013 I've heard a lot of companies initially sized the COVID Impact number, and then slowly walk back kind of how we should expect it to come back or when we should expect it to come back or almost, if we should expect it to come back. And I just wanted to hear how you guys are thinking. It sounds like the Medicare risk assessment number is relatively clear, but I just want to make sure there's no issues about reinvesting some of that or something like that, so that the net number might be lower. And then, if we should expect you guys to continue to kind of that number for us as we head into next year, and give us an update on where we are versus that $3 number, or does that just get hard to do and you're not going to be breaking that out for us?\nJoe Zubretsky: It's \u2013 I'll answer the first part of that Kevin, and then I'll turn it to Mark. It's really difficult, because even though our COVID results quarter-to-quarter costing us $77 million and $1 per share seem like it was stable. The stories are quite different. In the second quarter the COVID direct cost of care were less than $100 million and it's twice that in the third quarter. And what ends up happening is when the COVID infection rates are really, really high and it's really intense, you get this counterbalancing impact of utilization curtailment. People fear of contagion of going in for services, hospitals and treating these COVID patients and can't accept discretionary and elective procedures and the like. So the third quarter, actually was one of our highest quarters, if not the highest quarter for the COVID, the direct cost of COVID-related care, but significantly offset with utilization curtailment. And then the corridors the risk-sharing quarters just kind of title through on a very stable basis. It's going to follow the infection rate, which makes it very hard to forecast. As we sit here today, we hope that Delta variant is over. We hope there are no additional variant, but we just don't know that yet. And so as we get closer to February, when we announce our fourth quarter results, we'll probably have a better handle. We will have a better handle on what we think COVID will do in 2022 and we'll announce it then. But the quarter-to-quarter results seem stable on a net basis, but the components are quite volatile, and it just follows the infection rate.\nMark Keim: And just to build on that Kevin, then what you have within what we call the net effect of COVID is the curtailment and the direct cost of COVID that Joe talked about. As a company, those two have worked in tandem so far, but you'll have to take a view on that next year on how this COVID evolved. And do we continue to see curtailment as the offset to that. We all need to take a view on that going into the new year. And then lastly on corridors, that is a component of our total net effect of COVID as well. As I mentioned earlier, we're optimistic that many states have already announced they won't have corridors in the new year, but how much of a continued drag will we have in some of the other states, remains to be seen but we're optimistic on that one. So that was $3 of the embedded earnings around the net effect of COVID. $1 you mentioned, on Medicare risk adjustment. As I mentioned, we continue to be very, very positive on the development of that $1. Remember, the pieces that we gave, aren't guidance. They're embedded earnings, which along with other headwinds or tailwinds can emerge. Medicare is looking pretty good. We'll see that dollar emerge, but don't forget we'll have things like sequestration next year and a few other factors that could add additional headwinds and tailwinds, but we feel good about that dollar.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Interested if you can give us some of your initial observations on how the 2022 Medicare AEP is progressing so far? And just interested in particular with a bunch of those new non-DSNP products that you rolled out for 2022, how those seem to be resonating in the market?\nJoe Zubretsky: We think we're in good shape for growth next year. We're not giving a growth expectation on Medicare at this stage. But you're absolutely right, we launched some traditional Medicare Advantage products in some of our DSNP footprint to capture folks who had incomes that didn't allow them to be eligible for DSNP but were low income, using the same network, the same facilities and access to the same type of brokers who operate in those various areas. So, we're really optimistic about our growth prospects as we launched our MAPD products to low-income individuals and our expanded DSNP footprint and additional penetration in our existing footprint. We still do not have the market share that we think we can ultimately obtain in our DSNP footprint. So we're really bullish on the prospects during AEP this year, bearing in mind that we do get to enroll certain people throughout the year as well.\nScott Fidel: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, just interested if we can go back to the Marketplace, and just how you're thinking about the overall market environment for 2022, now that we have all the landscape data out, et cetera. I mean we can certainly see that your pricing is firm certainly relative to the market, as you've been talking about looking to regain margin. Clearly, from the market overall, a lot more issuers right in the market. Benchmark premiums are lower again next year. So, just interested in how you're thinking about the competitive environment and sort of the level of rationality for the marketplace next year? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, Scott. Our strategy is somewhat different than many of our competitors' strategies. What we're targeting are the working poor. We leverage our Medicaid network. We leverage our Medicaid network pricing, and our target market is fully or highly subsidized members. We are not targeting the mass affluent. That's number one. Number two, we did price this year to make sure that we hit our target margins of mid single-digit pre-tax. The way we look at this business is the revenue is going to float up and down with a fixed target margin at mid single digits. We will price for mid single-digit margins, and we'll let the revenue float up and down. The marketplace is a residual market. It flexes up and down with Medicaid eligibility. It's 15 million members nationally strong. We're in great shape in the markets that we choose to play in and our target market is somewhat different than the target markets for many of these new competitors. So, wherever revenue and membership plans for next year, it will be earnings accretive in 2022.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Windley: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Joe, I wanted to just kind of marry a couple of 4% together. Your -- in your Investor Day, you talked about in your long-term growth expectations for Medicaid kind of 4% growth on the like-for-like base presuming -- I don't think you talked in detail, but presuming some of that enrollment some of that's a little bit of rate. When we look at your assumptions around retention of the redetermination, you're kind of assuming the 375 on your base at the beginning of the pandemic. Also works out to be about 4% per year growth if the pandemic weren't to have happened. I guess, I'm wondering if the elevated retention of these pandemic lives, the redetermination lives is not a little bit of a pull forward on the future or a double dip. And just wondering if you could elaborate on your thoughts around the ability to continue to grow the base 4% even if you retain this higher level of redetermined lives.\nMark Keim: Hey, it's Mark. I'll take that one. So, you're right. On Medicaid, we talked about the base growing at 4%, which is as you mentioned probably half and half between rate and membership growth. That's the market continuing to grow. Now what we stacked on top of that was the headwinds of redetermination. Joe talked through earlier how that was $0.5 billion in 2022 and another 800 million in 2023. So your question gets back to, does that dampen the 2% membership growth? I think it's where you're going. And we don't think it does, because at the end of the day the pool of Medicaid eligible population continues to grow. So yes, you have redetermination, which is addressing people over the last two years, which maybe have lost eligibility. But if the overall pool is growing and we believe it is, we showed a chart at Investor Day that shows every time the country goes through a crisis of one kind or another, these Medicaid roles increase, but they don't go back to where they were. They're sticky at maybe half the growth quite frequently. So we think that overall pool is growing. So we'll have a little bit of a headwind of people from the past losing eligibility, but the pool of new folks coming in and newly eligible continues to grow. So, we feel pretty confident in that outlook.\nJoe Zubretsky: David I always say that whether redetermination is a headwind or a tailwind depends on where you're measuring it from. We like to think of it as a value creator, because we measure it from pre-pandemic. The Medicaid roles will be higher post pandemic that may work pre even though year-over-year there might be some choppiness.\nDavid Windley: Got it. Thanks. And just one more question on non-COVID utilization. Are you seeing signs of changing acuity as non-COVID utilization comes back? It's not a topic that's gotten discussed very much.\nJoe Zubretsky: No. We -- in many of our markets and in many of our products, it appears to be business as usual, particularly as the Delta variant started to dissipate in late September into October. In August, the Delta variant was really intense and August utilization was very high and we saw some curtailment there. But again, it flexes up and down -- almost routinely flexes up and down with the intensity of COVID infection rate. So in many of our states and many of our products, the curtailment is no longer, but it flexes up and down with the COVID infection rate.\nDavid Windley: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gary Taylor from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. As you were talking about 2022, you laid out some nice potential tailwinds. Wondering if there's anything notable on the headwind side to talk about now? I know you suggested COVID's obviously an unknown. You talked about a couple pharmacy carve-outs that I wouldn't imagine are material to earnings. Otherwise, you would have mentioned it, but any notable potential headwinds we should be thinking about as we're updating models?\nJoe Zubretsky: No, I think -- yeah, I would say we've made some judgments around redetermination. Certainly, how much COVID persists into next year that you've identified and then there's just the puts and takes of managed care. Are you capturing -- are you managing medical cost to your trend. But I can't think of an event-driven -- a headwind that is kind of event driven or situationally driven. Just managing managed care, but we have a proven ability to always manage our medical costs to the trend that is embedded in our products and the pricing of our products. So we're pretty comfortable that 2022 could shape up to be a very attractive year for us.\nGary Taylor: Thanks. And then my other question would just be how do we think about the roll-off of the COVID risk corridors impacting seasonality of margins and earnings in 2022? Should we think the earnings become a little more back-end loaded than perhaps they had been pre-COVID?\nJoe Zubretsky: Well, four states have eliminated them. Many of the states that are on January one rating cycles have not yet declared whether they will continue them or not. The only one that actually is formally continued into next year is in Mississippi. So it's hard to say. As they're announced either to be eliminated or to persist and whether they persist for a full-year or half year is just largely unknown at this time. So I think your point, is a correct one. It -- whatever happens we'll likely expect our quarter-to-quarter results next year. Whether it's back-ended or front-end loaded, I don't know yet, but the only corridor that actually has been announced that persists into 2022 because their state fiscal year straddles the calendar year is Mississippi.\nGary Taylor: Okay. Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Mike Newshel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMike Newshel: Thanks. So you talked about the adverse selection especially in rolling period this year. Are you worried at all that you might see some similar adverse selection maybe to a lesser degree from the monthly special moment periods for low incomes? And I guess, in the same vein for the Medicaid lives subject to redetermination that you mentioned, would you expect differences in the acuity and margin profile of the half you expect to keep versus the half it goes? \nJoe Zubretsky: No. On the Medicaid, I'll answer the Medicaid question, first. On the Medicaid side we're pretty comfortable that wherever membership goes, how much reduced membership there is because of redetermination, the margins that we're experiencing on the population should be thought of as our portfolio averages. There's actually very little evidence that the acuity of the population shifted all that much. And if it did, some of the states enacted retroactive acuity adjustments that are already embedded in our earnings and then of course, there's the corridors where any favorable experience is given back through the corridor and not through your rates. So we're pretty comfortable saying when you think about membership increases and decreases in Medicaid, due to redetermination we think of it in terms of portfolio averages. On the Marketplace side, we really increased the trend we embedded in the pricing of our product, which I think is demonstrated through some of the filings, you've seen where we really tried to capture not only the higher baseline due to COVID but the higher acuity on what we are experiencing very early in the special enrollment process. And that coupled with the fact that we should have fewer members coming into our membership roles in special enrollment next year. Again gives us great confidence that that mid-single-digit pre-tax margin is attainable. Operator?\nOperator: There are no more questions in the queue. This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Keim",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and good morning everyone. This morning I will discuss some additional details of our third quarter performance, and then turn to the balance sheet and some thoughts on our 2021 guidance. Beginning with our third quarter results. The net effect of COVID negatively impacted third quarter results by $77 million or approximately 110 basis points of our reported 88.9% MCR. During the quarter, we experienced higher COVID-related inpatient costs that began to taper off late in September. While the total company net effect of COVID at about $1 per share was very similar to the prior quarter, the components and impacts vary greatly within our segments. Total company MCR is up 50 basis points on several segment-specific items. In Medicaid, the net effect of COVID was a cost of $49 million or approximately 80 basis points of our reported 89.6% MCR. Sequentially, the 60 basis point increase in our Medicaid MCR over second quarter was driven largely by this higher net effect of COVID in the quarter. Our year-to-date MCR is 88.8%. We continue to expect the full year Medicaid MCR to be in the high 80s. In Medicare, the net effect of COVID had a favorable impact of approximately $16 million or 180 basis points of our reported 82.8% MCR. Sequentially, the 490 basis point improvement in our Medicare MCR was driven by two items. Approximately 390 basis point improvement in net effect of COVID, which includes curtailment and corridor related true-ups; and approximately 100 basis points related to improved risk adjustment revenue. Our year-to-date Medicare MCR is 86.8%. We continue to expect the full year Medicare MCR in the high 80s. In Marketplace the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $44 million or 570 basis points of our 91.3% MCR in the quarter. Sequentially, our Marketplace MCR increased approximately 640 basis points reflecting several items. Approximately 90 basis points of higher net effect of COVID, roughly 250 basis points from normal third quarter seasonality associated with members reaching their policy deductible limits, and approximately 300 basis points from higher non-COVID utilization by members enrolled through the special enrollment period and higher expected risk adjustment expense. Our year-to-date Marketplace MCR of 84.8% includes over 500 basis points of the net effect of COVID, as well as 280 basis points from the impact of the special enrollment period. Due to the higher-than-expected impact we now expect Marketplace pretax margins for the full year 2021 to moderate to roughly breakeven. We expect our 2022 marketplace pretax margin will be squarely in line with our mid-single-digit pretax margin target. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. We harvested $127 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter which brought our parent company cash balance to $703 million at the end of the quarter. We have ample capacity to fund the announced acquisitions and additional strategic initiatives. At our current margins, we generate significant excess cash and additional debt capacity. At our investor conference in September, we sized that recurring parent cash capacity at $1.4 billion annually. Importantly as we grow that cash capacity also grows. Turning to reserves. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and we remain confident in our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter represented 49 days of medical cost expense, an increase of one day sequentially. Prior period reserve development in the third quarter was modestly favorable, but any P&L impact was mostly absorbed by the COVID-related risk corridors. Debt at the end of the quarter is 2.3x trailing 12-month EBITDA. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 48%. However, on a net debt basis net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.6x and 40% respectively. These metrics reflect a conservative leverage position. A few additional comments related to our guidance. We increased our full year 2021 premium revenue guidance to no less than $26.5 billion reflecting the closing of Affinity and growth in all segments. Earnings per share guidance remains at no less than $13.25 per share which reflects the following: the net effect of COVID which we recently increased to approximately $3 per share for the full year, offset by our underlying outperformance and continued caution in forecasting utilization trends in the remaining months of the year due to the COVID pandemic. As previously conveyed, we continue to believe the incremental embedded earnings power of the company is in excess of $6 per share. This is composed of several items: the net effect of COVID of approximately $3 per share that should dissipate as the pandemic subsides; Medicare risk score disruption of approximately $1 per share; and as we obtain our target margins on the closed deals including Magellan Complete Care Passport and Affinity and the pending acquisitions of Cigna's Texas Medicaid business and AgeWell, we expect to achieve additional adjusted earnings per share well in excess of $2. As a reminder, this embedded earnings power does not represent 2022 guidance, but rather an accounting of the dynamic impacts that are temporarily suppressing our earnings profile. There are many other items that will affect our actual earnings guidance for 2022, including several possible scenarios for the impact of Marketplace membership, as well as the ongoing impact of the pandemic and ongoing strategic initiatives. In short, our 2021 earnings jumping off point into 2022 remains very strong. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator we are now ready to take questions. Hey, Josh. It's Mark. Just a reminder on the $6, its $3 of COVID $1 of Medicare risk scores and as Joe mentioned $2 of the M&A. So let me add a little color to each one of them. On the Medicare risk scores we should see that $1 next year. Our team can get out there has gotten out there in a meaningful way to produce that $1 next year. So we feel good about that one. On the M&A there's $2. We think about that $2 in two categories. The deals that are already in our P&L probably have another $1 of upside to get to the target margins. That's Magellan Kentucky stuff like that. The other dollar is deals that we've announced or in the case of Affinity just closed but they're not in our P&L yet. About half of that dollar, we should get in the first year -- next year and the other half thereafter. So that's some expectation on the M&A. So then, you're back to the net effect of COVID. And that's the wildcard a bunch of drivers there. Sitting here at the end of October, I don't know that we're ready to give a view on how COVID progresses through 2022. But there's, a couple of things you can think about there. Part of the $3 is in our Marketplace business. And we've had some headwinds this year. We've clearly priced for those headwinds next year. So, we should see some reversal on that within the $3. The rest is going to be a function of what does the pandemic actually do? Do we have another variant? What is the non-COVID utilization and of course the corridors. Everything we know about the corridor so far is quite positive. We have several states -- four states that have terminated the corridors for next year and many that haven't given a formal view yet, but it looks very encouraging. So, a number of drivers around that $3 will we see some of it? I'm pretty sure. But I think it's just a little early to hazard a guess on how much. In Medicare? In particular a couple of things. So, CMS actually extended the window for risk adjustment submission this year which gave everyone the ability to get more work done and more adjustment in. So, that's certainly a good guy. The other thing in Illinois. Illinois expanded their MMP coverage to the full state. They were just a few regions before. So we went in and picked up a number of new members who are coming in really positive on a risk adjustment basis. So two nice drivers for us there. On that clearly we're carrying 500 of COVID this year. I'm not going to get into our specific pricing assumptions but we clearly anticipate more of that headwind next year as well as just a little bit of what Joe mentioned about on the SEP, but we're pricing in a manner to hit that mid-single-digit pretax. And remember normal attrition for us is about 2% a month. As Joe mentioned this should be a little bit less than that going through the rest of the year, but I think that's a fair outlook. And the only thing, I'd add there Steven is, with a big focus on margin rather than membership, we'll have a much higher component in our book of renewals. And the way risk adjustment works is we get much better scores on those renewals, once we've lived with the member for a year or two. So we derive better risk adjustment revenue, and certainly more confidence in the outlook of that revenue. And just to build on that Kevin, then what you have within what we call the net effect of COVID is the curtailment and the direct cost of COVID that Joe talked about. As a company, those two have worked in tandem so far, but you'll have to take a view on that next year on how this COVID evolved. And do we continue to see curtailment as the offset to that. We all need to take a view on that going into the new year. And then lastly on corridors, that is a component of our total net effect of COVID as well. As I mentioned earlier, we're optimistic that many states have already announced they won't have corridors in the new year, but how much of a continued drag will we have in some of the other states, remains to be seen but we're optimistic on that one. So that was $3 of the embedded earnings around the net effect of COVID. $1 you mentioned, on Medicare risk adjustment. As I mentioned, we continue to be very, very positive on the development of that $1. Remember, the pieces that we gave, aren't guidance. They're embedded earnings, which along with other headwinds or tailwinds can emerge. Medicare is looking pretty good. We'll see that dollar emerge, but don't forget we'll have things like sequestration next year and a few other factors that could add additional headwinds and tailwinds, but we feel good about that dollar. Hey, it's Mark. I'll take that one. So, you're right. On Medicaid, we talked about the base growing at 4%, which is as you mentioned probably half and half between rate and membership growth. That's the market continuing to grow. Now what we stacked on top of that was the headwinds of redetermination. Joe talked through earlier how that was $0.5 billion in 2022 and another 800 million in 2023. So your question gets back to, does that dampen the 2% membership growth? I think it's where you're going. And we don't think it does, because at the end of the day the pool of Medicaid eligible population continues to grow. So yes, you have redetermination, which is addressing people over the last two years, which maybe have lost eligibility. But if the overall pool is growing and we believe it is, we showed a chart at Investor Day that shows every time the country goes through a crisis of one kind or another, these Medicaid roles increase, but they don't go back to where they were. They're sticky at maybe half the growth quite frequently. So we think that overall pool is growing. So we'll have a little bit of a headwind of people from the past losing eligibility, but the pool of new folks coming in and newly eligible continues to grow. So, we feel pretty confident in that outlook."

            "content": "Thank you, Joe and good morning. Today, we will provide you with updates on several topics: Our financial results for the third quarter of 2021; our 2021 guidance in the context of our third quarter results; our initial outlook for 2022 premium revenue and embedded earnings power; and lastly our growth initiatives and reaffirmation of our outlook for the future. Let me start with the third quarter highlights. Last night we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of $2.83 with adjusted net income of $164 million and premium revenue of $6.8 billion. The 88.9% consolidated medical care ratio demonstrates solid performance while managing through pandemic-related challenges. The net effect of COVID increased our consolidated medical care ratio by 110 basis points and decreased net income per diluted share by approximately $1. We managed to a 7.3% adjusted G&A ratio reflecting continued discipline in cost management while making the appropriate investments in our business to fuel growth. We produced an after-tax margin of 2.3% meeting our third quarter expectations. Our year-to-date performance metrics highlighted by an 88% MCR, a 7.1% adjusted G&A ratio and a 3.1% adjusted after-tax margin were all squarely in line with our nine-month expectations, despite the significant COVID-related impacts we experienced, totaling $2 per share year-to-date. And we accomplished all of this as year-to-date, we generated approximately 50% year-over-year premium revenue growth, successfully integrated businesses, representing approximately $5 billion in annual revenue and continue to execute on our growth initiatives. In summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. We executed well, delivered solid operating earnings and continued to drive our growth strategy. Let me provide some additional commentary, related to our third quarter performance. As we stated in the second quarter, year-over-year comparisons are less meaningful than they would be in a typical year, due to pandemic-related effects. Therefore, we will again focus our comments this morning on sequential comparisons. In the third quarter, we produced premium revenue of $6.8 billion a 3.3% increase over the second quarter of 2021, reflecting increased membership across our entire portfolio. We ended the quarter with approximately 4.8 million members, an increase of 142,000 members over the second quarter of 2021. We have now grown to serve approximately 800,000 additional members since the end of 2020 a 20% increase. Our Medicaid enrollment at the end of the quarter was approximately four million members, an increase of 53,000 over the second quarter of 2021. This increase was due primarily to the continuing suspension of Medicaid redeterminations, which has resulted in an increase of over 700,000 Medicaid members since the beginning of the pandemic. Our Medicare membership was 138,000 at the end of the quarter, an increase of 8,000 members driven primarily by organic growth as we follow our Medicaid footprint with an enhanced distribution strategy. Our Marketplace membership was 719,000 at the end of the quarter representing growth of 81,000 members over the second quarter of 2021, due to continued lower-than-expected attrition rates and membership additions during the special enrollment period which ended in mid-August. Turning now to our medical margin performance in the third quarter by line of business. Medicaid our flagship business, representing 77% of premium continues to drive premium revenue growth and stable earnings, as we execute on the underlying fundamentals. For the quarter, our Medicaid business achieved a medical care ratio of 89.6%, consistent with our expectations as the net effect of COVID was notable but manageable. Year-to-date our well-diversified portfolio of state contracts continues to perform well across all dimensions. Medical cost trend is stable and well controlled while we continue to deliver high-quality care particularly to high-acuity populations. The underlying rate environment is stable. Risk-sharing corridors continue to capture some of our outperformance, but many have been and continue to be eliminated. We are winning new state contracts and we are consistently finding attractive acquisition opportunities. Moving on to Medicare. Our Medicare results exceeded our expectations. For the quarter, our medical care ratio was 82.8%. Lower net effect of COVID including utilization curtailment and risk corridor true-ups combined with improved risk adjustment revenue served to drive a 490 basis point sequential improvement in the MCR. Our year-to-date Medicare MCR of 86.8% better reflects the underlying performance of this business and demonstrates our ability to clinically and financially manage the high-acuity lives in both our DSNP and MMP programs. Our Marketplace medical care ratio in the quarter was 91.3%. This reflects increased costs related to the net effect of COVID, the impact of the special enrollment period and the natural seasonality of the business. Recall that many of the new members we attracted were in regions disproportionately affected by COVID particularly in Texas. Moreover, we experienced higher non-COVID utilization by members enrolled to the special enrollment period, due to the relaxed eligibility guidelines. Our year-to-date Marketplace MCR was 84.8% and includes over 500 basis points of pressure from the net effect of COVID as well as 280 basis points of impact from the special enrollment period. We remain confident that we can achieve mid-single-digit pre-tax margins in 2022. We will accomplish this through actions already taken and changes to the environment that have already occurred. Specifically we priced to a higher medical cost trend. We redesigned our product offerings focusing on the silver tier in response to the increased premium subsidies and we note the conclusion of the 2021 special enrollment period and the more restrictive 2022 special enrollment eligibility rules. In summary, our third quarter and year-to-date enterprise results continued to demonstrate our ability to produce excellent margins while growing top-line revenue and successfully managing through the ongoing clinical and financial impacts of the pandemic. Turning to our 2021 guidance beginning with premium revenue. At our recent investor conference, we increased our 2021 premium revenue guidance to be more than $26 billion. With our third quarter results and the closing of Affinity, we are now projecting 2021 premium revenue of no less than $26.5 billion, which represents a 45% increase over the full year 2020. We are maintaining our full year 2021 earnings guidance of no less than $13.25 per share. This represents a $0.50 increase compared to the midpoint of our initial 2021 guidance despite absorbing an additional $1.50 per share from the net effect of COVID, revealing an improvement of $2 per share in underlying performance. Excluding the impact of the net effect of COVID, our 2021 guidance results in a 3.4% after-tax margin. This performance is consistent with our initial 2021 guidance and squarely in line with our long-term target margin expectations. We do, however, remain cautious in projecting our fourth quarter earnings due to a variety of exogenous factors, primarily related to the net effects of COVID across all of our businesses. Turning now to our 2022 revenue outlook. At our September investor conference, we provided the components of our initial 2022 premium revenue outlook that delivers premium revenue growth of more than $3 billion over 2021 guidance. Specifically $2.3 billion from already announced acquisitions including Affinity, which we just recently closed and the Cigna Texas Medicaid business, which we expect to close in January of 2022. Organic growth of $1 billion, representing approximately 4% growth across our current footprint. Approximately $400 million for our Nevada Medicaid launch, partially offset by a projected $500 million impact from redeterminations, which we expect to occur throughout 2022. Since then, we announced the AgeWell acquisition. Any incremental revenue from AgeWell in 2022 would likely be offset by pharmacy carve-outs in California and Ohio. A reminder, this 2022 outlook is prior to Marketplace membership changes and any additional strategic initiatives and acquisitions. Bear in mind that our Marketplace approach in 2022 emphasizes margin over membership growth. At this early stage, we expect 2022 Marketplace membership to be flat to down when compared to 2021. No matter where the Marketplace membership and revenue eventually lands, we expect the business to generate mid single digit pre-tax margins in 2022. Turning now to our longer term growth outlook. At our September investor conference, we laid out our strategy for sustaining profitable growth, a strategy that delivers 13% to 15% annual premium revenue growth off of our 2022 baseline. We expect approximately two-thirds of that growth to be organic, driven by a combination of underlying industry growth in a set of specific strategic initiatives that we described in detail. The remaining one-third will be derived from inorganic growth. The achievement, of which is supported by our current track record of M&A execution. Our profitable growth outlook as of sustaining our 4% to 5% pre-tax margins, harvesting the potential for operating leverage and accretively deploying excess capital to deliver a very attractive EPS growth rate of 15% to 18% on average overtime. The components of this growth engine are well established and working. Our year-to-date performance is testimony to the strength of that growth engine. Specifically, the Nevada Medicaid Contract Award speaks to our ability to win new state contracts to drive organic growth, and we continue to participate in additional RFPs we find attractive. And our M&A team continues to deliver. In addition to the Cigna Texas Medicaid business we announced earlier this year, this month we announced the acquisition of AgeWell managed long-term care business in New York for a purchase price of less than 20% of revenue. This acquisition complements our expanding New York footprint, serving high-acuity populations in the state. AgeWell serves approximately 13,000 members, with full year 2020 premium revenue of approximately $700 million. We expect AgeWell to deliver accretion of $0.15 to $0.20 per diluted share in the first full year of ownership. The M&A target pipeline is vibrant, and gives us confidence in continued execution. To recap our strategy, we remain committed to staying close to the core. We are a pure-play government managed care business. We believe the government managed care business has very attractive growth characteristics, demographically and politically. We aspire to provide high-quality care to our members, while driving to the lowest cost of delivery to produce attractive margins in this high-growth industry. We believe we have the right strategy and the right team to execute our sustaining profitable growth agenda. We remain extremely confident, that we can achieve our long-term targets of 13% to 15% premium revenue growth and 15% to 18% earnings per share growth. As I conclude my remarks, I want to express my gratitude to our management team and our nearly 13,000 Molina colleagues. Their skill, dedication, and steadfast service continue to form the foundation for everything we have achieved and everything we will achieve in the years to come. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Keim, for some additional color on the financials. Mark? Matt, we are forecasting that when the public health emergency ends and all the redetermination activity is fulfilled that we will end up with half the members we gained during the pandemic. And we say that, because the low-wage service economy has been rapid. The stimulus money is still out there. And time has shown that over past recessions, when Medicaid rolls have swelled, they stay increased when the crisis abates. So we're pretty confident that, membership in Medicaid post-pandemic will exceed Medicaid membership pre-pandemic. Now, over what period is a matter of judgment as you know the PHE is now planned to extend into mid-January, which means the first members with notice periods and membership notification periods the first members are eligible to roll off the books on April 1. So we have forecasted that we will be down $500 million in revenue in 2022, an additional $800 million in revenue in 2023. So the $2.9 billion of revenue gained will result in $1.6 billion of permanent revenue gain, $500 million in 2022, an additional $800 million in 2023, $2.9 billion moving to $1.6 billion. Sure, Josh. A few of them are a function of time as our acquisitions mature. And then, the wild card obviously is how much COVID will persist into 2022. And so I'll turn it to Mark to give you an accounting of how we see the $6 emerging overtime. Mark? Sure. Yes our repositioning of the product portfolio is really a function of the enhanced subsidies. We can move and our brokers can move members from bronze to silver at zero premium and high subsidies with no additional cost to the member and they get a plan with a higher actuarial value. So, it's better for the member. From our perspective, silver is more flexible and easier to manage. It's easier to develop risk scores and there's more pricing flexibility in silver. So, we're going to emphasize more silver next year than we did this year. Our bronze/silver mix is about 55-45 this year and will be more skewed to silver next year. So that's sort of our mix currently. Clearly, the special enrollment period was another headwind this year. And with the change in the rules that now people eligible -- people that will be eligible are only below 150% of federal poverty means that the membership flows some special enrollment in the industry should be a lot lower. In our case, we estimate about half of what they were this year. We added 200,000 members in special enrollment this year. And with the cutoff at 150% of FPL that's likely to be at least cut half. So, we're forecasting that our membership will be flat to down off the 719,000 this year which means revenue will probably be flat to down. But no matter where revenue lands, it's going to be earnings accretive in 2022. We are very confident in hitting our mid-single-digit pretax margin target next year even on a membership base that's likely to be lower than this year. I think, I'll turn it over to Mark, but yes as we add the acquisitions they're going to be accretive. We're buying them very efficiently. Many of these properties are underperforming. Our integration teams are hitting if not exceeding our accretion targets. So as we add these acquisitions they're going to be accretive. We wouldn't do them if they aren't. But yes, the AgeWell acquisition now that affinity is in the fold has served to sort of increase our forward look on embedded earnings. We still say it's $6 plus. And again how much of that emerges next year and into 2023. We'll wait until we give specific guidance on 2022 in February. Well, the special enrollment period ended in August. We believe that we'll see attrition between now and the end of the year. It will likely be lower than it was pre-pandemic, but we have 719,000 members now. We'll lose some and probably end the year maybe slightly below 700,000. Sure. Justin on the marketplace and the COVID impacts there are really two factors. One is geography. Our marketplace business just happens to be in places that were hit hard particularly by the Delta variant Florida, Texas, California, Washington. So it follows the geography and follows our Marketplace footprint. The second, we believe is our marketplace population skews younger. Unvaccinated people that are being infected, but the cost of care on an episode basis is actually a bit lower. But the infection rate is high and the younger population that tends to be unvaccinated. So those are the two factors that we cite that seems to disproportionately affect our Marketplace business. On the California RFP, we believe we're very, very optimistic about our ability not only to hold on the business we have but to grow it. As you know we're very strong in L.A. We're very strong at Sacramento and San Diego. We have a nice business in the Inland Empire. We have a great reputation with the state. We perform well. We do all the hard work we need to do with respect to community involvement and charitable giving. We're in really good shape for the California RFP which supposedly at least the latest announcement will come in early 2022 for a contract date for 1/1/24. So we're in good shape in California. We're very optimistic about our prospects not only to maintain what we have but to grow. A little bit of both. I mean, we priced to a medical cost trend in Marketplace that was somewhat reflective of the increased baseline that we experienced this year impacted by COVID. Second, so we priced to an increased medical cost trend. Second, the special enrollment members were experiencing a loss ratio in the mid-90s. And if that membership \u2013 some of that membership will renew, some of it will go away. And then of course, next year, the special enrollment period will be targeted at folks with 150% of federal property level incomes are down. So we believe that, the special enrollment period membership will be half or less than half of what it was this year. So all of those factors combined put us in really good shape and producing our mid-single-digit pre-tax margin target for next year, but as I said, likely on membership that is flat to down over 2021. Sure. I'll try to parse through the various questions. On the first one, we did assume in our pricing that some of the SEP membership would renew, and therefore increased the cost trend that we included in pricing to accommodate that. Now, how many actually do renew and how many just joined because of an episodic health care condition and will leave, we'll have to wait and see. But we did price as though some of those renewal members \u2013 some of those SEP members would renew, and we think we've captured that in the medical cost trend we've included in our pricing. It's \u2013 I'll answer the first part of that Kevin, and then I'll turn it to Mark. It's really difficult, because even though our COVID results quarter-to-quarter costing us $77 million and $1 per share seem like it was stable. The stories are quite different. In the second quarter the COVID direct cost of care were less than $100 million and it's twice that in the third quarter. And what ends up happening is when the COVID infection rates are really, really high and it's really intense, you get this counterbalancing impact of utilization curtailment. People fear of contagion of going in for services, hospitals and treating these COVID patients and can't accept discretionary and elective procedures and the like. So the third quarter, actually was one of our highest quarters, if not the highest quarter for the COVID, the direct cost of COVID-related care, but significantly offset with utilization curtailment. And then the corridors the risk-sharing quarters just kind of title through on a very stable basis. It's going to follow the infection rate, which makes it very hard to forecast. As we sit here today, we hope that Delta variant is over. We hope there are no additional variant, but we just don't know that yet. And so as we get closer to February, when we announce our fourth quarter results, we'll probably have a better handle. We will have a better handle on what we think COVID will do in 2022 and we'll announce it then. But the quarter-to-quarter results seem stable on a net basis, but the components are quite volatile, and it just follows the infection rate. We think we're in good shape for growth next year. We're not giving a growth expectation on Medicare at this stage. But you're absolutely right, we launched some traditional Medicare Advantage products in some of our DSNP footprint to capture folks who had incomes that didn't allow them to be eligible for DSNP but were low income, using the same network, the same facilities and access to the same type of brokers who operate in those various areas. So, we're really optimistic about our growth prospects as we launched our MAPD products to low-income individuals and our expanded DSNP footprint and additional penetration in our existing footprint. We still do not have the market share that we think we can ultimately obtain in our DSNP footprint. So we're really bullish on the prospects during AEP this year, bearing in mind that we do get to enroll certain people throughout the year as well. Sure, Scott. Our strategy is somewhat different than many of our competitors' strategies. What we're targeting are the working poor. We leverage our Medicaid network. We leverage our Medicaid network pricing, and our target market is fully or highly subsidized members. We are not targeting the mass affluent. That's number one. Number two, we did price this year to make sure that we hit our target margins of mid single-digit pre-tax. The way we look at this business is the revenue is going to float up and down with a fixed target margin at mid single digits. We will price for mid single-digit margins, and we'll let the revenue float up and down. The marketplace is a residual market. It flexes up and down with Medicaid eligibility. It's 15 million members nationally strong. We're in great shape in the markets that we choose to play in and our target market is somewhat different than the target markets for many of these new competitors. So, wherever revenue and membership plans for next year, it will be earnings accretive in 2022. David I always say that whether redetermination is a headwind or a tailwind depends on where you're measuring it from. We like to think of it as a value creator, because we measure it from pre-pandemic. The Medicaid roles will be higher post pandemic that may work pre even though year-over-year there might be some choppiness. No. We -- in many of our markets and in many of our products, it appears to be business as usual, particularly as the Delta variant started to dissipate in late September into October. In August, the Delta variant was really intense and August utilization was very high and we saw some curtailment there. But again, it flexes up and down -- almost routinely flexes up and down with the intensity of COVID infection rate. So in many of our states and many of our products, the curtailment is no longer, but it flexes up and down with the COVID infection rate. No, I think -- yeah, I would say we've made some judgments around redetermination. Certainly, how much COVID persists into next year that you've identified and then there's just the puts and takes of managed care. Are you capturing -- are you managing medical cost to your trend. But I can't think of an event-driven -- a headwind that is kind of event driven or situationally driven. Just managing managed care, but we have a proven ability to always manage our medical costs to the trend that is embedded in our products and the pricing of our products. So we're pretty comfortable that 2022 could shape up to be a very attractive year for us. Well, four states have eliminated them. Many of the states that are on January one rating cycles have not yet declared whether they will continue them or not. The only one that actually is formally continued into next year is in Mississippi. So it's hard to say. As they're announced either to be eliminated or to persist and whether they persist for a full-year or half year is just largely unknown at this time. So I think your point, is a correct one. It -- whatever happens we'll likely expect our quarter-to-quarter results next year. Whether it's back-ended or front-end loaded, I don't know yet, but the only corridor that actually has been announced that persists into 2022 because their state fiscal year straddles the calendar year is Mississippi. No. On the Medicaid, I'll answer the Medicaid question, first. On the Medicaid side we're pretty comfortable that wherever membership goes, how much reduced membership there is because of redetermination, the margins that we're experiencing on the population should be thought of as our portfolio averages. There's actually very little evidence that the acuity of the population shifted all that much. And if it did, some of the states enacted retroactive acuity adjustments that are already embedded in our earnings and then of course, there's the corridors where any favorable experience is given back through the corridor and not through your rates. So we're pretty comfortable saying when you think about membership increases and decreases in Medicaid, due to redetermination we think of it in terms of portfolio averages. On the Marketplace side, we really increased the trend we embedded in the pricing of our product, which I think is demonstrated through some of the filings, you've seen where we really tried to capture not only the higher baseline due to COVID but the higher acuity on what we are experiencing very early in the special enrollment process. And that coupled with the fact that we should have fewer members coming into our membership roles in special enrollment next year. Again gives us great confidence that that mid-single-digit pre-tax margin is attainable. Operator?"

I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?\nJoe Zubretsky: Thank you, Julie and good morning. Today, we will provide you with updates on several topics. We will present our financial results for the second quarter 2021, we will update our 2021 guidance, and we will summarize the status of our growth initiatives and outlook for the future. Let me start with the second quarter highlights. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $3.40 with adjusted net income of $199 million and premium revenue of $6.6 billion. The 88.4% medical care ratio demonstrates solid performance while managing through pandemic-related medical cost challenges that increased the ratio by 110 basis points. The net effect of COVID decreased net income per diluted share by approximately $1. We managed to a 6.9% adjusted G&A ratio reflecting continued discipline in cost management which allowed us to harvest the benefits of scale produced by our substantial growth. We produced an adjusted after-tax margin of 2.9% meeting our second quarter expectations. Our six-month year-to-date performance highlighted by an 87.6% MCR, a 7% adjusted G&A ratio, and a 3.4% after-tax margin were all squarely in line with our year-to-date expectations. This allowed us to produce as projected 60% of our full year earnings guidance in the first half of the year. And we accomplished all of this as we generated approximately 50% year-over-year premium revenue growth and successfully integrated businesses, representing approximately $5 billion in annual revenue. In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter performance. We executed well, delivered solid operating earnings, and continue to drive our growth strategy. Let me provide some commentary highlighting our second quarter performance. First, I note that year-over-year comparisons are less meaningful than they would be in a typical year. The second quarter of last year was the first full quarter of the COVID pandemic and was distorted by the significant positive net effect of COVID that characterized that early phase of the crisis. In contrast, the current quarter was negatively impacted by the net effect of COVID. As a result, sequential comparisons are the more meaningful reflection of underlying business performance and will be the focus of our comments this morning. In the second quarter, we produced premium revenue of $6.6 billion, a 4% increase over the first quarter of 2021, reflecting increased membership across our portfolio. We ended the quarter with approximately 4.7 million members, an increase of 91,000 members over the first quarter of 2021. Our Medicaid enrollment at the end of the quarter was approximately 3.9 million members, an increase of 69,000 over the first quarter of 2021. This increase was due primarily to the continuing suspension of Medicaid redeterminations, although this growth catalyst seems to have moderated. Our Medicare membership was 130,000 at the end of the quarter, an increase of 4,000 and in line with our growth plan. Our Marketplace membership were 638,000 at the end of the quarter, representing growth of 18,000 over the first quarter of 2021 due to lower-than-expected attrition rates and membership additions during the extended open enrollment period. Turning now to our medical margin performance in the second quarter by line of business. Our Medicaid business achieved a medical care ratio of 89%. While we are dealing with the impacts of the pandemic on utilization and medical cost as well as the continuing temporary impact of the risk corridors, we continue to execute on the underlying fundamentals. Our well-diversified portfolio of state contracts across all dimensions of the Medicaid product suite is performing well. We continue to deliver high-quality care at a reasonable cost particularly to high acuity populations. The underlying rate environment is stable. Our hallmark medical management capabilities continue to deliver appropriate clinical outcomes for our members while achieving strong financial results. Our Medicare results were excellent having posted a medical care ratio of 87.6%. We continue to produce excellent MCRs and margins in this portfolio of high-acuity lives in both our D-SNP product and the MMP programs. Although our results were moderately depressed due to COVID utilization and despite the temporary risk score softness for the current year, the underlying results were squarely in line with our expectations. Our Marketplace results have been significantly impacted by direct cost of COVID-related care, as we posted a medical care ratio of 84.8% in the quarter. Many of the new members we attracted were in regions disproportionately affected by COVID including California, Michigan, Texas and Washington. With nearly 500 basis points of pressure on the MCR in each of the first two quarters, we can and should achieve mid-single-digit pretax margins as the pandemic subsides. In short, our second quarter and first half results across the entire portfolio continue to demonstrate our ability to produce excellent margins while growing top line revenue and successfully managing through the ongoing clinical and financial impacts of the pandemic. Turning to our 2021 guidance, beginning with premium revenue. For 2021, we now project premium revenue to be more than $25 billion, a 37% increase over the full year 2020 and a $1 billion increase from our previous guidance. Specifically, our premium revenue guidance now includes Medicaid enrollment benefiting from the expected extension of the public health emergency period and the associated pause on membership redeterminations, which we are now projecting through the end of the fourth quarter. Recall that for each month the public health emergency has extended beyond the month of September, it increases our full year revenue outlook by $150 million. Our updated guidance also contemplates the impact from retaining pharmacy-related premium revenue in California, New York and Kentucky due to postponement of and changes to their respective pharmacy carve-out initiatives and updated Marketplace revenue reflecting the strong enrollment and retention performance mentioned previously. We expect to end 2021 with approximately 590,000 marketplace members. We have excluded from our premium revenue guidance any impact of the Affinity and Cigna acquisitions. We expect the Affinity acquisition to close in the fourth quarter, representing upside to our premium revenue guidance in 2021 and we expect the Cigna acquisition to close in January 2022. Turning now to earnings guidance. We are raising our full year 2021 earnings guidance and now expect to end the year with adjusted earnings of no less than $13.25 per share, an increase from our prior guidance of no less than $13 per share. We remain on track for full year after-tax margins of at least 3%. Specifically, the increase to our 2021 earnings guidance reflects our underlying outperformance, the increase in our revenue guidance and the associated margin, offset by a $1 increase in the net cost of COVID, which we now expect to be $2.50 per share for the full year. We have been cautious in projecting our back half earnings due to a variety of exogenous factors. The Delta variant adds variability to any utilization forecast. While highly contagious, the Delta variant disproportionately affects the unvaccinated. Older and more vulnerable population cohorts have significantly higher vaccination rates. As a result, the Delta variant cases result in proportionately fewer hospital admissions and lower per admission costs, moderating the potential impact. In addition, it remains unknown how quickly and to what extent utilization will return to normal levels. This will depend upon the strength of the economy, consumer behavior provider capacity and the emergence of any new COVID variants. There is an inherent level of uncertainty with regard to new marketplace member acuity levels and their susceptibility to COVID infection and the COVID-related risk-sharing corridors create an added element of variability. Turning now to an update on our growth initiatives. We continue to see many actionable opportunities in our acquisition pipeline, which remains an important aspect of our growth strategy. Our M&A team is fully deployed and is working an active list of health plan targets in our core businesses. Our acquisition strategy remains focused on buying stable membership and revenue streams, particularly focused on underperforming properties. Our M&A integration team is also fully deployed and successfully migrating our acquired properties to Molina operating infrastructure and cost structure, to ensure we deliver the earnings accretion we expected. To-date, we are on track to meet or exceed our earnings accretion commitments. We continue to pursue to new Medicaid procurement opportunities. We have contract winning capabilities, an aggressive in-state ground game and a winning proposal writing platform. We are confident that we will continue to win new contracts that will contribute to our growth trajectory in 2022 and 2023. Finally, some comments about the longer-term outlook for our business. The current rate environment is stable and rational. We now have confirmed data points to support the continued belief that the Medicaid risk sharing corridors related to the declared public health emergency will be eliminated, as the COVID pandemic subsides. Pandemic-related corridors have already been eliminated for the 2022 state fiscal years in California, New York, South Carolina and Michigan, with momentum towards similar outcomes in other states. The current Medicare risk score shortfall phenomenon is temporary, as our 2022 bids did fully account for the current assessment of next year's risk scores. We continue to be bullish about the performance of our acquired businesses. The operational integrations are proceeding as or better than planned and we have high confidence in achieving our original accretion estimates and possibly, even exceeding them. In the context of the pandemic subsiding and our acquisitions maturing, the incremental embedded earnings power of the business, as it exists today, is meaningful. With the increased outlook for the net negative effect of COVID, our incremental embedded earnings power is now more at $5 above our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance. In short, our pro forma run rate, after the natural relaxation of these temporary constraints, would produce adjusted earnings per share comfortably in the mid-teens and an after-tax margin of approximately 4%. I look forward to sharing more about our future growth plans and longer-term strategy at our Investor Day on September 17. At our Investor Day, we will provide you with an initial 2022 revenue outlook. We will also provide you with an updated view of our long-term targets, for revenue growth for our three lines of business, operating metrics for our three lines of business and enterprise margin, net income and earnings per share expectations. And, as importantly, as has been our hallmark style, we will provide you with our detailed playbook for achieving those results. We will continue not just to declare our goals, but to show you the transparency and specificity, how we will achieve them. Suffice it to say, we are an inherently high-growth businesses and have demonstrated an ability to grow the top line and maintain an attractive margin profile, even during a global pandemic. The political, legislative and regulatory environments are all positive catalysts and the social demographic profile of the U.S. population remains in significant need of the social safety net we manage. As I conclude my remarks, I want to express my gratitude to our management team and our nearly 13,000 Molina colleagues. Their skill dedication and steadfast service, continue to form the foundation, for everything we have achieved and everything we will achieve in the years to come. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Keim, for some additional color on the financials. Mark?\nMark Keim: Thank you, Joe. This morning, I will discuss some additional details of our second quarter performance, and then turn to our growth strategy, the balance sheet and some thoughts on our 2021 guidance. Beginning with some detailed commentary about our second quarter results. The net effect of COVID, negatively impacted second quarter results by $77 million or approximately $1 a share. This increased the second quarter MCR by 110 basis points to 88.4%. The impact was higher than our expectations and negatively affected all three lines of business. We experienced high COVID-related inpatient costs early in the quarter, which tapered off as the quarter progressed. We also saw increases in professional and outpatient costs, which we attribute to what, may be the return to normal pre-COVID utilization patterns. In Medicaid, the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $25 million and accounted for a 40 basis point increase that is included within our reported 89% MCR. The first quarter Medicaid MCR had a 150-basis-point benefit due to COVID, which substantially explains the sequential increase in MCR. We continue to expect the full year Medicaid MCR to be in the high 80s. In Medicare, the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $17 million, increasing the MCR by 200 basis points to 87.6% in the quarter. The first quarter Medicare MCR was increased by 400 basis points due to COVID. Sequentially, the MCR improved, driven by this lower net effect of COVID and improved underlying performance compared to the first quarter. We anticipate a full year Medicare MCR in the high 80s. In Marketplace, the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $35 million, increasing the MCR by 480 basis points. The first quarter Marketplace MCR included a similar impact from the net effect of COVID, which increased the first quarter MCR by approximately 500 basis points. The resulting sequential increase in MCR versus the first quarter reflects the normal seasonality associated with members reaching their policy deductible limits. Due to the higher-than-expected impact from the net effect of COVID in the first half of the year, we now expect Marketplace pretax margins to moderate to low single digits. We expect that when the COVID pandemic subsides, our Marketplace pretax margin will be squarely on target, with our mid-single-digit pretax margin expectations. Turning now to our balance sheet. We received $145 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, which brought our parent company cash balance to $564 million at the end of the quarter. We have ample capacity to fund the announced acquisitions. At our current margins, we generate significant excess cash and additional debt capacity. After funding our announced pending acquisitions, we will have year-end acquisition capacity of over $1.4 billion. At the multiples we have paid in recent transactions, this gives us the ability to drive $3 billion to $4 billion in annualized revenue growth. More importantly, at our current level of performance, this level of acquisition capacity is generated each year. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and our reserve position remains strong. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter represented 48 days of medical cost expense, unchanged from the first quarter. Prior year reserve development in the second quarter of 2021 was modestly favorable, but any P&L impact was mostly absorbed by the COVID-related risk corridors. Debt at the end of the quarter is 2.2 times trailing 12-month EBITDA. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 50%. However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.7 times and 43% respectively. These metrics reflect a conservative leverage position. A few additional comments, related to our earnings guidance. We raised full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to be no less than $13.25 per share, which reflects the following. Our underlying outperformance, an increase in our revenue guidance and the associated margin, the net effect of COVID expectations which has increased by $1 per share and is now expected to be approximately $2.50 per share for the full year, and continued caution in forecasting utilization trends in the remaining six months of the year due to the COVID pandemic. In a typical year, the seasonality of utilization and timing of open enrollment periods resulted in third quarter earnings being higher, than fourth quarter earnings. However this year, we expect second half earnings to be distributed more evenly between the quarters, due to the net effect of COVID and particularly the impact of risk sharing corridors. As Joe discussed, we believe the incremental embedded earnings power of the company is in excess of $5. This is composed of several items. The increased net effect of COVID, which is now expected to create a $2.50 per share decrease, that should dissipate as the pandemic subsides. Medicare risk score disruption that created approximately $1 a share overhang; and as we obtain our target margins on Magellan Complete Care and Kentucky, and once Affinity and Cigna acquisitions are closed and synergized, we expect to achieve additional adjusted earnings per share of at least $2. This embedded earnings power does not represent 2022 guidance, but rather an accounting of the dynamic impacts that are temporarily depressing our earnings profile. There are many other items that will affect our actual earnings guidance for 2022 including several possible scenarios for the impact of Medicaid membership redeterminations. In short, our 2021 earnings jump-off point into 2022 is very strong. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead Kevin.\nKevin Fischbeck: All right, great. Thanks. I wanted to maybe just dig into that last comment about the earnings power. And I guess your point about potential offset from redeterminations. Is there any framework that you guys have that you think would be helpful to think about how much redeterminations is adding to this base number, and how to think about the timing of when that might roll off?\nJoe Zubretsky: Kevin this is Joe. Over the net last number of months, we have formed a view of what's going to happen with the suspension of the redetermination pause. And the way we now characterize it, we believe that this will be a very organized and orderly approach to move any members that are no longer eligible for Medicaid into the uninsured population or other forms of insurance. Aside three things. One, there is a reasonable possibility that the federal government actually extends the public health emergency. Second, many states are actually applying for types of waivers to manage their populations in different ways. Illinois has suggested to CMS that they want to continue the public health emergency for another year. New Jersey wants to redetermine its members on their anniversary day. So we believe that this is going to be a very, very orderly transition. Nobody wants to have Medicaid members stranded without coverage. Bearing in mind, we have over 70 million members nationally that need to go through a redetermination process and the states just do not have the capacity to do this in the mandated six-month period of time, which suggests to us that the government and CMS may actually relax that standard and allow for more time to transition these members. So we're looking at this as a protracted, orderly event over 2022 perhaps even into 2023 to make sure that all Medicaid members who are no longer eligible have the opportunity to age into the D-SNP product to income up into a highly subsidized marketplace product or as they obtain work end up in the employer sponsored insurance marketplace. We will provide a variety of scenarios of what that might look like for 2022 at our Investor Day on September 17th.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay. That's really helpful. I guess maybe just to wrap that up then. How do you think about the margin on that business? I guess in general you would think that anyone redetermined is probably a better risk pool and therefore a little bit higher margin, should we be thinking about it that way, or are there offsets to be considering there?\nJoe Zubretsky: There are offsets. There is no question that if you look at medical economic data or actuarial data that generally speaking duration of membership causes acuity to decline, the level of acuity to decline. There's no question about that. The longer they're on the roles, the less acute they are. Two factors as you referenced offsets. One, many states took that into consideration in setting rates. So it's already in the rates that we have a lower acuity population. And second, bear in mind that while the volume won't get picked up by the risk corridors, any excess margin on those members is surely picked up by the risk corridors and 30% of our revenue is already in the 100% tier. So, yes, I would look at -- there is a margin on those members, but the margin is likely no more than a low-single-digit target margin. But we view that as accreting off the books over a very long period of time in a very orderly fashion as I suggested. But I -- the way we look at it is the margin on those members is no greater or less than the average margin of the portfolio.\nKevin Fischbeck: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead Matt.\nMatt Borsch: Yes, good morning. Thank you. I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit more about the utilization and medical cost components during the second quarter. Specifically, I'm trying to understand, how the direct cost of COVID, have evolved in Marketplace and Medicaid relative to the non-COVID, if you're able to talk about non-COVID relative to sort of normal baseline? I'm just a little confused on, how much pressure you're getting directly from COVID in particular.\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, Matt. Let me start with what we call just traditional normal utilization of healthcare services. We believe and the data supports it, that the healthcare system is coming back to operating at full capacity, not greater than full capacity and not lower, but at full capacity, which means utilization, all those types of procedures the elective and discretionary procedures wellness visits, preventive care, primary care visits for checkups are all coming back to pre-pandemic levels. In fact, in our forecast, we actually trend off of 2019 medical cost data to make sure, that we appropriately capture pre-pandemic utilization. In our forecast for the entire year, we trended off that full utilization baseline. So we are assuming that the system has reverted back to pre-pandemic levels of utilization, for all those types of services that were either deferred or eliminated during the pandemic. Now with respect to COVID, the situation while similar is actually somewhat different today, than earlier in the pandemic. We are seeing the Delta variant and the Delta variant is affecting the unvaccinated. The unvaccinated tend to be younger and healthier, than folks that were vaccinated. So while we're seeing prevalence of Delta variant COVID infection rates, fewer of those incidents are requiring hospital stays. So much of the care is being provided in an outpatient ambulatory setting. And the cases that do require an admission, the length of stay is shorter. There is a lower incidence of ICU utilization which is expensive and lower utilization of ventilator which suggests lower acuity. So while we're seeing a prevalence of Delta variant COVID-related cases, the severity of those cases is a lot lower than the severity of the cases earlier in the pandemic. During the quarter, we experienced about $95 million of COVID-related direct costs of inpatient care during the quarter, but it really tapered off. It was about $50 million in the first month of the quarter about $30 million in the second and about $15 million or so in the last month of the quarter. We expect that to research. The Delta variant infection rate is popping particularly in states that have low vaccination rates. And in our full year forecast, we have forecasted forward, a continuation of COVID-related cost of care, at a certain level. Hopefully, that's helpful to your analysis.\nMatt Borsch : Yeah. It's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from A.J. Rice from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead, A.J.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi everybody. Maybe just to drill down a little bit on the public exchanges and what you're seeing in the marketplace environment. Is -- it sounds like the costs are running a little bit ahead or somewhat ahead. And it sounds like, a lot of that is COVID related. But can you talk about why that is you think? And also is the demographics of the new enrollees you've seen over the course of this year, different than those that are traditionally been attracted to a Molina public exchange product?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, A.J. The first thing I would say is, the infection rate is very geographically correlated, it's probably the best word to use and so, while we wrote a lot of new membership in Texas, Washington, California, Mississippi where the infection rates are high. So we wrote new business, at the beginning of the pandemic, not knowing and not realizing that pandemic is going to last this long and persist this long. So granted, we wrote new membership purposely wrote to grow, at the early stages of the pandemic and the pandemic has persisted longer than anybody imagined. Second, any product that has an extended enrollment period or a special enrollment period has the aspect of inviting adverse selection. If you can buy insurance anytime you want, you can buy it when you need it. Now we don't think the adverse selection bias in this population was that high, but it's there. And if you're writing with a selection bias into markets that are COVID prone you're going to get COVID cases. And when you strip it all back, a 500 basis points of pressure in each of the first two quarters is the reason we are running in low-single-digit margins and not mid-single digit. And we absolutely believe as the pandemic subsides we'll produce an 80%-ish MCR for the entire year and be squarely in line with those low-single-digit margins and able to lift that into mid-single-digits into 2022.\nA.J. Rice: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead, Steven.\nSteven Valiquette: Hey, thanks. Good morning everybody. So, I guess just in relation to the Medicaid redeterminations being pushed out. I guess on the one hand you mentioned the incremental $150 million of revenue for every month of extension which I think you also stated several quarters ago. Then you mentioned again today that the impact has moderated somewhat. I think you talked more about a $300 million to $400 million incremental revenue opportunity in the remainder of 2021 last quarter, if it's delayed further. So I guess I wanted to just confirm that within the $1 billion revenue guidance increase for this year how much of it is tied to the redetermination just to triangulate all the numbers? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, I just said in my remarks partially due to redeterminations the Marketplace and the pharmacy carve-outs. I'll turn to Mark to walk you through the bridge. \nMark Keim: Yes. So on the incremental $1 billion that we're talking about $450 million is the simple math on three additional months of the redetermination 3x $150 million. We've also done better on marketplace as you've seen in our numbers both on OEP and SEP. We've picked up additional members as that market grows. That's probably another $150 million on full year. Then as we mentioned some of the pharmacy carve-outs there were three states: California New York and Kentucky all of which extended any view on carve-outs which gave us about another $400 million. So you put those numbers together that's your $1 billion in upside. \nOperator: Steven does it answer all your questions? Do you have any further questions? \nSteven Valiquette: That's good for me. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, Justin. \nJustin Lake: Thanks, good morning. Appreciate the comments on the RFP pipeline Joe during your prepared remarks. Just hoping you might be able to give us a little more color there in terms of what are some of the key RFPs we might be focused on over the next 12 to 18 months? And then anything on how you think California shapes up? I know that's probably a couple of years out from any kind of decision, but obviously an important state. \nJoe Zubretsky: Sure Justin. Well as I said, we continue to be very bullish on our prospects in these open procurements in new states. And there are a couple of states that we believe Ohio and Michigan which will be putting behavioral and LTSS into managed care sometime in the near future. And those are states where we already have entrenched relationships and feel very good about it. But on the new, new '22 Nevada, Rhode Island, Georgia, Iowa, Tennessee is out there. Now we may or may not bid on all of those. They have to be sequenced appropriately with reprocurement bids and other things we're working on. But those are four to five -- Georgia if I didn't mention it those are the four or five that come to mind over the next three or four years. And based on our track record we feel we have contract winning capabilities a great proposal writing team. And we've really, really amped up our in-state round game building those relationships years and years in advance of the procurement in order to really understand the state program and to have those relationships that are so important to a state contract. Your last part of your question sorry, was California. Look they've announced a year-end dropping of the RFP. We've been working on it in 2022. So we're working on that timeline. But these things have been delayed before. It's the first reprocurement in California I think in over a decade. I'm pretty sure about that. It's a complicated state. Every state as you know has a different managed care model. But we do really, really well in L.A., in Sacramento, in San Diego, the Inland Empire and we have every reason to believe that not only do we have every opportunity to defend our current positions but to actually grow in a few other counties where we currently don't play. \nJustin Lake: Thanks for the color.\nJoe Zubretsky: You\u2019re welcome, Justin.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Dave.\nDave Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. In your Quantification of the $5 of earnings power I think the last couple of dollars were from fully synergizing acquisitions. I wanted to make sure, I was clear on whether that was just counting those that you've completed, or if you were also including those that you talked about completing at the end of this year and early next year? So that's my first question. \nJoe Zubretsky: Dave there's a little bit of both and I'll kick it to Mark for the actual bridge. \nMark Keim: Yes. So recall the numbers total around $5.50, $2.50 of that was the net effect of COVID. We talked about the Medicare risk scores. You're pointing to the remaining $2 of M&A upside. Dave that splits evenly between $1 of incremental run rate on MCC in Kentucky. Those are the ones that are already in current year performance. So in their second year, they'll mature to their full run rate that gives you $1. Then, the ones we've announced but not closed, will be in next year's performance that will give you the remaining dollar.\nDave Windley: Got it. And then, Joe you talked about, and I think you really touched on this maybe last time, but talked about the risk corridors going away and that you feel pretty comfortable that that's going to happen. In thinking about, the states kind of heads they win, tails you lose on this that they put the risk corridors in to get money back when you were underspending. But, in the event that the utilization bounces back and your overspending on medical costs they've taken them away, is that -- how do you protect against that risk?\nJoe Zubretsky: It's a really good question, because as you know, these risk corridors by rule have to be symmetrical. So anything you potentially give up on the upside, you get on the downside. Look, the targets have been set at a point where as a company our operators, Mark Keim, our Financial Officer, myself don't even think about winning -- getting money back on the downside. It's possible, but we think the -- not we think, we know there's lots of non for profit players that may get checks from the state governments, because they're operating above. We are not operating anywhere near that target, which is why our corridors are substantial. We have some of the highest margins in the industry in many of our states, and therefore whether $1 of outperformance is related to COVID or just skill. You get it back in the corridor, if you're in 100% tier. So, we don't think about being protected on the downside, because we have -- we're not skating that close to the edge at all. And if we were, and that's just a different set of problems that we're not operating in an excellent way, we're nowhere near that territory. So, we're not at all relying on or put value in the upside protection of the corridors.\nDave Windley: Got it. Thanks. And then a quick last one. You talked about the quantification of your buying power for new plans and fairly substantial amount and the ability to regenerate that as your cash flow. Where does your infrastructure stand? Are you making steady investments in infrastructure to be able to onboard that much revenue, or do you face a step function at some point in the next couple of years?\nJoe Zubretsky: I'll give you a quick answer and then kick it to Mark, but we have a fully ramped up integration team. And our analysis is we have lots of runway many billions of dollars of revenue to add in our current infrastructure with our current cloud-supported applications, our data centers which are now moving to the cloud. The entire infrastructure physical infrastructure, application infrastructure, all the on-the-shelf applications we use, all have the scalability to take on billions of dollars of additional revenue without hitting a step function. It's a question I've been asked before and one I look at very seriously. There's not a big bang technology redo here because of our acquisition strategy. Our platforms can handle the additional scale.\nDave Windley: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead, Scott.\nScott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask a question just on going back to the Marketplace, and just thinking about philosophically how you've approached the pricing strategy for 2022, targeting -- wanted to get to that, mid-single-digit margins that you feel that you have underneath the COVID impacts. But, just interested as we think about how you sort of input it sort of continued COVID impact into next year, potential acuity dynamics relating to the members that came in this year, particularly related to some of the extended Biden SEPs. And then, I guess just game theory to around the competitive environment with some of these newer players in particular, having been more aggressive on some of the pricing strategies. Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure. This is a business, the Marketplace business, putting a frame around it. First of all, it's a strategic adjacency to Medicaid. It follows our Medicaid footprint. It leverages our Medicaid network, both in terms of network adequacy and pricing. So it's very much attached to the Medicaid business. The marketplace business will follow the Medicaid footprint. So, strategically it fits. At just over 10% of revenue, it's sort of in line with an adjunct, an adjacency that fits nicely into the portfolio. So we like the position it has. To your point about 2022, you manage this business for margin first and membership later. Because it's a blind bid business, where you're being against competitors not knowing exactly how they're going to bid, you have to be careful. And so, when we established our 2022 bidding strategy, I'll stay away from geographic detail, because I'd be giving away proprietary information, we pretty much used the higher cost baseline that we've been experiencing here early in the year. Now, that means somebody else took a flyer on it and decided that as the pandemic subsides all this cost goes away and they beat us on price fine. We'll give up the member and we'll make sure we have mid-single-digit margins. So in this business, because of the blind bid strategy, because of the inherent movement of members, who will move for price we are pricing for margin over membership, but we believe we will continue to have a very robust and profitable business into next year, but again following our Medicaid footprint. \nScott Fidel: Got it. Thanks. And then just one follow-up question. Just given some of these unique dynamics particularly relating to the corridors when looking at the balance of PPS that you're expecting over the rest of the year, any insights you're willing to provide us just in terms of how the split may look between 3Q and 4Q?\nMark Keim: Sure. In a typical year, you'd see a little better margin in the third quarter and a little taper off into fourth. In my prepared remarks, what I said is that, we expect to see more of a level dynamic between Q3 and Q4. Partly, it's \u2013 the utilization patterns just aren't like what we've seen in a normal year, right? What we've got continuing COVID potentially the Delta variant going into Q3 here. But the other thing is just the leveling effect of these corridors will level out the performance from one quarter to the next. So not quite the normal seasonality you'd expect to see. You might model something a little more level between the quarters.\nScott Fidel: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead, Josh.\nJosh Raskin: Thanks. Good morning. I want to get back to the sort of scalability question. You look at the quarter and you added $280 million of revenues and G&A was only up $11 million. And I know, typically, we hear about new revenues coming in at less profitable levels and I know a large majority of that's on the MLR line and not necessarily the G&A. But just trying to figure out you guys are now at an industry-leading level. And so how sustainable is that G&A? And do you think there's investments needed in certain areas? And maybe more specifically just where are the \u2013 is it cost savings that are coming, or is it really just leverage on new revenues?\nJoe Zubretsky: Josh, we continue to be disciplined on the cost line. And when we talk about fixed cost leverage, our hope is not a strategy. You don't hope that it happens you actually manage through it. You bring on the Cigna book of business an additional $1 billion of revenue. We can run it with half the people that we're running it before, because of our presence in Texas. And at the corporate headquarters, you don't need to add more accountant's lawyers and HR people in order to manage the business. So we have a zog and nog strategy in terms of corporate overhead. And when we're bringing on bolt-on and tuck-ins in our existing geographies, we make sure that, we appropriately resource the business to make sure that every member and provider is getting the service they need for that we use local scale and only take on the variable cost to run the business. And Mark and his finance team and the operators are really disciplined about doing that, which is why we've said many, many times and we'll say it again on the 17th that whatever MLR pressure exists in this business, and its managed care, so it always exists, we believe can be overcome, if we're successful in our growth strategy with fixed cost leverage. And we're already starting to drive our SG&A ratio down below 7% on a consolidated basis. It's a lot lower than that in Medicaid. And obviously, Medicare brings it up. Medicare has a mid-teens G&A ratio. So the mix effect will affect that. But we have every intention of driving this ratio, given our growth trajectory down to the 6s.\nJosh Raskin: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Stephen.\nStephen Baxter: Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Just similar to how you broke down the incremental premiums that are included in guidance. It seems like, there's an implied $1.25 of incremental earnings power, when you think about raising the guidance and flagging the extra dollar from COVID. So I was wondering, if you could similar to how you talked about the extra $850 of Medicaid revenues and extra $150 million of exchange premiums inside of that. Any sense of what the extra $125 million breaks down to in terms of the drivers there? That would be helpful. Thanks.\nMark Keim: Sure. I'll take that in a couple of chunks. Obviously, the headwind there was the dollar of incremental net COVID. So offsetting that's $1.25 of upside, right? It's probably broken into two components. I think about $0.80 of that $1.25 just relates to that $1 billion incremental revenue, we talked about. Maybe an additional $0.45, it's just on our underlying performance a little bit in the front half of the year and what we see for the second half of the year. And that's things like our payment integrity programs our UM our CM, and some of that SG&A discipline that Joe was just talking about. So the $0.80 on the $1 billion to $0.45 just our underlying performance that gets you to about $1.25.\nJoe Zubretsky: And the point you made is really an important one. Even though the guide is optically only $0.25 higher on, if you want to normalize for COVID, we're adding $1.25 really true earnings performance and margin on revenue, which is a really good trajectory as a jumping off point into 2022.\nStephen Baxter: Thanks. And then just one follow-up on the question Kevin asked before about redeterminations. When you talk about the overall redetermination population, you're not really thinking that's going to carry a different margin than the broader Medicaid book. Are you talking about a gross margin or an operating margin? And I guess how do you think about dealing with SG&A deleveraging potential for that population? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: We did -- I mean we did have to take on additional resources to service the increased population. So it's not as though we leveraged the complete infrastructure and therefore it's only contribution margin it's going to leave we will have some SG&A that we'll be able to depart the company. We took on contract resources. We worked overtime. We added resources in our call centers and our clinical services and those will be able to be relieved when that membership -- when that membership attrits. And again the point I want to make is we're at 680,000 members up organically since the beginning of the pandemic. That number is likely to be 750,000 by the end of the year. It's not going to the zero. The structural level of unemployment particularly in the lower rate service economy that economy was far more stressed than the average economy. The stimulus checks and the unemployment benefits are still out there. And that number is just not going to zero. Now where it lands we don't know, but we believe and it's been proven over 35 years that any time there's been an event usually some type of economic event or a recession where Medicaid enrollment has swelled that -- post event, the membership, the enrollment nationally has stayed at an increased level for years after the crisis has abated. So we're pretty comfortable in saying that 750,000 are likely to be up will not go to zero. Where it lands we don't know but the unemployment rates in many of our states particularly in the low wage service economy are still quite high.\nMark Keim: And the only other thing to sprinkle on top of that is we'll talk more about this at Investor Day, but as that redetermination the revenues from that obviously form a headwind. You talked a little bit about G&A leverage component. But don't forget that will be offset with our growth initiatives our new M&A right? We've got two deals that will affect next year, new procurements and our other organic growth initiatives. So it's still a growing revenue pie and still a very attractive G&A proposition.\nStephen Baxter: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Joe. This morning, I will discuss some additional details of our second quarter performance, and then turn to our growth strategy, the balance sheet and some thoughts on our 2021 guidance. Beginning with some detailed commentary about our second quarter results. The net effect of COVID, negatively impacted second quarter results by $77 million or approximately $1 a share. This increased the second quarter MCR by 110 basis points to 88.4%. The impact was higher than our expectations and negatively affected all three lines of business. We experienced high COVID-related inpatient costs early in the quarter, which tapered off as the quarter progressed. We also saw increases in professional and outpatient costs, which we attribute to what, may be the return to normal pre-COVID utilization patterns. In Medicaid, the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $25 million and accounted for a 40 basis point increase that is included within our reported 89% MCR. The first quarter Medicaid MCR had a 150-basis-point benefit due to COVID, which substantially explains the sequential increase in MCR. We continue to expect the full year Medicaid MCR to be in the high 80s. In Medicare, the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $17 million, increasing the MCR by 200 basis points to 87.6% in the quarter. The first quarter Medicare MCR was increased by 400 basis points due to COVID. Sequentially, the MCR improved, driven by this lower net effect of COVID and improved underlying performance compared to the first quarter. We anticipate a full year Medicare MCR in the high 80s. In Marketplace, the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $35 million, increasing the MCR by 480 basis points. The first quarter Marketplace MCR included a similar impact from the net effect of COVID, which increased the first quarter MCR by approximately 500 basis points. The resulting sequential increase in MCR versus the first quarter reflects the normal seasonality associated with members reaching their policy deductible limits. Due to the higher-than-expected impact from the net effect of COVID in the first half of the year, we now expect Marketplace pretax margins to moderate to low single digits. We expect that when the COVID pandemic subsides, our Marketplace pretax margin will be squarely on target, with our mid-single-digit pretax margin expectations. Turning now to our balance sheet. We received $145 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, which brought our parent company cash balance to $564 million at the end of the quarter. We have ample capacity to fund the announced acquisitions. At our current margins, we generate significant excess cash and additional debt capacity. After funding our announced pending acquisitions, we will have year-end acquisition capacity of over $1.4 billion. At the multiples we have paid in recent transactions, this gives us the ability to drive $3 billion to $4 billion in annualized revenue growth. More importantly, at our current level of performance, this level of acquisition capacity is generated each year. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and our reserve position remains strong. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter represented 48 days of medical cost expense, unchanged from the first quarter. Prior year reserve development in the second quarter of 2021 was modestly favorable, but any P&L impact was mostly absorbed by the COVID-related risk corridors. Debt at the end of the quarter is 2.2 times trailing 12-month EBITDA. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 50%. However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.7 times and 43% respectively. These metrics reflect a conservative leverage position. A few additional comments, related to our earnings guidance. We raised full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to be no less than $13.25 per share, which reflects the following. Our underlying outperformance, an increase in our revenue guidance and the associated margin, the net effect of COVID expectations which has increased by $1 per share and is now expected to be approximately $2.50 per share for the full year, and continued caution in forecasting utilization trends in the remaining six months of the year due to the COVID pandemic. In a typical year, the seasonality of utilization and timing of open enrollment periods resulted in third quarter earnings being higher, than fourth quarter earnings. However this year, we expect second half earnings to be distributed more evenly between the quarters, due to the net effect of COVID and particularly the impact of risk sharing corridors. As Joe discussed, we believe the incremental embedded earnings power of the company is in excess of $5. This is composed of several items. The increased net effect of COVID, which is now expected to create a $2.50 per share decrease, that should dissipate as the pandemic subsides. Medicare risk score disruption that created approximately $1 a share overhang; and as we obtain our target margins on Magellan Complete Care and Kentucky, and once Affinity and Cigna acquisitions are closed and synergized, we expect to achieve additional adjusted earnings per share of at least $2. This embedded earnings power does not represent 2022 guidance, but rather an accounting of the dynamic impacts that are temporarily depressing our earnings profile. There are many other items that will affect our actual earnings guidance for 2022 including several possible scenarios for the impact of Medicaid membership redeterminations. In short, our 2021 earnings jump-off point into 2022 is very strong. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Yes. So on the incremental $1 billion that we're talking about $450 million is the simple math on three additional months of the redetermination 3x $150 million. We've also done better on marketplace as you've seen in our numbers both on OEP and SEP. We've picked up additional members as that market grows. That's probably another $150 million on full year. Then as we mentioned some of the pharmacy carve-outs there were three states: California New York and Kentucky all of which extended any view on carve-outs which gave us about another $400 million. So you put those numbers together that's your $1 billion in upside. Yes. So recall the numbers total around $5.50, $2.50 of that was the net effect of COVID. We talked about the Medicare risk scores. You're pointing to the remaining $2 of M&A upside. Dave that splits evenly between $1 of incremental run rate on MCC in Kentucky. Those are the ones that are already in current year performance. So in their second year, they'll mature to their full run rate that gives you $1. Then, the ones we've announced but not closed, will be in next year's performance that will give you the remaining dollar. Sure. In a typical year, you'd see a little better margin in the third quarter and a little taper off into fourth. In my prepared remarks, what I said is that, we expect to see more of a level dynamic between Q3 and Q4. Partly, it's \u2013 the utilization patterns just aren't like what we've seen in a normal year, right? What we've got continuing COVID potentially the Delta variant going into Q3 here. But the other thing is just the leveling effect of these corridors will level out the performance from one quarter to the next. So not quite the normal seasonality you'd expect to see. You might model something a little more level between the quarters. Sure. I'll take that in a couple of chunks. Obviously, the headwind there was the dollar of incremental net COVID. So offsetting that's $1.25 of upside, right? It's probably broken into two components. I think about $0.80 of that $1.25 just relates to that $1 billion incremental revenue, we talked about. Maybe an additional $0.45, it's just on our underlying performance a little bit in the front half of the year and what we see for the second half of the year. And that's things like our payment integrity programs our UM our CM, and some of that SG&A discipline that Joe was just talking about. So the $0.80 on the $1 billion to $0.45 just our underlying performance that gets you to about $1.25. And the only other thing to sprinkle on top of that is we'll talk more about this at Investor Day, but as that redetermination the revenues from that obviously form a headwind. You talked a little bit about G&A leverage component. But don't forget that will be offset with our growth initiatives our new M&A right? We've got two deals that will affect next year, new procurements and our other organic growth initiatives. So it's still a growing revenue pie and still a very attractive G&A proposition."

            "name": "Joe Zubretsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Julie and good morning. Today, we will provide you with updates on several topics. We will present our financial results for the second quarter 2021, we will update our 2021 guidance, and we will summarize the status of our growth initiatives and outlook for the future. Let me start with the second quarter highlights. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $3.40 with adjusted net income of $199 million and premium revenue of $6.6 billion. The 88.4% medical care ratio demonstrates solid performance while managing through pandemic-related medical cost challenges that increased the ratio by 110 basis points. The net effect of COVID decreased net income per diluted share by approximately $1. We managed to a 6.9% adjusted G&A ratio reflecting continued discipline in cost management which allowed us to harvest the benefits of scale produced by our substantial growth. We produced an adjusted after-tax margin of 2.9% meeting our second quarter expectations. Our six-month year-to-date performance highlighted by an 87.6% MCR, a 7% adjusted G&A ratio, and a 3.4% after-tax margin were all squarely in line with our year-to-date expectations. This allowed us to produce as projected 60% of our full year earnings guidance in the first half of the year. And we accomplished all of this as we generated approximately 50% year-over-year premium revenue growth and successfully integrated businesses, representing approximately $5 billion in annual revenue. In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter performance. We executed well, delivered solid operating earnings, and continue to drive our growth strategy. Let me provide some commentary highlighting our second quarter performance. First, I note that year-over-year comparisons are less meaningful than they would be in a typical year. The second quarter of last year was the first full quarter of the COVID pandemic and was distorted by the significant positive net effect of COVID that characterized that early phase of the crisis. In contrast, the current quarter was negatively impacted by the net effect of COVID. As a result, sequential comparisons are the more meaningful reflection of underlying business performance and will be the focus of our comments this morning. In the second quarter, we produced premium revenue of $6.6 billion, a 4% increase over the first quarter of 2021, reflecting increased membership across our portfolio. We ended the quarter with approximately 4.7 million members, an increase of 91,000 members over the first quarter of 2021. Our Medicaid enrollment at the end of the quarter was approximately 3.9 million members, an increase of 69,000 over the first quarter of 2021. This increase was due primarily to the continuing suspension of Medicaid redeterminations, although this growth catalyst seems to have moderated. Our Medicare membership was 130,000 at the end of the quarter, an increase of 4,000 and in line with our growth plan. Our Marketplace membership were 638,000 at the end of the quarter, representing growth of 18,000 over the first quarter of 2021 due to lower-than-expected attrition rates and membership additions during the extended open enrollment period. Turning now to our medical margin performance in the second quarter by line of business. Our Medicaid business achieved a medical care ratio of 89%. While we are dealing with the impacts of the pandemic on utilization and medical cost as well as the continuing temporary impact of the risk corridors, we continue to execute on the underlying fundamentals. Our well-diversified portfolio of state contracts across all dimensions of the Medicaid product suite is performing well. We continue to deliver high-quality care at a reasonable cost particularly to high acuity populations. The underlying rate environment is stable. Our hallmark medical management capabilities continue to deliver appropriate clinical outcomes for our members while achieving strong financial results. Our Medicare results were excellent having posted a medical care ratio of 87.6%. We continue to produce excellent MCRs and margins in this portfolio of high-acuity lives in both our D-SNP product and the MMP programs. Although our results were moderately depressed due to COVID utilization and despite the temporary risk score softness for the current year, the underlying results were squarely in line with our expectations. Our Marketplace results have been significantly impacted by direct cost of COVID-related care, as we posted a medical care ratio of 84.8% in the quarter. Many of the new members we attracted were in regions disproportionately affected by COVID including California, Michigan, Texas and Washington. With nearly 500 basis points of pressure on the MCR in each of the first two quarters, we can and should achieve mid-single-digit pretax margins as the pandemic subsides. In short, our second quarter and first half results across the entire portfolio continue to demonstrate our ability to produce excellent margins while growing top line revenue and successfully managing through the ongoing clinical and financial impacts of the pandemic. Turning to our 2021 guidance, beginning with premium revenue. For 2021, we now project premium revenue to be more than $25 billion, a 37% increase over the full year 2020 and a $1 billion increase from our previous guidance. Specifically, our premium revenue guidance now includes Medicaid enrollment benefiting from the expected extension of the public health emergency period and the associated pause on membership redeterminations, which we are now projecting through the end of the fourth quarter. Recall that for each month the public health emergency has extended beyond the month of September, it increases our full year revenue outlook by $150 million. Our updated guidance also contemplates the impact from retaining pharmacy-related premium revenue in California, New York and Kentucky due to postponement of and changes to their respective pharmacy carve-out initiatives and updated Marketplace revenue reflecting the strong enrollment and retention performance mentioned previously. We expect to end 2021 with approximately 590,000 marketplace members. We have excluded from our premium revenue guidance any impact of the Affinity and Cigna acquisitions. We expect the Affinity acquisition to close in the fourth quarter, representing upside to our premium revenue guidance in 2021 and we expect the Cigna acquisition to close in January 2022. Turning now to earnings guidance. We are raising our full year 2021 earnings guidance and now expect to end the year with adjusted earnings of no less than $13.25 per share, an increase from our prior guidance of no less than $13 per share. We remain on track for full year after-tax margins of at least 3%. Specifically, the increase to our 2021 earnings guidance reflects our underlying outperformance, the increase in our revenue guidance and the associated margin, offset by a $1 increase in the net cost of COVID, which we now expect to be $2.50 per share for the full year. We have been cautious in projecting our back half earnings due to a variety of exogenous factors. The Delta variant adds variability to any utilization forecast. While highly contagious, the Delta variant disproportionately affects the unvaccinated. Older and more vulnerable population cohorts have significantly higher vaccination rates. As a result, the Delta variant cases result in proportionately fewer hospital admissions and lower per admission costs, moderating the potential impact. In addition, it remains unknown how quickly and to what extent utilization will return to normal levels. This will depend upon the strength of the economy, consumer behavior provider capacity and the emergence of any new COVID variants. There is an inherent level of uncertainty with regard to new marketplace member acuity levels and their susceptibility to COVID infection and the COVID-related risk-sharing corridors create an added element of variability. Turning now to an update on our growth initiatives. We continue to see many actionable opportunities in our acquisition pipeline, which remains an important aspect of our growth strategy. Our M&A team is fully deployed and is working an active list of health plan targets in our core businesses. Our acquisition strategy remains focused on buying stable membership and revenue streams, particularly focused on underperforming properties. Our M&A integration team is also fully deployed and successfully migrating our acquired properties to Molina operating infrastructure and cost structure, to ensure we deliver the earnings accretion we expected. To-date, we are on track to meet or exceed our earnings accretion commitments. We continue to pursue to new Medicaid procurement opportunities. We have contract winning capabilities, an aggressive in-state ground game and a winning proposal writing platform. We are confident that we will continue to win new contracts that will contribute to our growth trajectory in 2022 and 2023. Finally, some comments about the longer-term outlook for our business. The current rate environment is stable and rational. We now have confirmed data points to support the continued belief that the Medicaid risk sharing corridors related to the declared public health emergency will be eliminated, as the COVID pandemic subsides. Pandemic-related corridors have already been eliminated for the 2022 state fiscal years in California, New York, South Carolina and Michigan, with momentum towards similar outcomes in other states. The current Medicare risk score shortfall phenomenon is temporary, as our 2022 bids did fully account for the current assessment of next year's risk scores. We continue to be bullish about the performance of our acquired businesses. The operational integrations are proceeding as or better than planned and we have high confidence in achieving our original accretion estimates and possibly, even exceeding them. In the context of the pandemic subsiding and our acquisitions maturing, the incremental embedded earnings power of the business, as it exists today, is meaningful. With the increased outlook for the net negative effect of COVID, our incremental embedded earnings power is now more at $5 above our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance. In short, our pro forma run rate, after the natural relaxation of these temporary constraints, would produce adjusted earnings per share comfortably in the mid-teens and an after-tax margin of approximately 4%. I look forward to sharing more about our future growth plans and longer-term strategy at our Investor Day on September 17. At our Investor Day, we will provide you with an initial 2022 revenue outlook. We will also provide you with an updated view of our long-term targets, for revenue growth for our three lines of business, operating metrics for our three lines of business and enterprise margin, net income and earnings per share expectations. And, as importantly, as has been our hallmark style, we will provide you with our detailed playbook for achieving those results. We will continue not just to declare our goals, but to show you the transparency and specificity, how we will achieve them. Suffice it to say, we are an inherently high-growth businesses and have demonstrated an ability to grow the top line and maintain an attractive margin profile, even during a global pandemic. The political, legislative and regulatory environments are all positive catalysts and the social demographic profile of the U.S. population remains in significant need of the social safety net we manage. As I conclude my remarks, I want to express my gratitude to our management team and our nearly 13,000 Molina colleagues. Their skill dedication and steadfast service, continue to form the foundation, for everything we have achieved and everything we will achieve in the years to come. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Keim, for some additional color on the financials. Mark? Kevin this is Joe. Over the net last number of months, we have formed a view of what's going to happen with the suspension of the redetermination pause. And the way we now characterize it, we believe that this will be a very organized and orderly approach to move any members that are no longer eligible for Medicaid into the uninsured population or other forms of insurance. Aside three things. One, there is a reasonable possibility that the federal government actually extends the public health emergency. Second, many states are actually applying for types of waivers to manage their populations in different ways. Illinois has suggested to CMS that they want to continue the public health emergency for another year. New Jersey wants to redetermine its members on their anniversary day. So we believe that this is going to be a very, very orderly transition. Nobody wants to have Medicaid members stranded without coverage. Bearing in mind, we have over 70 million members nationally that need to go through a redetermination process and the states just do not have the capacity to do this in the mandated six-month period of time, which suggests to us that the government and CMS may actually relax that standard and allow for more time to transition these members. So we're looking at this as a protracted, orderly event over 2022 perhaps even into 2023 to make sure that all Medicaid members who are no longer eligible have the opportunity to age into the D-SNP product to income up into a highly subsidized marketplace product or as they obtain work end up in the employer sponsored insurance marketplace. We will provide a variety of scenarios of what that might look like for 2022 at our Investor Day on September 17th. There are offsets. There is no question that if you look at medical economic data or actuarial data that generally speaking duration of membership causes acuity to decline, the level of acuity to decline. There's no question about that. The longer they're on the roles, the less acute they are. Two factors as you referenced offsets. One, many states took that into consideration in setting rates. So it's already in the rates that we have a lower acuity population. And second, bear in mind that while the volume won't get picked up by the risk corridors, any excess margin on those members is surely picked up by the risk corridors and 30% of our revenue is already in the 100% tier. So, yes, I would look at -- there is a margin on those members, but the margin is likely no more than a low-single-digit target margin. But we view that as accreting off the books over a very long period of time in a very orderly fashion as I suggested. But I -- the way we look at it is the margin on those members is no greater or less than the average margin of the portfolio. Sure, Matt. Let me start with what we call just traditional normal utilization of healthcare services. We believe and the data supports it, that the healthcare system is coming back to operating at full capacity, not greater than full capacity and not lower, but at full capacity, which means utilization, all those types of procedures the elective and discretionary procedures wellness visits, preventive care, primary care visits for checkups are all coming back to pre-pandemic levels. In fact, in our forecast, we actually trend off of 2019 medical cost data to make sure, that we appropriately capture pre-pandemic utilization. In our forecast for the entire year, we trended off that full utilization baseline. So we are assuming that the system has reverted back to pre-pandemic levels of utilization, for all those types of services that were either deferred or eliminated during the pandemic. Now with respect to COVID, the situation while similar is actually somewhat different today, than earlier in the pandemic. We are seeing the Delta variant and the Delta variant is affecting the unvaccinated. The unvaccinated tend to be younger and healthier, than folks that were vaccinated. So while we're seeing prevalence of Delta variant COVID infection rates, fewer of those incidents are requiring hospital stays. So much of the care is being provided in an outpatient ambulatory setting. And the cases that do require an admission, the length of stay is shorter. There is a lower incidence of ICU utilization which is expensive and lower utilization of ventilator which suggests lower acuity. So while we're seeing a prevalence of Delta variant COVID-related cases, the severity of those cases is a lot lower than the severity of the cases earlier in the pandemic. During the quarter, we experienced about $95 million of COVID-related direct costs of inpatient care during the quarter, but it really tapered off. It was about $50 million in the first month of the quarter about $30 million in the second and about $15 million or so in the last month of the quarter. We expect that to research. The Delta variant infection rate is popping particularly in states that have low vaccination rates. And in our full year forecast, we have forecasted forward, a continuation of COVID-related cost of care, at a certain level. Hopefully, that's helpful to your analysis. Sure, A.J. The first thing I would say is, the infection rate is very geographically correlated, it's probably the best word to use and so, while we wrote a lot of new membership in Texas, Washington, California, Mississippi where the infection rates are high. So we wrote new business, at the beginning of the pandemic, not knowing and not realizing that pandemic is going to last this long and persist this long. So granted, we wrote new membership purposely wrote to grow, at the early stages of the pandemic and the pandemic has persisted longer than anybody imagined. Second, any product that has an extended enrollment period or a special enrollment period has the aspect of inviting adverse selection. If you can buy insurance anytime you want, you can buy it when you need it. Now we don't think the adverse selection bias in this population was that high, but it's there. And if you're writing with a selection bias into markets that are COVID prone you're going to get COVID cases. And when you strip it all back, a 500 basis points of pressure in each of the first two quarters is the reason we are running in low-single-digit margins and not mid-single digit. And we absolutely believe as the pandemic subsides we'll produce an 80%-ish MCR for the entire year and be squarely in line with those low-single-digit margins and able to lift that into mid-single-digits into 2022. Sure, I just said in my remarks partially due to redeterminations the Marketplace and the pharmacy carve-outs. I'll turn to Mark to walk you through the bridge. Sure Justin. Well as I said, we continue to be very bullish on our prospects in these open procurements in new states. And there are a couple of states that we believe Ohio and Michigan which will be putting behavioral and LTSS into managed care sometime in the near future. And those are states where we already have entrenched relationships and feel very good about it. But on the new, new '22 Nevada, Rhode Island, Georgia, Iowa, Tennessee is out there. Now we may or may not bid on all of those. They have to be sequenced appropriately with reprocurement bids and other things we're working on. But those are four to five -- Georgia if I didn't mention it those are the four or five that come to mind over the next three or four years. And based on our track record we feel we have contract winning capabilities a great proposal writing team. And we've really, really amped up our in-state round game building those relationships years and years in advance of the procurement in order to really understand the state program and to have those relationships that are so important to a state contract. Your last part of your question sorry, was California. Look they've announced a year-end dropping of the RFP. We've been working on it in 2022. So we're working on that timeline. But these things have been delayed before. It's the first reprocurement in California I think in over a decade. I'm pretty sure about that. It's a complicated state. Every state as you know has a different managed care model. But we do really, really well in L.A., in Sacramento, in San Diego, the Inland Empire and we have every reason to believe that not only do we have every opportunity to defend our current positions but to actually grow in a few other counties where we currently don't play. You're welcome, Justin. Dave there's a little bit of both and I'll kick it to Mark for the actual bridge. It's a really good question, because as you know, these risk corridors by rule have to be symmetrical. So anything you potentially give up on the upside, you get on the downside. Look, the targets have been set at a point where as a company our operators, Mark Keim, our Financial Officer, myself don't even think about winning -- getting money back on the downside. It's possible, but we think the -- not we think, we know there's lots of non for profit players that may get checks from the state governments, because they're operating above. We are not operating anywhere near that target, which is why our corridors are substantial. We have some of the highest margins in the industry in many of our states, and therefore whether $1 of outperformance is related to COVID or just skill. You get it back in the corridor, if you're in 100% tier. So, we don't think about being protected on the downside, because we have -- we're not skating that close to the edge at all. And if we were, and that's just a different set of problems that we're not operating in an excellent way, we're nowhere near that territory. So, we're not at all relying on or put value in the upside protection of the corridors. I'll give you a quick answer and then kick it to Mark, but we have a fully ramped up integration team. And our analysis is we have lots of runway many billions of dollars of revenue to add in our current infrastructure with our current cloud-supported applications, our data centers which are now moving to the cloud. The entire infrastructure physical infrastructure, application infrastructure, all the on-the-shelf applications we use, all have the scalability to take on billions of dollars of additional revenue without hitting a step function. It's a question I've been asked before and one I look at very seriously. There's not a big bang technology redo here because of our acquisition strategy. Our platforms can handle the additional scale. Sure. This is a business, the Marketplace business, putting a frame around it. First of all, it's a strategic adjacency to Medicaid. It follows our Medicaid footprint. It leverages our Medicaid network, both in terms of network adequacy and pricing. So it's very much attached to the Medicaid business. The marketplace business will follow the Medicaid footprint. So, strategically it fits. At just over 10% of revenue, it's sort of in line with an adjunct, an adjacency that fits nicely into the portfolio. So we like the position it has. To your point about 2022, you manage this business for margin first and membership later. Because it's a blind bid business, where you're being against competitors not knowing exactly how they're going to bid, you have to be careful. And so, when we established our 2022 bidding strategy, I'll stay away from geographic detail, because I'd be giving away proprietary information, we pretty much used the higher cost baseline that we've been experiencing here early in the year. Now, that means somebody else took a flyer on it and decided that as the pandemic subsides all this cost goes away and they beat us on price fine. We'll give up the member and we'll make sure we have mid-single-digit margins. So in this business, because of the blind bid strategy, because of the inherent movement of members, who will move for price we are pricing for margin over membership, but we believe we will continue to have a very robust and profitable business into next year, but again following our Medicaid footprint. Josh, we continue to be disciplined on the cost line. And when we talk about fixed cost leverage, our hope is not a strategy. You don't hope that it happens you actually manage through it. You bring on the Cigna book of business an additional $1 billion of revenue. We can run it with half the people that we're running it before, because of our presence in Texas. And at the corporate headquarters, you don't need to add more accountant's lawyers and HR people in order to manage the business. So we have a zog and nog strategy in terms of corporate overhead. And when we're bringing on bolt-on and tuck-ins in our existing geographies, we make sure that, we appropriately resource the business to make sure that every member and provider is getting the service they need for that we use local scale and only take on the variable cost to run the business. And Mark and his finance team and the operators are really disciplined about doing that, which is why we've said many, many times and we'll say it again on the 17th that whatever MLR pressure exists in this business, and its managed care, so it always exists, we believe can be overcome, if we're successful in our growth strategy with fixed cost leverage. And we're already starting to drive our SG&A ratio down below 7% on a consolidated basis. It's a lot lower than that in Medicaid. And obviously, Medicare brings it up. Medicare has a mid-teens G&A ratio. So the mix effect will affect that. But we have every intention of driving this ratio, given our growth trajectory down to the 6s. And the point you made is really an important one. Even though the guide is optically only $0.25 higher on, if you want to normalize for COVID, we're adding $1.25 really true earnings performance and margin on revenue, which is a really good trajectory as a jumping off point into 2022. We did -- I mean we did have to take on additional resources to service the increased population. So it's not as though we leveraged the complete infrastructure and therefore it's only contribution margin it's going to leave we will have some SG&A that we'll be able to depart the company. We took on contract resources. We worked overtime. We added resources in our call centers and our clinical services and those will be able to be relieved when that membership -- when that membership attrits. And again the point I want to make is we're at 680,000 members up organically since the beginning of the pandemic. That number is likely to be 750,000 by the end of the year. It's not going to the zero. The structural level of unemployment particularly in the lower rate service economy that economy was far more stressed than the average economy. The stimulus checks and the unemployment benefits are still out there. And that number is just not going to zero. Now where it lands we don't know, but we believe and it's been proven over 35 years that any time there's been an event usually some type of economic event or a recession where Medicaid enrollment has swelled that -- post event, the membership, the enrollment nationally has stayed at an increased level for years after the crisis has abated. So we're pretty comfortable in saying that 750,000 are likely to be up will not go to zero. Where it lands we don't know but the unemployment rates in many of our states particularly in the low wage service economy are still quite high."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Julie Trudell. Please go ahead. \nJulie Trudell: Good morning and welcome to Molina Healthcare's first quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our first quarter earnings was distributed after the market close yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30-days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of the presentation, we remind you that the remarks made herein or as of today, Thursday, April 29, 2021, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our fourth quarter 2021 press release. During our call, we will be making certain Forward-Looking Statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding to the COVID-19 pandemic, the current environment, recent acquisitions, 2021 guidance and our longer-term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report for the 2020 year filed with the SEC, as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and our Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call and take your questions. Lastly, we want to invite you to attend our virtual 2021 investor day meeting scheduled for Friday, September 17, where we will share more about our future growth plan and longer term strategy. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Thank you, Julie and good morning. Today, we will provide you with updates on several topics. We will cover our financial results for the first quarter 2021. We will update our 2021 guidance in the context of our first quarter results and we will then provide an update on our growth initiatives and outlook for the future. Let me start with first quarter highlights. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of $4.44 with adjusted net income of $260 million and premium revenue of $6.3 billion. Our results for the quarter were strong across many dimensions. The 86.8% MCR demonstrates solid cost management fundamentals particularly in light of some of the challenges presented by the pandemic. We managed to a 7% adjusted G&A ratio as we continue to reinvest the benefits created by our strong enterprise wide fixed cost leverage in our growth initiatives. We produced an adjusted after tax margin of 4% squarely in line with our long term targets in exceeding our first quarter expectations. Our $4.44 adjusted earnings per share in the quarter were a 47% increase over the first quarter of 2020 and we accomplished all of this as we are generating 47% year-over-year premium revenue growth and successfully integrating businesses representing approximately $5 billion in annual revenue. In summary, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance as we executed well, delivered solid operating earnings, and continued to deliver on our growth strategy. Let me provide some commentary highlighting our first quarter performance. Premium revenue was $6.3 billion, a 47% increase over the first quarter of 2020 reflecting increased membership, in line with our expectations in both Medicaid and Medicare and exceeding our expectations in marketplace. We ended the quarter with 4.6 million managed care members, an increase of 573,000 over the fourth quarter 2020. Our Medicaid enrollment at the end of the quarter was 3.9 million members, an increase of 260,000 over the fourth quarter of 2020. This sequential increase was the result of strong organic growth of 63,000 members, as the suspension of redetermination in a slowly recovering economy continued to positively impact Medicaid membership. Although this growth catalyst seems to have moderated and growth of 197,000 members from the acquisition of Magellan Complete Care which closed on December 31. Our Medicare membership was 126,000 at the end of the quarter representing growth of 11,000 over the fourth quarter of 2020 which was primarily related to our acquisitions. Our marketplace membership grew by 302,000 in the quarter to 620,000, exceeding our initial forecast of at least 500,000 members. This growth was driven by several factors; strong product design and competitive pricing, effectuation rates substantially higher than historical averages, lower than expected natural attrition rates, and the extended open and special enrollment periods. Turning now to our medical margin results for the quarter. Our first quarter 2021 MCR was 86.8%, reflecting modest COVID related utilization curtailment, severe winter weather, and the absence of a traditional flu season offset by the direct costs of COVID related care. While the net effect of COVID for the total company was negligible in the quarter in line with our expectations, the impact varied by line of business. Our Medicare and marketplace businesses experienced a disproportionately negative impact from the net effect of COVID exerting pressure on their respective MCRs. This was offset by a modest favorable net COVID impact in Medicaid. Some additional comments on performance by line of business. In the Medicaid business, we achieved an 87.5% medical care ratio for the first quarter performing in line with our expectations. In addition to the external factors mentioned previously, which were unusually favorable in the quarter, the medical care ratio was also supported by our performance and utilization management and payment integrity. A portion of our Medicaid outperformance was recaptured by the risk sharing corridors and impact which was well within our expectations. The corridors are designed such that they will act as a buffer to absorb some of the over and underperformance related to medical margin no matter how that performance is derived. Our Medicare business produced a medical care ratio of 90.3% for the first quarter. The medical care ratio was negatively impacted by higher than expected direct costs of COVID related care and the temporary industry wide challenge of risk score capture, which results in risk scores that do not fully reflect the acuity of the membership. The Medicare business performed as expected when normalized for these two discrete impacts. Finally, our marketplace business experienced a medical care ratio of 77.3% for the first quarter. The medical care ratio was negatively impacted by higher than expected direct costs of COVID related care as the COVID infection rate resurged in many of our marketplace geographies. We did however, achieve our pre-tax earnings target due to the increased membership volume. We continue to effectively manage our resources. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7%, identical to the 7% reported in the first quarter of 2020. Our performance reflects disciplined cost management and the benefits of fixed costs leverage produced by our substantial growth offset somewhat by the higher than targeted DNA ratios of our acquired businesses which will improve as our integrations progress. We are pleased with our first quarter results as we continue to demonstrate the ability to produce excellent margins while substantially growing top line revenue and managing through the ongoing effects of the pandemic. Turning through our 2021 guidance, beginning with premium revenue. For 2021, we now project premium revenue to be more than $24 billion a 31% increase over the full year 2020 and a $1 billion increase from our previous guidance. Specifically, our premium revenue guidance now includes Medicaid enrollment benefiting from the expected extension of the public health emergency period, and the associated pause on membership redeterminations, which we are now projecting through the end of the third quarter. Recall, we had said that for each month public health emergency is extended beyond the month of May it could increase our full year revenue outlook by $150 million and updated marketplace revenue reflecting the strong enrollment and retention performance mentioned previously. We expect to end 2021 with slightly more than 500,000 marketplace members in marketplace premium revenue growth is now expected to be over 50%. We have excluded from our premium revenue guidance any impact of the affinity and signal acquisitions. We do expect these transactions to close this year representing upside to our premium revenue in 2021. In summary, we are very pleased with our growth trajectory. Our growth is well balanced between a new contract win, organic growth, bolt on acquisitions, benefit expansions in our existing geographies, and greater penetration of our marketplace in Medicare products in our Medicaid footprint. Turning now to earnings guidance. We are raising our full year 2021 adjusted earnings guidance to be no less than $13 per share, an increase from our prior guidance of $12.50 to $13 per share. Specifically, the increase towards 2021 earnings guidance reflects the favorable impacts of the increase in our revenue guidance and the associated margin, the first quarter earnings outperformance, and the combined effect of other individually minor impacts such as the sequestration delay in Medicare. We have however, hedged our guidance due to a variety of exogenous factors. First and foremost, we are still in a pandemic which introduces a level of uncertainty with respect to any healthcare utilization forecast. We have continued to be cautious in forecasting utilization trends in the remaining nine months of the year as the COVID pandemic subsides. How quickly and to what extent utilization rebound will depend upon the strength of the economy, consumer behavior, provider capacity and the level of COVID infection rates. With respect to forecasting, our marketplace utilization trends we recognize there is an inherent level of uncertainty with regard to new member acuity levels which we will monitor closely and the risk sharing corners create an added element of variability. While any individual stake corridor can be a buffer to that state over or underperformance predicting in which states over or underperformance may occur can create an element of forecasting variability. Turning now to an update on our growth initiatives. We are very pleased to have been rewarded our major Medicaid contracts in the state of Ohio. We were awarded contracts in all three regions in the state maintaining our statewide presence. This re-procurement win is a testimony to our excellent service, innovative programs, strong relationships, and our reputation as a business partner that can be counted on. While Ohio did introduce at least one additional player to the statewide program, continuity of care is of the utmost importance to a Medicaid program. As such, we have every reason to believe our current business profile should not materially change. The agreement to acquire Cigna STAR+PLUS membership is yet another example of an accretive, strategic bolt on acquisition. The business serves approximately 50,000 ADB and MMP members across three regions in Texas. Full year 2020 revenue is approximately $1 billion. With a modest purchase price of $60 million, we project the acquisition will deliver returns well in excess of our cost of capital, benefit from local and enterprise operating leverage and will be immediately accretive. The expanded presence in Texas should position us well and the re-procurement should the state proceed with that process. Finally, some comments about the longer term outlook for our business. The current rate environment is stable and rational. We continue to believe that the Medicaid risk sharing corridors that were previously introduced are related to the declared public health emergency and will be eliminated as the COVID pandemic subsides. We continue to be bullish about the performance of our acquired businesses. The operational integrations are proceeding as or better than planned, and we have high confidence in achieving our original accretion estimates and possibly even exceeding them. In the context of the pandemic subsiding and our acquisitions maturing, the embedded earnings power of the business, as it exists today is at least $4 higher than our adjusted earnings per share guidance. The emergence of embedded earnings combined with our future growth creates a very attractive earnings growth outlook. Our first quarter performance demonstrates that our growth plan is working well. We have built sound operational infrastructure, which allows us to operationally execute and maintain these attractive margins. We have reinvigorated our platforms to drive organic membership growth. We have built winning RFP and M&A capabilities that have catalyzed our growth and accessing new opportunities and we continue to focus on capital allocation and free cash flow generation to create shareholder value. The political, legislative, and regulatory trends are positive for the businesses we are in and our management team is well established, disciplined, and laser focused on our mission to serve members and shareholders. I look forward to sharing more about our future growth plans and longer term strategy at our investor day in September. As I conclude my remarks, I want to express my gratitude to our management team and our nearly 13,000 Molina colleagues. Their skill, dedication and steadfast service formed the foundation for everything we have achieved and everything we will achieve in the years to come. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Keim for some additional color on the financials.\nMark Keim: Thank you Joe. And good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss some additional details on our first quarter performance, and then turn to our growth strategy balance sheet and some thoughts on our 2021 guidance. Beginning with some detailed commentary about our first quarter results there was virtually no incidence of the normal flu in the first quarter. Historically, a normal flu season would have resulted in $25 million to $40 million in medical costs in the first quarter. Severe winter weather resulted in unusually low utilization in many areas of the country in the month of February. While it's difficult to separate weather effects from other effects, there's no question it had an impact on the month. To the extent the types of services not utilized during the time are elective and discretionary, that utilization will likely begin to rebound. Much of the impact is timing. Well, the net effect of COVID wasn't aligned with our expectations and negligible to the quarter in total, the impacts were varied across our lines of business. We experienced higher direct cost of COVID related care in January, which then tapered off as the quarter progressed. We saw some pockets of non-COVID related utilization increases, but overall utilization was in line with expectations. In Medicaid, we generally experienced a modest utilization curtailment on inpatient and outpatient services. A significant portion of the resulting medical margin outperformance was recaptured by the COVID risk sharing corridors in several states. In contrast, our Medicare and marketplace businesses experienced disproportionately negative impacts due to an increase in direct cost of COVID related care in the quarter. The year-over-year MCR comparisons in these lines of businesses are less meaningful, as the current quarter includes these impacts from COVID and the first quarter of 2020 does not. In Medicare, the net effect of COVID increased the MCR by approximately 400 basis points in the quarter. In addition, the Medicare MCR was negatively impacted by the temporary challenge of risk scores that do not fully reflect the acuity of the membership. This is an industry wide issue that we mentioned when we gave our initial guidance. We're expecting COVID to dissipate through the year and anticipate four year Medicare MCRs in the high 80s. Marketplace experienced the high level of COVID cases early in the quarter which moderated throughout the quarter. Several of our markets were disproportionately impacted by COVID as a result of higher local infection rates. The COVID impacted marketplace increased the MCR by approximately 500 basis points in the quarter. With that said we expect the net effect of COVID to subside and continue to expect full year pre-tax margins in the mid single digit. I will now provide some commentary on our growth strategy beginning with M&A. Last week's announcement of our intent to acquire a Cigna Texas Medicaid and MMP business marks our fifth acquisition since our pivot to growth, ultimately reflecting the addition of 7 billion in annualized revenue. The Cigna transaction is expected to increase our Texas membership by 50,000, provide approximately a billion in annualized revenues, and drive accretion of at least $0.40 per diluted share in the first full year of ownership. This transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2021 and it's not included in our full year 2021 guidance. We now expect the Affinity transaction to close in the third quarter. Affinity is expected to increase our New York membership by approximately 300,000 provide approximately 1.5 billion in annualized revenue with the creation of $0.15 to $0.20 per diluted share in the first full year of ownership. The impact of the Affinity acquisition is also not included in our full year 2021 guidance. Acquisitions will continue to be a meaningful part of our growth strategy. While we are a scaled government sponsored managed care company, we are still at a size that our pipeline of smaller consolidation targets can have a meaningful impact on our growth rate. We see significant earnings growth from these acquired revenues. We have demonstrated our ability to fix underperforming businesses, have the discipline to harvest fixed cost leverage, and have every expectation of managing our acquisitions to margins that are reflective of our current portfolio performance. Our pipeline of M&A opportunities is robust. We continue to pursue bolt on acquisitions, single state plans, and provide our own plans. We will not pursue capability plates. We are at pure play premium risk bearing government sponsored managed care business, and we see significant growth opportunities within this space. Our strong cash flow makes the acquisition growth possible. At our current margins, we generate significant excess cash and additional debt capacity. Between cash on hand, near term cash flow, and additional debt capacity we currently have acquisition capacity of over 1.3 billion. At the multiples we have paid in recent transactions this gives us the current ability to drive well in excess of 3 billion in annualized revenue growth. And more importantly, at our current level of performance, this acquisition capacity is repeated and produced every single year. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and our reserve position remained strong. Days and claims payable at the end of the quarter represented 48 days of medical cost expense compared to 50 days in the fourth quarter, and 49 days in the first quarter of 2020. Prior year reserve development in the first quarter of 2021 was modestly favorable, but any P&L impact was absorbed by the COVID related risk corridors. Debt at the end of the quarter is 1.9 times trailing 12 month EBITDA. Our leverage ratio is 52%. However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash these ratios fall to 1.6 times and 47% respectively. Taken together, these metrics reflect a reasonably conservative leverage position. In the quarter, we repurchased an aggregate of approximately 577,000 shares for $122 million at an average price of approximately $211 per share. Our full year guidance continues to be based on 58.5 million shares. At the end of the quarter our parent company cash balance was 436 million. A few additional comments related to our earnings guidance. In raising our full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to be no less than $13 per share, the following assumptions are relevant. A higher proportion of medical margin performance will be absorbed by the risk sharing corridors over the remainder of the year. The net effect of COVID remains a net cost of approximately $1.50 per share for the full year and lastly we expect 55% to 60% of full year EPS to be produced in the first half of the year. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator. We are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Hi. Right. Thanks. Good morning. I guess I wanted to go to the source of the comments about $4 of upsides still to the guidance, I guess it sounded like the guidance raise was due in some part at least to re-determinations and the revenue and earnings from there, which obviously not something we would forecast going into next year. Does your $4 number now include the Cigna deal in there? Are there any kind of other puts and takes you're affirming the $50 COVID impact that component hasn't changed?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Let me summarize what is in our guidance Kevin, this is Joe. When we guided to no less than $13 this year, we are including an additional margin on $600 million of Medicaid revenue due to the extension of the re-determination clause. We're also including a margin on the additional $400 million of marketplace revenue due to the increased membership. We are then hedging our forecast due to the uncertainty related to utilization in the last nine months of the year. So very clearly increasing our guidance to no less than $13 a share. What we have said when we gave our original guidance and continued to say is that the net cost of COVID inside that forecast is $1.50 a share. And if you recall the way we measure the COVID impact is any impact of curtailment or suppression of utilization offset by the direct costs of COVID related care absorbed then by the risk sharing corridors. We continue to believe that will cost our earnings $1.50 a share. So if you look at the impact of COVID as being an overhang of $1.50, the disruption to Medicare rescoring costing about another dollar per share, and then extend our acquisitions to their full state of maturity we say the embedded earnings power of the business currently is $4 higher than our current year guidance.\nKevin Fischbeck: Yes, I guess that's what you said last quarter, too. But you've taken out the core number this year on in part on things that don't seem sustainable. So I guess I was just wondering if there's any other kind of moving pieces to it as well.\nJoseph Zubretsky: And to be clear of that $4, that's not a 2022 guidance number outlook. That is, as we sit here today, there are certain overhangs on the earnings, projection of the business that are causing our earnings to be lower this year than they otherwise would be when our acquisitions mature, and when COVID disappears. Obviously there will be a lot more puts and takes into next year. And when we give our outlook in September our investor day will give you a better look of what 2022 looks like. Obviously, the re-determination clause increasing revenue this year where does it peak, how far does it fall, how quickly does it a trip is going to be a major item in a year-over-year comparison. But with 47% revenue of premium revenue growth this year, we're not at all that concerned with the upticks of 2022 versus 2021 at this point.\nKevin Fischbeck: Yes. If I may just last question, you mentioned that the SCP membership right now the acuity is hard to forecast. Do you have any early data points around metal types or demographics on that enrollment that might give you some comfort that that's not going to be a significantly higher acuity population.\nJoseph Zubretsky: So anytime you take on new membership by its very nature, inherently, you don't yet understand the acuity of that population. I mean, you start with an assumption that if somebody buys insurance, they generally need it. But our bronze-silver mix is about what we forecasted for the year. We have improved dramatically in attaining risk scores. We've improved that operation from last year, we recall it was a performance glitch last year, we've improved on it. All I can say at this point is we know we've improved and attunity risk scores compared to ourselves. Obviously, we don't have the industry data yet to compare how we're doing to our competitors, which will ultimately decide what risk scores we've attained. But we are doing better compared to ourselves, we'll be able to give a much clearer forecast on utilization trends, generally marketplace, Medicaid and Medicare, when we report our second quarter, but at this time, it's very prudent just to remain cautious, given the effects of the pandemic as it is still in full throes here in the first quarter is divides into the second and third.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Robert Jones at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, this is Kevin on for Bob this morning. I just want to clarify that you've made some comments just about hedging as it relates to COVID. I was curious if there's anything that you're actually seeing today that would make you more cautious or if this is just reflecting some conservatism given the environments just generally uncertain. \nJoseph Zubretsky: So I mean, Robert, we tried to be clear on this. We're not implying or merely suggesting we're being conservative. We're declaring we're being conservative. As we work through the quarter-over-quarter effects of the pandemic starting all the way back in the second quarter of last year the mini and micro inflections up and down that occur are very geographically dispersed very much tied to local infection rates, very much tied now to the improvement in the acuity to population to the vaccination rate and opening up of economies. And it is the variation in modeling utilization for the balance of the other variation in the various models is so wide, that we believe it's prudent just to be very cautious on how fast utilization will rebound, when does it rebound to pre-COVID Levels, does it rebound fully to pre-COVID levels, where and when and how is very much a variant at this point and it just is very prudent to remain cautious on utilization for the balance of the year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That's helpful. And then just one quick follow up. I know you've touched on still thinking about the COVID headwind being a buck 50. I know last quarter, you also talked about the MRA headwind being $1. Is the dollar still very kind of headwind to think about, or as your assumptions change on that at all?\nJoseph Zubretsky: No, that's still a good number. The disruption and risk scoring cost about 300 basis points in our Medicare MCR for the quarter. If you can do the math on that, that's still pretty much the dollar for the year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Helpful. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe just two quick questions. One, we've heard some about the marketplace environment that maybe there's some shifting and competitive landscape, rush to more narrow network programs that maybe, there's also been an uptick in churn among the members. You're growing that better than you expected. Are you seeing any of that or how would you put any of that in perspective? \nJoseph Zubretsky: Yes. The competitive landscape hasn't changed all that much. Yes some of the new entrants came into some of our markets, and started to build market share in those markets. But we're a very niche business. We do not serve affluent suburban. We serve the working poor. We've always said we built our marketplace networks off of our Medicaid networks, we priced them off our Medicaid networks and we're seeking out fully and highly subsidized members that are on government assistance. This is clearly an extension of our Medicaid strategy servicing the working for you. We like the position we're in not only are we improving our performance and growing, but it's not right size in the portfolio. Early on as we started this journey three years ago, there was no question that the marketplace earnings were outsized in relation to the portfolio. Now with marketplace revenues, representing about 10% of the total margins, mid single digit. So the earnings about 10% of the total as well. It's positioned nicely in the portfolio, strategically leverages our Medicaid infrastructure and is now a very good complement, financially and operationally good complement to our Medicaid business.\nA.J. Rice: That's great. And then my follow up would be, on the risk corridor comments, I think original guidance had that being about a $250 million impact this year. It sounds like maybe it's a little more given how things have trended. But I wondered if you've updated that number and have you, it sounds like you're thinking at some point, these risk corridors got to roll off. Can you just tell us if you see any states that have actually begun to take action to eliminate these or what are you hearing as you talk to the states about any kind of timing around eliminating these risk corridors?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Sure A.J. When we gave initial guidance, we never actually parsed to the components curtailment, direct cost of COVID care or the corridors. We said that the components are highly variable but the fact that the corridors do exist they do act as a buffer that we were very comfortable in the projection that COVID in total net would be a drag on earnings of $1.50 per share and we continue to say that. We never actually gave a specific quarter or a number. And you really shouldn't put the quarter numbers going to flex up and down with curtailment in the direct costs of COVID related to care, that's how they work. So to me, it's really the net number that's really important. Obviously, if the component parts get materially different, maybe we report on that, but right now, saying it's going to cost us $1.50 a share is the best metric to hang on. With respect to your second question, yes there's positive momentum that not only suggests but is concluding that the risk sharing corridors were related to the public health emergency. They were fully intended to recapture the portion of the capitated rate that was never paid out on benefits due to the pandemic and there is growing momentum with many of our state customers, the actuarial community, the public policy funded etc, that these will disappear as the COVID pandemic subsides. In fact, New York did not introduce a risk sharing corridor for its 22 fiscal year, which started on April 1 and California publicly declared that it is not introducing a corridor for its 22 fiscal year, which starts on January 1 of 2022, and there's lots of good momentum legislatively, administratively in many other states that are suggesting that these were related to the public health emergency and will begin to fall away as the pandemic subsides. Obviously, as that happens, as they become enacted or not enacted, we see draft rates will report as we report our quarters.\nA.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks, good morning, everyone. One of the, first just to ask about the taxes deal with Cigna and seems like a very attractive price that you're paying on a price per revenue basis and obviously you are expecting it to be nicely accretive as well. So just want to get some more insight into essentially how you're able to acquire that asset for that type of pricing and maybe some insight into the existing margin profile? Is it underperforming now and you think that you'll be able to improve that improve on that or is the margin profile already running at a pretty solid level?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Hi Scott. On the price like willing buyer willing seller, and that's the price we agreed to and without an allocation of capital 6% of revenue is clearly attractive. Now it's all about the Texas re-procurement and how this positions us in that re-procurement. So bolting on a billion dollars of revenue to our Texas Medicaid business, which is $2 billion strong right now increasing it by 50% adding two new regions where we're not present overlap and third is very-very attractive to our statewide presence. The business is profitable, marginally profitable but again, we bring Texas scale, we bring a lot more infrastructure, and we're going to leverage the daylights out of our fixed cost structure in the state of Texas we will be able to improve the margins due to our existing presence. So attractively priced, will recover the purchase price with the two first years of cash flow making it a free option upon re-procurement.\nScott Fidel: Got it. And the second question, just wanted to sort of net out I guess the framing on the exchange business and obviously had to COVID costs in the first quarter that you're not expecting to recur throughout the year you're keeping your outlook conservative but at the same time you are keeping your mid single digit margin target in place for the hex business. So just interested in maybe the competition within that mid single digit margin view change a bit where you're maybe assuming a bit higher on the MLR and you're getting more G&A leverage off the growth or just trying to sort of sync up sort of thinking about that the conservative since you change the margin target? Thanks.\nJoseph Zubretsky: You're actually captured it perfectly. Our MCR will likely be in the mid to high 70s, where previously was in mid to low 70s. But we're getting to G&A leverage. Our G&A ratio is improving by 200 to 300 basis points, which, again, clearly puts us in the mid single digit pre-tax category. Now, there's a range around what pre-tax, single digit pre-tax means. But we have every reason to believe that given what we experienced in the first quarter, if the pandemic does subside, we get appropriate risk scores on the new membership that will achieve mid single digit margins even on the increased size of the business. Anytime you grow a business it puts pressure on margins but we're still committed to in forecasting that will be at mid single digits pre-tax even on the increased revenue.\nScott Fidel: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Morning.\nJustin Lake: First question a lot of talk about the federal emergency and the benefits of this year as you go through the year. Just wanted to get an idea of within that $4 of kind of upside you talked about in earnings power how much are you pulling out for the assumption if the Federal emergency goes away? So if that shuts off completely for 2022 and all those members leave, is there a number that you could share with us? I know that's not going to happen that way but just kind of understanding what you're pulling out of that earnings power of the 4 bucks?\nJoseph Zubretsky: The first answer to the very specific question you asked is no. That was an embedded earnings were wasn't a 2022 forecasts. It wasn't a bridge to 2022. It was, when these three or four factors disappear the earnings power of our business, the embedded earnings power is $4 higher. It was not a projection. It was certainly not a forecast of the peak and membership and the attrition rate. So here's what's in our guidance. We extended the public health emergency and the re-determination period out four months. We originally said that for every month it gets extended, it would produce about $150 million of revenue to our annual total. So that's the 600 million. If it gets extended to the end of the year, it's probably another $300 million, $400 million. Now, where is it peak and how far does it fall and where does it fall is very much unclear. I maintain that all of the membership that we grew since the pandemic started organically at its peak, it'll be 750,000 members 600,000 to the end of last year. 650,000 at the end of last year, another 60,000 in the first quarter, maybe another 40,000 in the second. So at its peak, we've added 750,000 Medicaid members organically and whether that's through the re-determination pause, struggling economies, it doesn't matter. That was the organic growth. How fast that trips and where does it bottom? Unclear. I maintain that a larger proportion of those members will fit because the low wage service economy has been ravaged. We all see the economy coming back. But if you look at the numbers, the low wage service economy, the sandwich shops, the restaurants, the drycleaner shops, aren't coming back real fast and I still think there will be a significant amount of that membership that will be on Medicaid for an extended period of time. So no, that wasn't a 22 forecast. But your supposition is correct. When we do give 2022 guidance later this year into next year we'll have to bring you from the peak of Medicaid membership this year to the trough next year. And that'll be a year-over-year comparison item.\nJustin Lake: So moving 2022. Joe just to be clear, like in the $4 are you assuming that that membership goes away or would it be current run rate plus $4 minus whatever happens with the Federal Emergency membership? That's 750,000.\nJoseph Zubretsky: What we're saying is no, we're not saying that what we're saying is this year with the membership we have, we're earning $13 a share. And inside of that number is a $1.50 overhang to the COVID. It has nothing to do with the membership it's just the direct costs of COVID related care, utilization suppression in the corridors. So the only thing that's in the 150 are those three items, those three items not included in that COVID impact is any impact from increased membership.\nJustin Lake: Okay. So we would have to subtract that just to be clear from the $4.\nJoseph Zubretsky: If that was the calculus that you were doing. Yes. But again, we were not giving 2022 forecast. We were giving a pro forma view of the embedded earnings power of the business as it exists today. It was not a forward forecast.\nJustin Lake: Got it. Alright, thanks for the color Joe.\nSpeaker: You are welcome Justin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes, Hi, good morning. Just wanted to go back your comment around the exchange strange in one of the things that you talk about was a strong product design. We thought it in Ohio, you embedded primary care business city blocks in the RFP. Just wanted to get some more color on your primary care strategy and how we think embedding it in other states?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Our network strategy and our marketplace is very traditional. We build the networks off of our Medicaid networks. In many cases they're slightly wider. Bear in mind that wider networks are always very attractive from a membership perspective but they carry a cost. But our marketplace network strategy is very traditional when it comes to hospitals, when it comes to specialty, services or primary care services. We are introducing in our Ohio RFP win a few new twists and turns with vendors partners that are going to help us deliver more community based care wrapping around primary care physicians to make them more effective. But I would say on balance our marketplace, network strategy is very traditional. We did introduce a couple of very innovative programs in our Ohio RFP. There's a company by the name of City block which has a very-very innovative approach to delivering care in the communities, in the home setting, reaching out into neighborhoods to find people that need care. This is a big problem in Medicaid. When people come into the hospital we'll get them the care we need. But finding them before the bad stuff happens is really a challenge. And I think this company, City block, which is a great partner is going to do a great job for us in the state of Ohio.\nRicky Goldwasser: And should we think about this as sort of a pilot, and if this is successful, it's something that you can expand into other states?\nJoseph Zubretsky: I would answer the question more generally that we are passionate about serving our state customers and I talk to and my team talks to the leaders of the Medicaid agencies, the governor's people in high administrative positions in government, always trying to understand what their most burning problems are, and whether it's social determinants of health, whether it's the opioid use, epidemic, racial disparities in healthcare. We are creating and providing innovative solutions to solve those problems, not only through our delivery of our Medicaid product but also in our $150 million commitment and what we call the Molina Cares Accord to put money back into the communities we serve. This is really important part of the relationship with the state customer, not only innovative programs that help drive down cost in the Medicaid program, but being committed to the communities that we serve. So yes it is a very common theme no matter where we go in our existing states or when we pitch a new state.\nRicky Goldwasser: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteve Valiquette: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So just for the public health emergency, you change your expectation for this to run through the end of 3Q, 21. Some of your MCR peers have a say in this around three year and seems HHS themselves have given some signals reported in the press that it also could run through year end. I am just curious if there's any political lead or some that suggest to you that maybe it's less likely to run through year end. Just any additional color on your thought pattern extension through 3Q versus something beyond that. Thanks.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Thanks for the question Steve. No, don't read any political insights into that. We just chose to extend it four months out to the end of September at $150 million per that $600 million of additional revenue. But no, we have no other insights. If it gets pushed out to the end of the year it's likely at a minimum $300 billion more in our 2021 premium revenue forecast. So no. No other insights except perhaps a measure of conservatism.\nSteve Valiquette: Okay, alright. That's perfect. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Joshua Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Joe, just want to clarify, I think you said no new corridor in New York. I think that was just for 2022. But I assume you've got the 2021 with the retro. And then are any states actually contemplating new corridors that are still kind of a little bit behind in the game that are trying to look back and figure that out and I guess the last part of the question would be why would a state eliminate it? What would the rationale be for a state to operate in the future if there's other issues, etc? What would be the rationale for saying hey, we don't need the corridors in place?\nJoseph Zubretsky: The answer to the first question you asked very specifically was yes, fully captured the retro corridor from April 22 back, but they did not introduce one for April 1, I am sorry April 21 but they did not introduce one for the 21/22 fiscal year. So that is correct. The white papers have been written on this. In the midst of a pandemic when you believe that a lot of the capitated rate is not going to get paid in services you come up with a construct as arbitrary as it is to recapture a portion of that rate. There are lots of ways to do that. We believe and many others believe that the risks sharing corridors even being symmetrical are not the appropriate way to do that. And here's the basic reason why. It actually penalizes an efficient operator, and promotes and rewards an inefficient operator. These things are symmetrical. If you had a 90% MLR target and you're beating it, you pay it, whether you beat it because a COVID or beat it just because you're better, you pay in. And if someone's operating at 92, they get a check. So it promotes in efficiency by not allowing efficient operators to hold on to the portion of the capitated rate, that they're truly driving through performance, knowing that whatever costs actually emerge, end up in rates eventually. If we keep driving down the cost of the program by being efficient, that ends up in the rate base on a lag basis. And that's why we should go back to and most people believe that the traditional rate setting process, setting a rate prospectively based on the observed trends in the business is the right way to go. Clearly, during the pandemic, they needed to do something quick, they got actuarial advice that supported this. But the momentum for these things is waning and the discussions that we're having with various of our state customers is suggesting that these things are going to disappear as the pandemic subsides.\nJoshua Raskin: That makes a ton of sense. So do you have alternatives? I mean, I understand the rate setting process is, the tradition rates processes is your preferred way. But clearly, in a pandemic, it's very difficult to parse out to your point what was COVID related versus what was company efficiencies or inefficiencies is there, have you provided data to the states that you feel comfortable that they actually know what the COVID impact was or is that kind of why they're using the blunt object of risk corridors?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Good question. It has been provided and of course, they have their own actuarial they use some of the largest firms in the country make household names that are recognizable to you. So they have their own actuarial resources. But yes, that's exactly the point and as trends come back to normal without these mini and micro inflections that happen across the country we believe and I believe the actuarial committee believes that will just revert back to the traditional rate setting process on a prospectively set basis. Eventually costs end up in race when costs are inflecting high they lag and managed care suffers and when trends are trending low and rates lag you went and you just work the ebbs and flows and the mini cycles of the business. That serve this business well for decades and decades and we believe that most Medicaid directors and most actuarial firms get that and are of the mind that as the pandemic subsides and disappears these constructs will disappear as well.\nJoshua Raskin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Borsch: Maybe I could just pick up on Joshua's question there. And the timing of the risk corridors rolling off? Is that actually going to be potentially a net negative to you at least relative to what you might have experienced that those risk corridors remained in place. What I'm really pointing to is the potential for above trend utilization in maybe the back half of this year or going into 2022 where the risk corridors would have served as something that was actually helpful to you. And so I guess what I'm wondering are they being pulled away exactly the wrong time?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Great question. Here's the way we think about them. First of all about sort of getting surprised by them or having an inordinate effect or an unanticipated effect they can no longer be retroactive. So the ones that are in place are in place. In order to be an active they have to be prospective in nature and they will coincide with the rate cycles. Most of our rates are one January one rates. We have a couple of default, Michigan, Texas. We have some July ones, Mississippi and South Carolina. So they will follow the rate cycle. So the quarters that we're now recording are the ones that have been inactive. You can't record a quarter that hasn't been inactive. Now if any one of these states that comes up for renewal inside the year enacts one, it could be an additional item for the year. But our feeling is that most of the states that come up this year it's either late in the year or they're smaller and it shouldn't have a big impact. The real wildcard and forecasting these is where you're under and over performance happens. There is very-very clearly that if you're in the money on a corridor, $1 of over performance goes against the corridor, very simple. But where's the dollar over underperformance going to occur? If it occurs in California that has no corridor we get to keep it. If that happens in Michigan, where we have a corridor we don't. And so when we said that the existence of these corridors adds an element of variability it's projecting where you're going to over and under performance that adds the element of variability. But right now we know where they are. They cannot be enacted retrospectively. They could be introduced for the 2022 fiscal year in a couple of states. We don't think that'll happen but it's possible. So we don't think there's a huge element of variability with respect to the introduction of the corridors but there is an element of forecast variability to where your under or over performance actually occurs.\nMatthew Borsch: That makes sense. Thank you, and then just follow up on it slightly different point. With the Medicare risk adjusters and the impact there it seems like it's having a larger basis point impact on your MCR in Medicare, if I compare that to some of you, or some of the other companies that, of course, have much larger books in Medicare. Is that some what the law of large numbers or law of small numbers that would account for the higher volatility?\nJoseph Zubretsky: Yes. We're very concentrated. A lot of this happens in our MMP book. Michigan, which had a very-very high infection rate, and we have a very robust Medicare business got hits specifically. So yes it's the law of large numbers. We're not nationwide. We're in a handful of places with material membership. I cited one but that's what it is. It's the randomness of where the infection is and where our membership is.\nMatthew Borsch: Got it. Thank you.\nJoseph Zubretsky: If I may operator, before the next question is asked because no questions were really asked on one of these lines. I did want to make a comment that doesn't respond to a question. But last night there was some very positive news that broke and I wanted to take this opportunity in a compliant format to mention it. Last night the Kentucky State Court issued an order which supported Molina's position as a Medicaid participant. They there was, as you know, some legal challenges to our award itself denied. There were legal challenges to our purchase of passport denied. There were legal challenges to the Novation of the passport contract to our business on September, 1 denied. What was upheld was the six plan model that the court stipulated many-many months ago. So as it stands today the ruling is that the Medicaid program continues on as is. We are operating in Kentucky under the passport brand. We have 326,000 members at the end of the quarter. We are performing really, really well and we're in good standing with the state. And the court has ruled as such. Now having said that the one stipulation that court didn't say was there was enough, I'm saying irregularity, but at least some aspects of the proposal process that perhaps weren't to their liking. And they asked for a re-procurement but didn't stipulate a date or time to that. So our point of view is, whenever that happens we'll be bidding on the contract but we'll be bidding as a strong incumbent. We've already won the contract twice. We will win it the third time and we're in great standing in the state. So positive news out of the Kentucky State Court last night. And just in case nobody asked the question that got to that issue I want to use this format to give you our position on that. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you all for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Mark Keim",
            "content": "Thank you Joe. And good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss some additional details on our first quarter performance, and then turn to our growth strategy balance sheet and some thoughts on our 2021 guidance. Beginning with some detailed commentary about our first quarter results there was virtually no incidence of the normal flu in the first quarter. Historically, a normal flu season would have resulted in $25 million to $40 million in medical costs in the first quarter. Severe winter weather resulted in unusually low utilization in many areas of the country in the month of February. While it's difficult to separate weather effects from other effects, there's no question it had an impact on the month. To the extent the types of services not utilized during the time are elective and discretionary, that utilization will likely begin to rebound. Much of the impact is timing. Well, the net effect of COVID wasn't aligned with our expectations and negligible to the quarter in total, the impacts were varied across our lines of business. We experienced higher direct cost of COVID related care in January, which then tapered off as the quarter progressed. We saw some pockets of non-COVID related utilization increases, but overall utilization was in line with expectations. In Medicaid, we generally experienced a modest utilization curtailment on inpatient and outpatient services. A significant portion of the resulting medical margin outperformance was recaptured by the COVID risk sharing corridors in several states. In contrast, our Medicare and marketplace businesses experienced disproportionately negative impacts due to an increase in direct cost of COVID related care in the quarter. The year-over-year MCR comparisons in these lines of businesses are less meaningful, as the current quarter includes these impacts from COVID and the first quarter of 2020 does not. In Medicare, the net effect of COVID increased the MCR by approximately 400 basis points in the quarter. In addition, the Medicare MCR was negatively impacted by the temporary challenge of risk scores that do not fully reflect the acuity of the membership. This is an industry wide issue that we mentioned when we gave our initial guidance. We're expecting COVID to dissipate through the year and anticipate four year Medicare MCRs in the high 80s. Marketplace experienced the high level of COVID cases early in the quarter which moderated throughout the quarter. Several of our markets were disproportionately impacted by COVID as a result of higher local infection rates. The COVID impacted marketplace increased the MCR by approximately 500 basis points in the quarter. With that said we expect the net effect of COVID to subside and continue to expect full year pre-tax margins in the mid single digit. I will now provide some commentary on our growth strategy beginning with M&A. Last week's announcement of our intent to acquire a Cigna Texas Medicaid and MMP business marks our fifth acquisition since our pivot to growth, ultimately reflecting the addition of 7 billion in annualized revenue. The Cigna transaction is expected to increase our Texas membership by 50,000, provide approximately a billion in annualized revenues, and drive accretion of at least $0.40 per diluted share in the first full year of ownership. This transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2021 and it's not included in our full year 2021 guidance. We now expect the Affinity transaction to close in the third quarter. Affinity is expected to increase our New York membership by approximately 300,000 provide approximately 1.5 billion in annualized revenue with the creation of $0.15 to $0.20 per diluted share in the first full year of ownership. The impact of the Affinity acquisition is also not included in our full year 2021 guidance. Acquisitions will continue to be a meaningful part of our growth strategy. While we are a scaled government sponsored managed care company, we are still at a size that our pipeline of smaller consolidation targets can have a meaningful impact on our growth rate. We see significant earnings growth from these acquired revenues. We have demonstrated our ability to fix underperforming businesses, have the discipline to harvest fixed cost leverage, and have every expectation of managing our acquisitions to margins that are reflective of our current portfolio performance. Our pipeline of M&A opportunities is robust. We continue to pursue bolt on acquisitions, single state plans, and provide our own plans. We will not pursue capability plates. We are at pure play premium risk bearing government sponsored managed care business, and we see significant growth opportunities within this space. Our strong cash flow makes the acquisition growth possible. At our current margins, we generate significant excess cash and additional debt capacity. Between cash on hand, near term cash flow, and additional debt capacity we currently have acquisition capacity of over 1.3 billion. At the multiples we have paid in recent transactions this gives us the current ability to drive well in excess of 3 billion in annualized revenue growth. And more importantly, at our current level of performance, this acquisition capacity is repeated and produced every single year. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and our reserve position remained strong. Days and claims payable at the end of the quarter represented 48 days of medical cost expense compared to 50 days in the fourth quarter, and 49 days in the first quarter of 2020. Prior year reserve development in the first quarter of 2021 was modestly favorable, but any P&L impact was absorbed by the COVID related risk corridors. Debt at the end of the quarter is 1.9 times trailing 12 month EBITDA. Our leverage ratio is 52%. However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash these ratios fall to 1.6 times and 47% respectively. Taken together, these metrics reflect a reasonably conservative leverage position. In the quarter, we repurchased an aggregate of approximately 577,000 shares for $122 million at an average price of approximately $211 per share. Our full year guidance continues to be based on 58.5 million shares. At the end of the quarter our parent company cash balance was 436 million. A few additional comments related to our earnings guidance. In raising our full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to be no less than $13 per share, the following assumptions are relevant. A higher proportion of medical margin performance will be absorbed by the risk sharing corridors over the remainder of the year. The net effect of COVID remains a net cost of approximately $1.50 per share for the full year and lastly we expect 55% to 60% of full year EPS to be produced in the first half of the year. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator. We are now ready to take questions."

            "name": "Joseph Zubretsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Julie and good morning. Today, we will provide you with updates on several topics. We will cover our financial results for the first quarter 2021. We will update our 2021 guidance in the context of our first quarter results and we will then provide an update on our growth initiatives and outlook for the future. Let me start with first quarter highlights. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of $4.44 with adjusted net income of $260 million and premium revenue of $6.3 billion. Our results for the quarter were strong across many dimensions. The 86.8% MCR demonstrates solid cost management fundamentals particularly in light of some of the challenges presented by the pandemic. We managed to a 7% adjusted G&A ratio as we continue to reinvest the benefits created by our strong enterprise wide fixed cost leverage in our growth initiatives. We produced an adjusted after tax margin of 4% squarely in line with our long term targets in exceeding our first quarter expectations. Our $4.44 adjusted earnings per share in the quarter were a 47% increase over the first quarter of 2020 and we accomplished all of this as we are generating 47% year-over-year premium revenue growth and successfully integrating businesses representing approximately $5 billion in annual revenue. In summary, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance as we executed well, delivered solid operating earnings, and continued to deliver on our growth strategy. Let me provide some commentary highlighting our first quarter performance. Premium revenue was $6.3 billion, a 47% increase over the first quarter of 2020 reflecting increased membership, in line with our expectations in both Medicaid and Medicare and exceeding our expectations in marketplace. We ended the quarter with 4.6 million managed care members, an increase of 573,000 over the fourth quarter 2020. Our Medicaid enrollment at the end of the quarter was 3.9 million members, an increase of 260,000 over the fourth quarter of 2020. This sequential increase was the result of strong organic growth of 63,000 members, as the suspension of redetermination in a slowly recovering economy continued to positively impact Medicaid membership. Although this growth catalyst seems to have moderated and growth of 197,000 members from the acquisition of Magellan Complete Care which closed on December 31. Our Medicare membership was 126,000 at the end of the quarter representing growth of 11,000 over the fourth quarter of 2020 which was primarily related to our acquisitions. Our marketplace membership grew by 302,000 in the quarter to 620,000, exceeding our initial forecast of at least 500,000 members. This growth was driven by several factors; strong product design and competitive pricing, effectuation rates substantially higher than historical averages, lower than expected natural attrition rates, and the extended open and special enrollment periods. Turning now to our medical margin results for the quarter. Our first quarter 2021 MCR was 86.8%, reflecting modest COVID related utilization curtailment, severe winter weather, and the absence of a traditional flu season offset by the direct costs of COVID related care. While the net effect of COVID for the total company was negligible in the quarter in line with our expectations, the impact varied by line of business. Our Medicare and marketplace businesses experienced a disproportionately negative impact from the net effect of COVID exerting pressure on their respective MCRs. This was offset by a modest favorable net COVID impact in Medicaid. Some additional comments on performance by line of business. In the Medicaid business, we achieved an 87.5% medical care ratio for the first quarter performing in line with our expectations. In addition to the external factors mentioned previously, which were unusually favorable in the quarter, the medical care ratio was also supported by our performance and utilization management and payment integrity. A portion of our Medicaid outperformance was recaptured by the risk sharing corridors and impact which was well within our expectations. The corridors are designed such that they will act as a buffer to absorb some of the over and underperformance related to medical margin no matter how that performance is derived. Our Medicare business produced a medical care ratio of 90.3% for the first quarter. The medical care ratio was negatively impacted by higher than expected direct costs of COVID related care and the temporary industry wide challenge of risk score capture, which results in risk scores that do not fully reflect the acuity of the membership. The Medicare business performed as expected when normalized for these two discrete impacts. Finally, our marketplace business experienced a medical care ratio of 77.3% for the first quarter. The medical care ratio was negatively impacted by higher than expected direct costs of COVID related care as the COVID infection rate resurged in many of our marketplace geographies. We did however, achieve our pre-tax earnings target due to the increased membership volume. We continue to effectively manage our resources. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7%, identical to the 7% reported in the first quarter of 2020. Our performance reflects disciplined cost management and the benefits of fixed costs leverage produced by our substantial growth offset somewhat by the higher than targeted DNA ratios of our acquired businesses which will improve as our integrations progress. We are pleased with our first quarter results as we continue to demonstrate the ability to produce excellent margins while substantially growing top line revenue and managing through the ongoing effects of the pandemic. Turning through our 2021 guidance, beginning with premium revenue. For 2021, we now project premium revenue to be more than $24 billion a 31% increase over the full year 2020 and a $1 billion increase from our previous guidance. Specifically, our premium revenue guidance now includes Medicaid enrollment benefiting from the expected extension of the public health emergency period, and the associated pause on membership redeterminations, which we are now projecting through the end of the third quarter. Recall, we had said that for each month public health emergency is extended beyond the month of May it could increase our full year revenue outlook by $150 million and updated marketplace revenue reflecting the strong enrollment and retention performance mentioned previously. We expect to end 2021 with slightly more than 500,000 marketplace members in marketplace premium revenue growth is now expected to be over 50%. We have excluded from our premium revenue guidance any impact of the affinity and signal acquisitions. We do expect these transactions to close this year representing upside to our premium revenue in 2021. In summary, we are very pleased with our growth trajectory. Our growth is well balanced between a new contract win, organic growth, bolt on acquisitions, benefit expansions in our existing geographies, and greater penetration of our marketplace in Medicare products in our Medicaid footprint. Turning now to earnings guidance. We are raising our full year 2021 adjusted earnings guidance to be no less than $13 per share, an increase from our prior guidance of $12.50 to $13 per share. Specifically, the increase towards 2021 earnings guidance reflects the favorable impacts of the increase in our revenue guidance and the associated margin, the first quarter earnings outperformance, and the combined effect of other individually minor impacts such as the sequestration delay in Medicare. We have however, hedged our guidance due to a variety of exogenous factors. First and foremost, we are still in a pandemic which introduces a level of uncertainty with respect to any healthcare utilization forecast. We have continued to be cautious in forecasting utilization trends in the remaining nine months of the year as the COVID pandemic subsides. How quickly and to what extent utilization rebound will depend upon the strength of the economy, consumer behavior, provider capacity and the level of COVID infection rates. With respect to forecasting, our marketplace utilization trends we recognize there is an inherent level of uncertainty with regard to new member acuity levels which we will monitor closely and the risk sharing corners create an added element of variability. While any individual stake corridor can be a buffer to that state over or underperformance predicting in which states over or underperformance may occur can create an element of forecasting variability. Turning now to an update on our growth initiatives. We are very pleased to have been rewarded our major Medicaid contracts in the state of Ohio. We were awarded contracts in all three regions in the state maintaining our statewide presence. This re-procurement win is a testimony to our excellent service, innovative programs, strong relationships, and our reputation as a business partner that can be counted on. While Ohio did introduce at least one additional player to the statewide program, continuity of care is of the utmost importance to a Medicaid program. As such, we have every reason to believe our current business profile should not materially change. The agreement to acquire Cigna STAR+PLUS membership is yet another example of an accretive, strategic bolt on acquisition. The business serves approximately 50,000 ADB and MMP members across three regions in Texas. Full year 2020 revenue is approximately $1 billion. With a modest purchase price of $60 million, we project the acquisition will deliver returns well in excess of our cost of capital, benefit from local and enterprise operating leverage and will be immediately accretive. The expanded presence in Texas should position us well and the re-procurement should the state proceed with that process. Finally, some comments about the longer term outlook for our business. The current rate environment is stable and rational. We continue to believe that the Medicaid risk sharing corridors that were previously introduced are related to the declared public health emergency and will be eliminated as the COVID pandemic subsides. We continue to be bullish about the performance of our acquired businesses. The operational integrations are proceeding as or better than planned, and we have high confidence in achieving our original accretion estimates and possibly even exceeding them. In the context of the pandemic subsiding and our acquisitions maturing, the embedded earnings power of the business, as it exists today is at least $4 higher than our adjusted earnings per share guidance. The emergence of embedded earnings combined with our future growth creates a very attractive earnings growth outlook. Our first quarter performance demonstrates that our growth plan is working well. We have built sound operational infrastructure, which allows us to operationally execute and maintain these attractive margins. We have reinvigorated our platforms to drive organic membership growth. We have built winning RFP and M&A capabilities that have catalyzed our growth and accessing new opportunities and we continue to focus on capital allocation and free cash flow generation to create shareholder value. The political, legislative, and regulatory trends are positive for the businesses we are in and our management team is well established, disciplined, and laser focused on our mission to serve members and shareholders. I look forward to sharing more about our future growth plans and longer term strategy at our investor day in September. As I conclude my remarks, I want to express my gratitude to our management team and our nearly 13,000 Molina colleagues. Their skill, dedication and steadfast service formed the foundation for everything we have achieved and everything we will achieve in the years to come. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Keim for some additional color on the financials. Let me summarize what is in our guidance Kevin, this is Joe. When we guided to no less than $13 this year, we are including an additional margin on $600 million of Medicaid revenue due to the extension of the re-determination clause. We're also including a margin on the additional $400 million of marketplace revenue due to the increased membership. We are then hedging our forecast due to the uncertainty related to utilization in the last nine months of the year. So very clearly increasing our guidance to no less than $13 a share. What we have said when we gave our original guidance and continued to say is that the net cost of COVID inside that forecast is $1.50 a share. And if you recall the way we measure the COVID impact is any impact of curtailment or suppression of utilization offset by the direct costs of COVID related care absorbed then by the risk sharing corridors. We continue to believe that will cost our earnings $1.50 a share. So if you look at the impact of COVID as being an overhang of $1.50, the disruption to Medicare rescoring costing about another dollar per share, and then extend our acquisitions to their full state of maturity we say the embedded earnings power of the business currently is $4 higher than our current year guidance. And to be clear of that $4, that's not a 2022 guidance number outlook. That is, as we sit here today, there are certain overhangs on the earnings, projection of the business that are causing our earnings to be lower this year than they otherwise would be when our acquisitions mature, and when COVID disappears. Obviously there will be a lot more puts and takes into next year. And when we give our outlook in September our investor day will give you a better look of what 2022 looks like. Obviously, the re-determination clause increasing revenue this year where does it peak, how far does it fall, how quickly does it a trip is going to be a major item in a year-over-year comparison. But with 47% revenue of premium revenue growth this year, we're not at all that concerned with the upticks of 2022 versus 2021 at this point. So anytime you take on new membership by its very nature, inherently, you don't yet understand the acuity of that population. I mean, you start with an assumption that if somebody buys insurance, they generally need it. But our bronze-silver mix is about what we forecasted for the year. We have improved dramatically in attaining risk scores. We've improved that operation from last year, we recall it was a performance glitch last year, we've improved on it. All I can say at this point is we know we've improved and attunity risk scores compared to ourselves. Obviously, we don't have the industry data yet to compare how we're doing to our competitors, which will ultimately decide what risk scores we've attained. But we are doing better compared to ourselves, we'll be able to give a much clearer forecast on utilization trends, generally marketplace, Medicaid and Medicare, when we report our second quarter, but at this time, it's very prudent just to remain cautious, given the effects of the pandemic as it is still in full throes here in the first quarter is divides into the second and third. So I mean, Robert, we tried to be clear on this. We're not implying or merely suggesting we're being conservative. We're declaring we're being conservative. As we work through the quarter-over-quarter effects of the pandemic starting all the way back in the second quarter of last year the mini and micro inflections up and down that occur are very geographically dispersed very much tied to local infection rates, very much tied now to the improvement in the acuity to population to the vaccination rate and opening up of economies. And it is the variation in modeling utilization for the balance of the other variation in the various models is so wide, that we believe it's prudent just to be very cautious on how fast utilization will rebound, when does it rebound to pre-COVID Levels, does it rebound fully to pre-COVID levels, where and when and how is very much a variant at this point and it just is very prudent to remain cautious on utilization for the balance of the year. No, that's still a good number. The disruption and risk scoring cost about 300 basis points in our Medicare MCR for the quarter. If you can do the math on that, that's still pretty much the dollar for the year. Yes. The competitive landscape hasn't changed all that much. Yes some of the new entrants came into some of our markets, and started to build market share in those markets. But we're a very niche business. We do not serve affluent suburban. We serve the working poor. We've always said we built our marketplace networks off of our Medicaid networks, we priced them off our Medicaid networks and we're seeking out fully and highly subsidized members that are on government assistance. This is clearly an extension of our Medicaid strategy servicing the working for you. We like the position we're in not only are we improving our performance and growing, but it's not right size in the portfolio. Early on as we started this journey three years ago, there was no question that the marketplace earnings were outsized in relation to the portfolio. Now with marketplace revenues, representing about 10% of the total margins, mid single digit. So the earnings about 10% of the total as well. It's positioned nicely in the portfolio, strategically leverages our Medicaid infrastructure and is now a very good complement, financially and operationally good complement to our Medicaid business. Sure A.J. When we gave initial guidance, we never actually parsed to the components curtailment, direct cost of COVID care or the corridors. We said that the components are highly variable but the fact that the corridors do exist they do act as a buffer that we were very comfortable in the projection that COVID in total net would be a drag on earnings of $1.50 per share and we continue to say that. We never actually gave a specific quarter or a number. And you really shouldn't put the quarter numbers going to flex up and down with curtailment in the direct costs of COVID related to care, that's how they work. So to me, it's really the net number that's really important. Obviously, if the component parts get materially different, maybe we report on that, but right now, saying it's going to cost us $1.50 a share is the best metric to hang on. With respect to your second question, yes there's positive momentum that not only suggests but is concluding that the risk sharing corridors were related to the public health emergency. They were fully intended to recapture the portion of the capitated rate that was never paid out on benefits due to the pandemic and there is growing momentum with many of our state customers, the actuarial community, the public policy funded etc, that these will disappear as the COVID pandemic subsides. In fact, New York did not introduce a risk sharing corridor for its 22 fiscal year, which started on April 1 and California publicly declared that it is not introducing a corridor for its 22 fiscal year, which starts on January 1 of 2022, and there's lots of good momentum legislatively, administratively in many other states that are suggesting that these were related to the public health emergency and will begin to fall away as the pandemic subsides. Obviously, as that happens, as they become enacted or not enacted, we see draft rates will report as we report our quarters. Hi Scott. On the price like willing buyer willing seller, and that's the price we agreed to and without an allocation of capital 6% of revenue is clearly attractive. Now it's all about the Texas re-procurement and how this positions us in that re-procurement. So bolting on a billion dollars of revenue to our Texas Medicaid business, which is $2 billion strong right now increasing it by 50% adding two new regions where we're not present overlap and third is very-very attractive to our statewide presence. The business is profitable, marginally profitable but again, we bring Texas scale, we bring a lot more infrastructure, and we're going to leverage the daylights out of our fixed cost structure in the state of Texas we will be able to improve the margins due to our existing presence. So attractively priced, will recover the purchase price with the two first years of cash flow making it a free option upon re-procurement. You're actually captured it perfectly. Our MCR will likely be in the mid to high 70s, where previously was in mid to low 70s. But we're getting to G&A leverage. Our G&A ratio is improving by 200 to 300 basis points, which, again, clearly puts us in the mid single digit pre-tax category. Now, there's a range around what pre-tax, single digit pre-tax means. But we have every reason to believe that given what we experienced in the first quarter, if the pandemic does subside, we get appropriate risk scores on the new membership that will achieve mid single digit margins even on the increased size of the business. Anytime you grow a business it puts pressure on margins but we're still committed to in forecasting that will be at mid single digits pre-tax even on the increased revenue. Morning. The first answer to the very specific question you asked is no. That was an embedded earnings were wasn't a 2022 forecasts. It wasn't a bridge to 2022. It was, when these three or four factors disappear the earnings power of our business, the embedded earnings power is $4 higher. It was not a projection. It was certainly not a forecast of the peak and membership and the attrition rate. So here's what's in our guidance. We extended the public health emergency and the re-determination period out four months. We originally said that for every month it gets extended, it would produce about $150 million of revenue to our annual total. So that's the 600 million. If it gets extended to the end of the year, it's probably another $300 million, $400 million. Now, where is it peak and how far does it fall and where does it fall is very much unclear. I maintain that all of the membership that we grew since the pandemic started organically at its peak, it'll be 750,000 members 600,000 to the end of last year. 650,000 at the end of last year, another 60,000 in the first quarter, maybe another 40,000 in the second. So at its peak, we've added 750,000 Medicaid members organically and whether that's through the re-determination pause, struggling economies, it doesn't matter. That was the organic growth. How fast that trips and where does it bottom? Unclear. I maintain that a larger proportion of those members will fit because the low wage service economy has been ravaged. We all see the economy coming back. But if you look at the numbers, the low wage service economy, the sandwich shops, the restaurants, the drycleaner shops, aren't coming back real fast and I still think there will be a significant amount of that membership that will be on Medicaid for an extended period of time. So no, that wasn't a 22 forecast. But your supposition is correct. When we do give 2022 guidance later this year into next year we'll have to bring you from the peak of Medicaid membership this year to the trough next year. And that'll be a year-over-year comparison item. What we're saying is no, we're not saying that what we're saying is this year with the membership we have, we're earning $13 a share. And inside of that number is a $1.50 overhang to the COVID. It has nothing to do with the membership it's just the direct costs of COVID related care, utilization suppression in the corridors. So the only thing that's in the 150 are those three items, those three items not included in that COVID impact is any impact from increased membership. If that was the calculus that you were doing. Yes. But again, we were not giving 2022 forecast. We were giving a pro forma view of the embedded earnings power of the business as it exists today. It was not a forward forecast. Our network strategy and our marketplace is very traditional. We build the networks off of our Medicaid networks. In many cases they're slightly wider. Bear in mind that wider networks are always very attractive from a membership perspective but they carry a cost. But our marketplace network strategy is very traditional when it comes to hospitals, when it comes to specialty, services or primary care services. We are introducing in our Ohio RFP win a few new twists and turns with vendors partners that are going to help us deliver more community based care wrapping around primary care physicians to make them more effective. But I would say on balance our marketplace, network strategy is very traditional. We did introduce a couple of very innovative programs in our Ohio RFP. There's a company by the name of City block which has a very-very innovative approach to delivering care in the communities, in the home setting, reaching out into neighborhoods to find people that need care. This is a big problem in Medicaid. When people come into the hospital we'll get them the care we need. But finding them before the bad stuff happens is really a challenge. And I think this company, City block, which is a great partner is going to do a great job for us in the state of Ohio. I would answer the question more generally that we are passionate about serving our state customers and I talk to and my team talks to the leaders of the Medicaid agencies, the governor's people in high administrative positions in government, always trying to understand what their most burning problems are, and whether it's social determinants of health, whether it's the opioid use, epidemic, racial disparities in healthcare. We are creating and providing innovative solutions to solve those problems, not only through our delivery of our Medicaid product but also in our $150 million commitment and what we call the Molina Cares Accord to put money back into the communities we serve. This is really important part of the relationship with the state customer, not only innovative programs that help drive down cost in the Medicaid program, but being committed to the communities that we serve. So yes it is a very common theme no matter where we go in our existing states or when we pitch a new state. Thanks for the question Steve. No, don't read any political insights into that. We just chose to extend it four months out to the end of September at $150 million per that $600 million of additional revenue. But no, we have no other insights. If it gets pushed out to the end of the year it's likely at a minimum $300 billion more in our 2021 premium revenue forecast. So no. No other insights except perhaps a measure of conservatism. The answer to the first question you asked very specifically was yes, fully captured the retro corridor from April 22 back, but they did not introduce one for April 1, I am sorry April 21 but they did not introduce one for the 21/22 fiscal year. So that is correct. The white papers have been written on this. In the midst of a pandemic when you believe that a lot of the capitated rate is not going to get paid in services you come up with a construct as arbitrary as it is to recapture a portion of that rate. There are lots of ways to do that. We believe and many others believe that the risks sharing corridors even being symmetrical are not the appropriate way to do that. And here's the basic reason why. It actually penalizes an efficient operator, and promotes and rewards an inefficient operator. These things are symmetrical. If you had a 90% MLR target and you're beating it, you pay it, whether you beat it because a COVID or beat it just because you're better, you pay in. And if someone's operating at 92, they get a check. So it promotes in efficiency by not allowing efficient operators to hold on to the portion of the capitated rate, that they're truly driving through performance, knowing that whatever costs actually emerge, end up in rates eventually. If we keep driving down the cost of the program by being efficient, that ends up in the rate base on a lag basis. And that's why we should go back to and most people believe that the traditional rate setting process, setting a rate prospectively based on the observed trends in the business is the right way to go. Clearly, during the pandemic, they needed to do something quick, they got actuarial advice that supported this. But the momentum for these things is waning and the discussions that we're having with various of our state customers is suggesting that these things are going to disappear as the pandemic subsides. Good question. It has been provided and of course, they have their own actuarial they use some of the largest firms in the country make household names that are recognizable to you. So they have their own actuarial resources. But yes, that's exactly the point and as trends come back to normal without these mini and micro inflections that happen across the country we believe and I believe the actuarial committee believes that will just revert back to the traditional rate setting process on a prospectively set basis. Eventually costs end up in race when costs are inflecting high they lag and managed care suffers and when trends are trending low and rates lag you went and you just work the ebbs and flows and the mini cycles of the business. That serve this business well for decades and decades and we believe that most Medicaid directors and most actuarial firms get that and are of the mind that as the pandemic subsides and disappears these constructs will disappear as well. Great question. Here's the way we think about them. First of all about sort of getting surprised by them or having an inordinate effect or an unanticipated effect they can no longer be retroactive. So the ones that are in place are in place. In order to be an active they have to be prospective in nature and they will coincide with the rate cycles. Most of our rates are one January one rates. We have a couple of default, Michigan, Texas. We have some July ones, Mississippi and South Carolina. So they will follow the rate cycle. So the quarters that we're now recording are the ones that have been inactive. You can't record a quarter that hasn't been inactive. Now if any one of these states that comes up for renewal inside the year enacts one, it could be an additional item for the year. But our feeling is that most of the states that come up this year it's either late in the year or they're smaller and it shouldn't have a big impact. The real wildcard and forecasting these is where you're under and over performance happens. There is very-very clearly that if you're in the money on a corridor, $1 of over performance goes against the corridor, very simple. But where's the dollar over underperformance going to occur? If it occurs in California that has no corridor we get to keep it. If that happens in Michigan, where we have a corridor we don't. And so when we said that the existence of these corridors adds an element of variability it's projecting where you're going to over and under performance that adds the element of variability. But right now we know where they are. They cannot be enacted retrospectively. They could be introduced for the 2022 fiscal year in a couple of states. We don't think that'll happen but it's possible. So we don't think there's a huge element of variability with respect to the introduction of the corridors but there is an element of forecast variability to where your under or over performance actually occurs. Yes. We're very concentrated. A lot of this happens in our MMP book. Michigan, which had a very-very high infection rate, and we have a very robust Medicare business got hits specifically. So yes it's the law of large numbers. We're not nationwide. We're in a handful of places with material membership. I cited one but that's what it is. It's the randomness of where the infection is and where our membership is. If I may operator, before the next question is asked because no questions were really asked on one of these lines. I did want to make a comment that doesn't respond to a question. But last night there was some very positive news that broke and I wanted to take this opportunity in a compliant format to mention it. Last night the Kentucky State Court issued an order which supported Molina's position as a Medicaid participant. They there was, as you know, some legal challenges to our award itself denied. There were legal challenges to our purchase of passport denied. There were legal challenges to the Novation of the passport contract to our business on September, 1 denied. What was upheld was the six plan model that the court stipulated many-many months ago. So as it stands today the ruling is that the Medicaid program continues on as is. We are operating in Kentucky under the passport brand. We have 326,000 members at the end of the quarter. We are performing really, really well and we're in good standing with the state. And the court has ruled as such. Now having said that the one stipulation that court didn't say was there was enough, I'm saying irregularity, but at least some aspects of the proposal process that perhaps weren't to their liking. And they asked for a re-procurement but didn't stipulate a date or time to that. So our point of view is, whenever that happens we'll be bidding on the contract but we'll be bidding as a strong incumbent. We've already won the contract twice. We will win it the third time and we're in great standing in the state. So positive news out of the Kentucky State Court last night. And just in case nobody asked the question that got to that issue I want to use this format to give you our position on that. Thank you."

After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?\nJoe Zubretsky: Thank you, Joe, and good morning. Today, we will provide updates on several topics. Our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, our initial 2023 revenue and earnings guidance, our growth initiatives and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth, and our outlook on premium revenue for 2024, given our new business successes in 2022. Let me start with the fourth quarter highlights. Last night, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.10, representing 42% growth year-over-year. Our fourth quarter 88.3% consolidated medical care ratio, 7.5% adjusted G&A ratio, and 3.9% adjusted pretax margin demonstrate continued strong operating performance. The fourth quarter completes another strong year of operating and financial performance. For the full year, we grew premium revenue by 15% to approximately $31 billion and grew adjusted earnings per share by 32% to $17.92. Our full year adjusted pretax margin of 4.4% was squarely in line with our long-term targets. Medicaid, our flagship business representing approximately 80% of enterprise revenue continues to produce very strong and predictable operating results and cash flows. For the year, we grew membership by approximately 10% and premium revenue by 21%, driven by the inception of our Nevada Medicaid contract, recently closed acquisitions and organic growth. The rate environment is stable and we are executing on the fundamentals of medical cost management. The full year reported MCR of 88% is at the low end of our long term target range and consistent with pre-pandemic levels, reflecting the underlying strength of our diversified portfolio and our focused execution. Our high acuity Medicare niche serving low income members representing 12% of enterprise revenue, continues to grow organically and demonstrate strong operating performance. For the year, we grew membership by 10% and premium revenue by 13%. Membership growth was driven primarily by our low income MAPD product, which more than doubled in 2022. The full year reported MCR of 88.5% was modestly above our long term target range, but includes approximately 300 basis points of pressure from COVID-related care. In Marketplace, the smallest of our three lines of business, we repositioned the business both in terms of its size in the portfolio and metallic mix. On a pure period basis, the business performed at roughly breakeven. While the financial performance did not meet our initial expectations for the year, we believe we have positioned our marketplace business to achieve target margins in 2023. Turning now to the execution of our growth strategy for the year. The successes in 2022 were many. On the M&A front, we closed on the acquisition of Cigna's Texas Medicaid business at the beginning of the year. And the AgeWell acquisition, at the beginning of the fourth quarter. In July, we announced the My Choice Wisconsin acquisition further adding to our market leading LTSS franchise. Our performance on Medicaid RFPs in the year was exceptional. We renewed our contract in Mississippi, doubled the size of our California contract for 2024 and won two new contracts: first in Iowa and then Nebraska for a 100% win rate on RFP responses submitted. In total, we project that these RFP wins for the year will add $4.4 billion in run rate premium revenue. In summary, our full year 2022 enterprise results continue to demonstrate our ability to produce excellent margins, while expanding our franchise by growing premium revenues. Turning now to our 2023 guidance. You can easily see the results of the repeatable earnings pattern we have created. We built new store contract backlog and harvest the earnings as the contracts and acquisitions mature. Meanwhile, we continue to focus on the operating fundamentals and drive operational improvements, which allows us to grow the core business at attractive margins. With regard to our 2023 guidance, we project 2023 premium revenue of $32 billion, representing a 19% compound annual growth rate since our pivot to growth in 2019. The 2022 earnings per share of $17.92 serves as a solid high margin earnings jump-off point. We expect that $1 per share of prior embedded earnings will emerge into 2023 earnings. We expect to produce $1.50 per share of core growth and operational improvements. We expect all of these elements will combine to produce 2023 core earnings per share of at least $20.40, offset by $0.65 per share of one-time contract implementation costs, which results in our 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $19.75. The operating improvements supporting the margins in our guidance are durable. The various elements which could impact earnings, COVID, flu, RSV, any margin impacts from redeterminations have been considered informing our guidance. The metrics implied by guidance are squarely in line with our long-term target ranges. As our guidance produces a 4.7% pretax margin, with a growth rate of 14% in core earnings and 10% on a reported adjusted basis. This is an attractive growth profile in a model that is repeatable. In addition to the growth within our guidance, we continue to build an earnings base for the future in the form of our embedded earnings profile, which provides a forward view of our earnings potential beyond 2023. The new store component of our embedded earnings defined as earnings from achieving target margins on acquisitions and new Medicaid contract wins is now at least $4 per share. The ongoing net effect of COVID, which at this point is the continuing earnings impact from the three remaining risk corridors, adds $2 per share of additional upside to this figure. This latent earnings growth estimate does not take into consideration any future organic growth or future strategic initiatives. Turning now to our growth strategy. We have taken major strides toward our $42 billion 2025 premium goal. At this early stage, we already have a clear line of sight to $35.5 billion in 2024. The key to our strategy is balanced, a stellar record of new contract wins, Kentucky, Nevada and now filling in the middle part of the country. The doubling of the size of our California business, including significant expansion in Los Angeles County, preserving and securing all of our incumbent state contracts and no large reprocurements in the near-term, continuing to build the M&A pipeline as this aspect of our strategy has already produced seven transactions for $10 billion. in revenue. Not to mention, organic growth, one member at a time by focusing on greater member attraction and retention and overcoming the regulatory headwinds of redeterminations and pharmacy carve outs. With that as the backdrop, I will now provide an update on some specific in flight opportunities related to our long term growth strategy. At the end of January, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission posted a notice on its website indicating that it was issuing a notice of intent to award our Texas Health Plan, a contract for all of our existing eight service areas in the state. We expect to be able to provide more of an update once these contracts have been finalized and signed. Our RFP response for the Indiana LTSS program has been submitted, it is pending evaluation and subsequent award announcement. In New Mexico, the state announced it has terminated the RFP that was in process and according to their press release, intends to issue an expedited reprocurement as soon as possible. We have many other new state business development initiatives well underway, including the potential for expanding to our former nearly statewide footprint in Florida. Our growing Medicaid footprint still only represents half of the 41 states with managed Medicaid. With multiple new state RFP opportunities over the coming years, and our demonstrated capabilities, referenceability and track record, we remain confident in our ability to win additional new state contracts. Our acquisition pipeline remains replete with actionable opportunities. While the timing of transactions remains difficult to predict, the strength of our pipeline and our track record of success gives us confidence in our ability to drive further growth from this important element of our growth strategy. In summary, we are very pleased with our business performance and the progress made in 2022 on our growth strategy, which has created a solid and growing financial profile. At least $20.40 of core earnings per share and $19.75 per share of adjusted earnings in 2023. Current new store embedded earnings power of at least $4 per share with an additional $2 of upside, if and when the few remaining COVID era corridors are eliminated. And $35.5 billion of identified premium revenue in 2024. All of this is before any impact from the continued execution of our growth initiatives. Of course, we could not accomplish all of this without our excellent management team and dedicated associates now approaching 15,000 strong, who in concert with our hallmark, proprietary operating model and management process have produced these results. To the entire team, I once again extend my deepest thanks in heartfelt appreciation. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional insight on the financials. Mark?\nMark Keim: Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss some additional details on our fourth quarter and full year performance, our strong balance sheet and our 2023 guidance. Beginning with our fourth quarter and full year results, our consolidated MCR for the fourth quarter was 88.3%, reflecting continued strong medical cost management. For the quarter, flu, RSV and COVID-related medical costs in total were largely in line with our expectations, but the impact varied by line of business, with Medicare being disproportionately impacted. Our full year consolidated MCR was 88%. This result was consistent with our expectations and was driven by the continued strong performance of our flagship Medicaid business. In Medicaid, our fourth quarter reported MCR was 87.3%. This strong performance was driven by effective medical cost management, and favorable retroactive premiums. The net effect of COVID in the quarter was a modest 30 basis points within our reported MCR. Our full year Medicaid MCR of 88% was at the low end of our long term target range and consistent with pre-pandemic levels. In Medicare, our fourth quarter reported MCR of 91.8% was driven by higher COVID, flu and the mix effect of our significant growth in MAPD. During the quarter, the net effect of COVID was 300 basis points within our reported MCR. Our full year Medicare MCR was 88.5% modestly above our long term target range and was similarly burdened by 300 basis points of net effect of COVID. In marketplace, our reported fourth quarter MCR was 93.8%. The MCR was impacted by normal seasonality and increased utilization in a handful of markets. The net effect of COVID was approximately 50 basis points within our reported MCR. In the quarter, we also settled some provider balances dating to prior years, which disproportionately impacted our Marketplace MCR by approximately 300 basis points. Our full year Marketplace MCR of 87.2% exceeded our long-term target range and includes approximately 120 basis points of net effective COVID, as well as approximately 130 basis points from the impact of a 2021 risk adjustment true-up recorded in the second quarter. Additional drivers of our strong fourth quarter and full year results include a 7.5% fourth quarter adjusted G&A ratio, which was in line with expected seasonal expenditures related to open enrollment and spending on community and charitable activities. Our full year adjusted G&A ratio improved year-over-year to 7.1% as we remain focused on delivering fixed cost leverage as we grow, even while making the appropriate investments to sustain our growth. Fourth quarter and full year results also feature higher net investment income as expected from recent increases in interest rates. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and we continue to be confident in our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 47%, about three days lower sequentially. The decline was driven by the increased mix of LTSS claims, which settled more quickly, resulting from the closing of the AgeWell acquisition as well as an additional payment cycle in the quarter. Our capital foundation remains strong. Debt at the end of the quarter was 1.8 times trailing 12-month EBITDA, and our debt-to-total cap ratio was 44.9. On a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.5 times and 40.7%, respectively. Our leverage remains low. All bond maturities are long dated on average eight years and our weighted average cost of debt fixed at just 4%. In the quarter, we harvested $268 million of subsidiary dividends and repurchased approximately 590,000 of our shares. Parent company cash at the end of the quarter was $375 million. With substantial incremental debt capacity, cash on hand and strong cash flow to the parent, we have ample dry powder to drive our organic and inorganic growth strategies. 2022 full year operating cash flow was lower compared to the prior year, primarily due to the cash settlement in 2022 of large prior year marketplace risk adjustment and Medicaid risk corridor payments. Normalizing for the timing of these payments, 2022 operating cash flow was $1.6 billion. Turning now to our 2023 guidance, beginning with membership. In Medicaid, we expect organic growth, the midyear inception of the Iowa contract and membership from our My Choice Wisconsin acquisition to be largely offset by the second quarter resumption of redeterminations. We expect this to result in 2023 year-end membership of approximately 4.7 million members. In Medicare, based on our performance in the annual enrollment period, we expect to begin the year with 160,000 members and continue to grow during the year, ending 2023 with total membership of approximately 175,000 members. Our Medicare membership growth for 2023 is expected to be evenly split between our D-SNP and MAPD products. In Marketplace, based on open enrollment, we expect to begin 2023 with approximately 290,000 members, reflecting our pricing strategy to achieve target margins in this business for 2023. Accounting for a limited SEP and normal levels of attrition through the year. We expect to end 2023 with approximately 230,000 members. We continue to treat any marketplace membership from Medicaid redeterminations as upside to these projections. Moving on to premium revenue. Our 2023 premium revenue guidance is $32 billion, representing 4% growth from 2022 Our revenue guidance is comprised of several items, $1.2 billion for the full year impact of AgeWell and expected revenue from the My Choice Wisconsin acquisition when closed. $1 billion of organic growth in Medicaid and Medicare and $900 million for the midyear inception of our new Iowa contract. Several offsetting items include: $600 million for the known pharmacy carve-outs, $500 million for the impact of the resumption of redeterminations beginning in April, $600 million for the lower Marketplace membership, and $300 million in 2022 pass-through revenue that we don't expect to recur in 2023. Turning to earnings guidance. We expect full year adjusted earnings to be at least $19.75 per share. Our EPS guidance reflects the realization of approximately $1 per share of 2022 embedded earnings, consisting of the contribution from acquisitions and a portion of the net effect of COVID partially offset by the impact of redeterminations. To this, we add $1.50 for the underlying organic growth plus several operating levers, including our real estate reduction strategy, the full year effect of our PBM contract and net investment income, partially offset by the negative impact of known pharmacy carve-outs. These drivers combined to deliver core earnings per share of at least $20.40. Recognizing the one-time non-recurring implementation costs in 2023 for our new contract wins that we now project to be $0.65 per share, yields our 2023 earnings per share guidance of at least $19.75. Moving on to select P&L guidance metrics. We expect our consolidated medical care ratio to be approximately 88%, consistent with our 2022 results. We expect our adjusted G&A ratio to fall slightly to 7%, even while absorbing the impact of the one-time non-recurring implementation costs for our new contract wins. This reflects disciplined cost management and fixed cost leverage from our revenue growth. Excluding the new contract implementation costs, our adjusted G&A ratio would have improved year-over-year to 6.8%. The effective tax rate is expected to be 25.3%, adjusted after-tax margin is expected to be 3.5%, well within our long-term target range. Weighted average share count is expected to be 58.1 million shares. And we expect our quarterly adjusted earnings per share profile to be fairly flat over the year, with the first two quarters of the year at roughly $5 each. As Joe mentioned, our 2023 new store embedded earnings power is at least $4 per share and is comprised of at least $3.50 from our three recent new contract wins, and $0.50 per share for AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin acquisitions, achieving full accretion. We continue to carry approximately $2 for COVID era risk corridors providing additional potential upside to be at least $4 of new store growth embedded earnings. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for some concluding remarks. Joe?\nJoe Zubretsky: Thanks, Mark. In looking back over the past five years, we pause briefly to reflect on our company's accomplishments. We won $5 billion in new Medicaid awards over the period and defended all of our existing contracts. We acquired $10 billion in profitable revenue. In short, we doubled the revenue base. We have produced industry-leading margins in our core products, averaging 4% to 5% on a pretax basis. The top line growth and margin expansion allowed us to grow earnings per share from a loss in 2017 to nearly $20 per share in 2023 guidance. We've ascended to Fortune 125 status and were promoted into the S&P 500. We have a pure-play government managed care franchise to grow and build on. We only take this retrospective journey to express our excitement, enthusiasm and energy for the next five years. There are so many more opportunities to continue to grow and expand our franchise. As we say here at the company, reaching milestones is not a cost for celebration, but a cause for consternation as reaching one merely marks the point in time to set new aspirational goals. We plan to share our view over the next five years with you at an Investor Day later this year. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. So the guidance for the 2023 MLR is overall flat. I assume it would be fair to expect the Marketplace MLR to be down meaningfully. But even just based on size, probably not a meaning contributor. Would it be fair to assume that the Medicaid MLR embedded in there is actually up? And maybe you could help quantify some of those absolute changes by segment and maybe specifically how reterminations are impacting your view of the Medicaid MLR?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, Josh. That is correct. We are going to produce a consolidated medical care ratio of 88% in each of 2022 and our guidance through 2023. We get there in a slightly different way year-over-year. Obviously, with our repositioning of the Marketplace business, we're projecting that with pricing actions, with the small silver and stable strategy, we will bring that MCR down within the long-term range at the high end of the long-term range of 78% to 80%. Medicare slightly underperformed our long-term target for the year because of 300 basis points of pressure. We now project that Medicare will come into its long-term target range, perhaps in the middle of that range. And yes, because we have been outperforming our long-term guidance range in Medicaid, 80% of our revenue, we are forecasting a reversion to the mean, considering all the impacts of flu, RSV, COVID, any potential nuanced reaction to retermination process puts us in the middle of the range at 88.5%, our long-term range being 88% to 89%. So that's the line of business tail of the tape for MCR projection into 2023.\nMark Keim: That's right, Joe. Josh, it's Mark. Total guidance at 88% MLR. As Joe mentioned, each of the segments I've got pretty much right in the middle of long-term guidance. So think of Marketplace, 79% to 80%; Medicare Advantage 87.5% and Medicaid, call it, 88 5%. For weightings, pretty similar to what we had this year, probably about 5% marketplace, which is a little bit smaller as the portfolio about 13% Medicare Advantage, about 82% in Medicaid. So you round all that out. The only other thing I'd say is, we finished full year Medicaid in 2022 at an 88%. We're obviously in our guidance saying an 88.5% roughly for Medicaid. So that's an additional 50 basis points for new stores, who knows redetermination or just general conservatism, but that's how I'm thinking about the MLRs there.\nJosh Raskin: Okay. So no specific explicit redetermination, but sort of capturing it in that 50 basis points of general conservatism?\nMark Keim: That's the way to think about it, Josh.\nJosh Raskin: Perfect. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe I'll just -- I know it's a smaller portion, but on the public exchanges or marketplace, your decline in enrollment. I know you've been talking about for a while that for '23, you would price for margin. Are you surprised -- was that decline in enrollment consistent with what you thought. It seems like, as we hear from your peers and everyone, there's quite a divergence in and what people are seeing. Any comment you can make on what you saw in benefits as this market become very sensitive to slight changes because some people are showing huge growth, others are not. And I'm just trying to put that in perspective. And then you're saying you do not have any assumption that you'll pick up lives on the public exchanges as redeterminations play out. Can you give us a sense of what that might look like possibly if you're not baking in the guidance? And do you have any view? I know there's been a lot of discussion about how those redetermined lives when they come on the public exchanges might affect the risk pool, I'm assuming that net-net, because you don't have anything in there, you think it would be a positive for you, even if maybe they're a little sicker than your average person on the exchanges today. But anyway, just fleshing out some of the public exchange commentary.\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, A.J. The membership results starting the year with 290,000 members, finishing the year with 230,000 members. We'll aggregate to about $1.6 billion in premium for the year. And that was fully in line with our expectations with respect to our pricing strategy. Look, we're allocators of capital and this business has shown that due to the instability of the risk pool by the introduction of the special enrollment period and other factors that it does have some inherent volatility. There also has been some irrational pricing over the past couple of years. So pushing the pause button and going silver stable, in small was exactly the right approach and the business for 2023 has landed in a good place for us to achieve our mid-single digit margin target, if we conclude that the risk pool has stabilized due to the lack of government movement of the risk pool rules, pricing is rational, we likely would conclude to allocate more capital to this line of business and grow it again. Mark, anything to add?\nMark Keim: Yeah, A.J., good morning. As Joe mentioned, starting off with 290,000 members going down, I think, to 230,000 by the end of the year, really exactly what we expected. We put 9% rate into the market this year. If you look at the mix of what we got and the pricing we put into the market, so with 9% not surprised with that result at all. Now you asked about the MLRs. To the extent we pick up folks from redetermination, I'm expecting the MLRs coming over to be quite consistent with our underwriting range. Those folks will not be new to health insurance. They will not be coming in with pent-up demand. So I'm expecting a pretty stable pool as they come over.\nA.J. Rice: Okay. That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: The next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions on the numbers side. First, on Medicaid membership, can you give us the membership? I know it's going to be flat. You talked about some new growth of acquisitions offsetting redeterminations. Can you give us those numbers in terms of what you're expecting there for each of those buckets? And then, how should we think about redeterminations from '23 into 2024 in your mind? And then on the reserves, I've heard you talk about DCP and I saw in the release that you mentioned a bunch of payments in the quarter. I did go back and take a look at fourth quarter paid versus fourth quarter kind of reserved or medical costs, last year to this year, it didn't look like there was a significant change in paid claims as a percentage of total in the fourth quarter of this year versus last year. So hoping you could just flesh that out a little bit in terms of what you were seeing there? Thanks.\nMark Keim: Great. So a bunch there, Justin. Let me start with Medicaid. We ended 2022 with about 4.7 million members. As Joe mentioned earlier, I expect to conclude 2023 with about the same. We'll go in there. The moving pieces is redetermination probably around 300,000 or more coming off, but replaced by a number of good guys. For example, the Iowa acquisition about 200,000 members, the My Choice acquisition about 40,000 members; California fee-for-service coming in a bunch of offsets there. So pretty much flat over the year from a membership perspective. On the DCP, you're talking about and the payments related to medical expenses. In general, when I look at DCP and I look at our reserving, our purchase is the same. It's the same actuarial on leadership, same approach to development and our triangles, the same external audit review. So I feel very confident about our process. What has changed is, in the fourth quarter, we added AgeWell, which brought in the LTSS membership, that membership adjudicates a whole lot faster and pays a whole lot faster. We also had the extra payment cycle. So when I look at the fourth quarter, we actually paid more than what I recorded in medical expense. So that's driving a bunch of that DCP decline from 50 to 47. Hope that helps.\nJustin Lake: Right. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: The next question comes from Calvin Sternick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nCalvin Sternick: Hey. Good morning. Just a quick follow-up. It sounded like you said if the marketplace was stable, you could look to grow it again next year. And that just sounds a little different than some of your previous comments where you kind of let the membership float up and down year-to-year. I just want to understand that in the context of your overall strategy. Is the growth outlook for Marketplace just based on your evaluation in the market this year, and that's something that you look to reevaluate next year or are you saying that you kind of want to grow Marketplace going forward.\nJoe Zubretsky: Now in that line of business, we are going to look at the stability of the risk pool, chasing and moving target with respect to the government rules around who's eligible, how many people are eligible when they become eligible has thrown in the past couple of years, that risk pool into what we consider to be a period of instability. If that should stabilize and now we're convinced that the pricing that's put into the market by us and the competitors is rational. I've always said, we could put this business back into the growth category, allocate more capital to it and grow it, but grow it in a very responsible and measured way. So I'm not sure, we're seeing anything new, but right now, keep it small silver and stable until we conclude that we should allocate more capital to it and grow it in a very measured and responsible way. And that's been our strategy all along.\nCalvin Sternick: Got it. And I know you're not forecasting growth from Marketplace from redeterminations. But just curious if you have a sense for what the recapture rate was pre-COVID. So when someone got redetermined in Medicaid, how long did they typically go uninsured before they got coverage elsewhere? And I guess how often are you able to recapture some of those members in a Molina Marketplace product?\nJoe Zubretsky: The way I would answer that is one of the reasons we haven't forecasted to capture is because the data around how it's worked in the past is pretty imprecise. I mean we could create all the models with various scenarios. We decided not to forecast it. We have operational protocols in place with member outreach in the states that allow that through text, phone and mail to help members reestablish eligibility and if determined that they are ineligible for Medicaid but eligible for a highly subsidized Marketplace product, we will then warm transfer them over to our distribution channels for Marketplace and capture them in that manner. But because this is uncharted waters, it's just -- it's never been done before, we chose not to create a model and forecast it, but consider it as upside to our membership growth.\nCalvin Sternick: All right. Great. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I guess, I'll use my question just to try to fill out a couple of the other modeling elements for 2023. Just interested if you could give us your thoughts on operating cash flow, and then also investment income and interest expense for 2023?\nMark Keim: Sure. Scott, it's Mark. So when I think about operating cash flow, I focus on cash flow at the parent because that's what restocks my firepower. I expect to take pretty meaningful dividends. I've got a few acquisitions to pay for this year and I've got some growth organically that I need to fund. So all told, at the parent, I expect to have more than $0.5 billion by the end of the year. Interest expense, you can model going forward, you know my bonds, you know my rates. On interest income, that's a wildcard, right? We're all guessing on that. finishing 2022 with about $7.5 billion of cash and investments. I expect across 2023 to end the year with about $7 billion of cash and investments, including everything at the subs. Now the wildcard here is, what kind of an interest rate to put on that, right? We've had one Fed raise already this year. If you look at the Fed Funds future rates. We've got maybe one more raise coming and maybe one or two declines back half of the year. So how do I think about that across the year? Not quite sure. I think you could model any place between mid and high 2s on a yield basis and come out with a pretty credible interest forecast there.\nScott Fidel: Okay. Thanks. And just one quick follow-up question. Just on the M&A side, how you're thinking about the pipeline and sort of the pacing of engagement in 2023. Obviously, you've got some significant installations of new business in flight. So interested in how you're thinking about layering in M&A as well. Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Yeah, Scott. Even with the significant backlog of both integrations on in-flight acquisitions and new contract implementations and our new wins, we have continued to aggressively pursue the M&A pipeline. And nothing has really changed with respect to the appetite of single state operators not for profit plans to listen to the Molina story and want to be part of this larger enterprise, where they continue -- they can continue to fulfill their local mission and have access to the broad and deep capabilities and financial resources that we bring. So it's a great story and nothing has really changed there. I would say, given the size of the pipeline and the level of activity and the maturity of some of the opportunities, we feel very confident in some announcements here in 2023.\nScott Fidel: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Hall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Hall : Hi. Thank you. Just wanted to touch on the marketplace, again and just ask about like what happened in '22. So at the beginning of the year, you're expecting 79% MLR, but Q2 I think there was a large miss really full year expectation to 84%. And then this past quarter, even excluding the 300 bps of scheduling past provided balances still ended up higher than expected. Now you're at 87% to end the year. So I thought pricing was more disciplined than you went through this major recalibration of your metal peers to cover. So I would have expected more MLR stability than what we saw. Could you walk us through about like what happened with Marketplace and why the large divergent from initial expectations?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure. And as we said in our prepared remarks, even with the exclusion of the one-time items, the COVID-related items the risk adjustment true-up in the middle of the year. And in the fourth quarter, the significant settlement of some prior year provider balances, we did not meet our expectations in marketplace. The continuing MLR drag from that significant SEP membership that renewed into the current year, continued to drag on the MLR. We now believe that the special enrollment period might produce this year 3,000 to 4,000 a month, where it was producing 20,000 to 25,000 a month and the height of the SEP gives the risk full more stability, and we're priced for it. So we did not meet our expectations even while ignoring the one-time items. But this year, we feel that with the high-single digit price increase, low-single digit trend, good visibility on our renewal membership to make sure we get appropriate risk scores that we're in good shape to hit mid-single digit margins in 2023.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: Yeah. Hi. Thanks. I wanted to follow up on the Medicaid MLR question. I appreciate the color on your expectations. How should we think about Medicaid MLR? I know you probably want to guide it too close quarterly, but do you expect to generally operate around that 88.5 level kind of consistently throughout the year or is there any slope to that line that we should maybe be thinking about? And then just to kind of put a bow on the question on the DCP for the AgeWell business, could you just give us a sense of what the DCPs would look like on a stand-alone basis, we can try to put that into context? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: So I'll turn it to Mark. But yes, given the mix of the business has changed and many of the dynamics of the businesses have changed, the seasonal patterns of how MCRs emerge, has changed slightly over time. So I'll turn it to Mark to give you a view of how Medicaid might perform over the quarters.\nMark Keim: Yeah. I'm expecting pretty flat. And if you look historically, we've run pretty consistently on Medicaid, certainly more so than Medicare in the marketplace. So I think you can model that one pretty straight line. On the AgeWell, we'll follow up with you offline. I don't have a discrete number on that. I know what it does to my weighted average, but we can follow-up with that. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Great. Thanks for the questions. You mentioned the $2 per share of earnings power from the three remaining COVID risk corridors. What's the time line to potentially realize these earnings? And then just more generally on state rates, how do you think the process plays out for states potentially revisiting rates as redeterminations occur and potential changes to the underlying risk pools take place. How do you think the states are going to approach that? Thank you.\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, Nathan. We actually consciously separated the two major components of our embedded earnings because one of them is, in our view, entirely controllable, harvesting the $4 of earning our target margins on latent contracts and M&A is something we have a proven track record of doing. We separated that from the $2 of lingering COVID era corridors because eliminating them is outside our control. They were put in place during COVID. They're articulated as being related to COVID. There are three remaining two that matter. Washington, State of Washington and Mississippi, and we believe over time that they will either be compressed or eliminated, but we don't control that. With respect to rates, I would say that states, our customers and their actuaries are vary at least aware of the potential for an acuity shift somewhere due to the redetermination process. And the fact that they're aware of it. And we would -- and if or not, we will certainly make them aware if we experience it, leads us to believe that if there is a significant shift in acuity somewhere in the book of business that the actuarial soundest principle will prevail, and we'll be able to have a productive conversation about that.\nMark Keim: Nathan, just to build on that, a number of our states were in 19 on Medicaid now. A number of our states have told us, if and when there's any impact from that redetermination, they are quite willing to reopen that to revisit it. So we feel good between that commitment and our advocacy efforts that the rates will move as they need to.\nNathan Rich: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gary Taylor with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Hey. Good morning, guys. Most of my questions are answered, just two quick ones. One on the exchange membership loss driven by repricing. Is there any particular state you'd point out in your footprint or is that pretty evenly distributed that rate increase in the enrollment decline? And then just secondly, because 99% of all the incoming investor angst about Molina is around redetermination risk and potential impact on margins, et cetera. Just wondered if you could share with us any additional work you've done on low utilizers, zero utilizers, people, populations most likely to be redetermined, et cetera? I know you've shared some of that before and just anything else you might add to provide some comfort around your Medicaid, MLR guide would be helpful, I think. Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Gary, I'll answer your second question first and then kick it to Mark for more detail. But the analysis that we've shared with you and investors is the same one, because we're looking at all the data. And there's so many theoretical arguments of why an acuity shift could happen. We focus on the numbers and the data. We look at members greater than one year duration, less than one year duration. We look at the MLR for members with less than one year duration, greater than one year duration. We look at members with zero to 25% MLRs. We look at the lapse rate of membership, which hasn't gone to zero. There still is a disenrollment rate that occurs in the Medicaid book. So we look at all that data, and it leads us to believe that while maybe somewhere there could be a slight acuity shift probably in the expansion book, not in the tenant book or the ABD book, but manageable and will be easy to deal with, particularly because the states are aware of it and we believe we'll have a productive rate discussion if and when there is a shift in acuity that makes the rates actually unsound. Mark?\nMark Keim: Yes. So we update this analysis every quarter and the conclusion is really not changing. Joe mentioned a couple of the data points, the folks with us more than one year versus less the folks in the zero to 25% MCR bucket. Expansion, we're seeing a little bit of an increase, but across the board is not much. Remember, expansion is just 30% of our total revenue. The other data point that some folks have been talking about is coordination of benefits or duplication of benefits, do we see any increase in that population. Once again, not really, a little bit of an expansion. So across the board, is there something here? Maybe, but it's really minimal. So again, not expecting much of an impact here to the extent it plays out. Now I refer back to the previous question, where I think the states are quite amenable to revisiting it. On your first question, are we fairly even distributed on our Marketplace? Yeah. I don't see any real estate density in any outliers of one state being disproportionately dense. We've got pretty good distribution across our 14 states here.\nGary Taylor: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning. So just a follow-up question on the exchange business. Here you mentioned the shift from bronze to silver has been the right move the better margin profile demonstrates that. So I know you talked about this more a year ago, but just remind us again why bronze has proven to be more tricky from your point of view. Has that gotten better or worse currently versus a year ago? What would have to change within that just to give you comfort to reexplore bronze on a greater level? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Steven, it's really an anomaly of the product design, not anything that we design, but the way the product is priced from an industry perspective, where one thing I can point to that is absolute fact is for the same member in bronze and silver with the same acuity level, the same services and therefore, the same HCCs, the risk score produces less revenue in bronze than it does in silver. And there are other aspects of it that make it just slightly less attractive. Mark?\nMark Keim: Yeah. I'd say a couple of things just building on Joe's thoughts. It's a lower actuarial value product. Sometimes that attracts folks that don't think they're going to use a product but do, the way the rules are set up, the balance on risk adjustment is a whole lot better on gold and silver than it is on bronze. And finally, just at a lower revenue load, it becomes slightly less attractive from a G&A perspective and some of our other operating ratios. You take those things all together, it's more volatile, and we just don't see the margins there.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mr. Hill, I'm not sure, some trouble hearing you. All right, your connection may have gone down. We'll go to the next questioner, who's Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. One quick clarification question before I jump into the real question. The $6 of embedded earnings, it wasn't 100% clear to me. Is that in addition to the $0.65 coming back or is that $0.55 in the 3.50?\nMark Keim: So the total of $6 is $4 of new store EPS; $2 of net effective COVID; and there are two other items in there that cancel each other out. There's the implementation costs, which are a bad guy in the current year of $0.65, but go away next year, right? And then, there's also the remaining hit on redetermination of expecting in 2024, which is also $0.65. So those two cancel each other out, you're looking at $4 and $2.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay. So that $6 on the current guidance is not on the 20, 40 earnings power number.\nMark Keim: Correct.\nKevin Fischbeck: All right. And then I just want to go back one more time to the redeterminations because it's interesting because on the one hand, it sounds like you thought about redeterminations as a potential MLR pressure in your Medicaid MLR guidance, which is different, I think, than how you've talked about it in the past, but then throughout the call, you've kind of dismissed it as a potential pressure to MLR. So just trying to understand a little bit finer like are you saying you've put it in, but you think it's set most 10 basis points or something like that, something kind of immaterial or how exactly are you thinking about and what exactly are you including in this year's guidance? And then I guess to build on that, if it is a pressure this year, would you expect that pressure to be higher or lower next year? Higher because more members are being determined or lower because states have more time to adjust rates? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Kevin, I'll give it to Mark. We are not and haven't parsed all the specific trend factors that go into an MCR forecast for the Medicaid business, but we have been outperforming even the low end of our range, a range which produces best-in-class industry margins and we just think it's not prudent to continue to forecast that we'll continue to outperform the outperforming that range. So we call it a reversion to the mean. We're forecasting an 88.5% for the Medicaid business, which is right in the middle of the range, citing medical cost pressures due to any of the items like flu, COVID, RSV and then, of course, any pressure that might be experienced with an acuity shift knowing that a significant acuity shift will probably be absorbed by retroactive rate increases. So I'm not going to parse it, but that's why we were somewhat conservative in forecasting the middle of our long-term Medicaid range rather than continuing to forecast that we outperform it.\nMark Keim: That's exactly right. So we finished last year at an 88% for the year. Our guidance anticipates an 88.5%, and we don't attribute any specific basis points to a driver. But in general, reversion to the mean flu, RSV, number of different things we could think about in there. Don't forget, we also have some new stores coming along, Iowa, the acquisition of My Choice Wisconsin. In general, just a little bit of conservatism, reversion to the mean, not attributing any basis points specifically to redetermination. But look, we've all had the conversation enough. We're acknowledging that, that's something that's potentially in there. in our reversion to the mean. Now you also mentioned maybe what happens next year. So to the extent any of this starts to manifest it will largely be back-end loaded in the year, just given the way redetermination is going to play out. I think that gives all of us a lot of time to anticipate it but just as much work with our state partners to make sure that rates in the concept of actuarial soundness anticipate the same thing.\nKevin Fischbeck: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Hi, guys. Is it working better this time around?\nOperator: Yes. Thank you, sir.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Yes, we hear you.\nGeorge Hill: Okay. Thank you, guys. Joe, and I think you kind of just touched on this in the last answer, but my question was around the $0.65 in implementation costs in 2023. I guess could you kind of break out the buckets that they're typically going to fall into. And again, this was just commented on, but I assume no part of that repeats in '24 that all goes away and there's no part of that cost structure that's durable.\nJoe Zubretsky: I'll answer the last part of your question first. On the cost for -- obviously for Iowa, California and Nebraska, yes, those once spent should not repeat themselves. But as I said many times, and not tongue in cheek, I hope in the future, we continue to have one-time implementation costs on new contract wins can have a better spend than that. There are technology implementations, which are fixed in nature. And then, of course, you need to hire the people that are going to service these businesses in advance of the revenue stream, which is a major part of the $0.65 implementation cost. Mark?\nMark Keim: Right. I'll just build on that. So if you think about the $0.65, the way I think about it, about a third of it is IT, sort of a fixed component and about two-thirds of it is staffing, mostly highly variable, right? We have to staff up ahead of day one membership. So that's the way to think about it. It obviously, it comes to us ahead of when we start booking revenue. So I wouldn't say that it goes away specifically. What it does is it goes into the anticipated margin once we run these businesses. We've talked about $3.50 of same-store -- of new store embedded earnings here. That $3.50 is, of course, after operating costs. The reason we have $0.65 is we're not booking revenue yet. So $0.65, one-third, fixed; two-thirds variable, that's the right way to think about it.\nJoe Zubretsky: Yeah. It goes away as a one-time item, but it becomes consumed into the run rate of the new contracts is the way to think about it.\nGeorge Hill: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Windley: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I hope you can hear me. I have a few small ones. In your discussion around, the state's willingness to revisit these rates, as redetermination progresses. Do you have a sense of the urgency around that? Meaning, will they do that on a relatively short notice or will they want to have that discussion in the next rate cycle or after the majority of the redetermination in their state has played out.\nJoe Zubretsky: We don't know that specifically. All we know is that they're aware of the theoretical possibility that there's an acuity shift in the book, likely, could result in prospective rate changes, but also retrospective rate changes. And it all has to be data driven. So to the point on timing, the data has to mature. The claims have to complete, the data has to be analyzed and then reasonable people will get in a room and figure out whether a rate change is necessary. So I would look at it, I don't know whether they're going to wait until the entire redetermination process is complete. But it's got to be data driven. So the data has to complete, and it has to be verifiable and actionable.\nMark Keim: And David, it's Mark. The fact that a number of these states have also led with this thought, unprompted to me is encouraging that will be somewhat proactive here.\nDavid Windley: Okay. That's interesting. Second question is any thoughts on trends post-COVID in medical costs that are more durable and maybe distinction as to whether you're betting on that or not. So thinking about things like lower ER utilization and that type of things.\nJoe Zubretsky: No, I think the medical trends we've experienced late in the year seem to have fallen into a nice pattern of, lack of volatility and understanding what COVID is actually costing sort of like on a run rate basis. It almost evolved into a $40 million to $50 million monthly run rate. And as long as it stays stable, as long as we know where the COVID infection rate is spiking, it certainly is -- the inpatient cost is certainly the more costly component, and that certainly hits the Medicare more than the Medicaid book. We have pretty good line of sight into what those services will cost us. But late in the year, it sort of settled into a nice pattern of $40 million to $50 million a month.\nDavid Windley: And then lastly, Joe, I appreciate your comments on your -- it sounds like your M&A pipeline is still very robust. Does the cost of capital change in the environment impact cadence or appetite? Has it impacted expected valuation on the seller side?\nJoe Zubretsky: No, not at all. We obviously measure the returns against our weighted average cost of capital. Obviously, we're earning more on the free cash now than we were before. So there's less of a drag. But no, it hasn't caused any change in momentum in terms of the appetite for counterparties in the market to want to speak to us and think about becoming part of the Molina enterprise.\nDavid Windley: Great. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and Molina Healthcare's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mark Keim",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss some additional details on our fourth quarter and full year performance, our strong balance sheet and our 2023 guidance. Beginning with our fourth quarter and full year results, our consolidated MCR for the fourth quarter was 88.3%, reflecting continued strong medical cost management. For the quarter, flu, RSV and COVID-related medical costs in total were largely in line with our expectations, but the impact varied by line of business, with Medicare being disproportionately impacted. Our full year consolidated MCR was 88%. This result was consistent with our expectations and was driven by the continued strong performance of our flagship Medicaid business. In Medicaid, our fourth quarter reported MCR was 87.3%. This strong performance was driven by effective medical cost management, and favorable retroactive premiums. The net effect of COVID in the quarter was a modest 30 basis points within our reported MCR. Our full year Medicaid MCR of 88% was at the low end of our long term target range and consistent with pre-pandemic levels. In Medicare, our fourth quarter reported MCR of 91.8% was driven by higher COVID, flu and the mix effect of our significant growth in MAPD. During the quarter, the net effect of COVID was 300 basis points within our reported MCR. Our full year Medicare MCR was 88.5% modestly above our long term target range and was similarly burdened by 300 basis points of net effect of COVID. In marketplace, our reported fourth quarter MCR was 93.8%. The MCR was impacted by normal seasonality and increased utilization in a handful of markets. The net effect of COVID was approximately 50 basis points within our reported MCR. In the quarter, we also settled some provider balances dating to prior years, which disproportionately impacted our Marketplace MCR by approximately 300 basis points. Our full year Marketplace MCR of 87.2% exceeded our long-term target range and includes approximately 120 basis points of net effective COVID, as well as approximately 130 basis points from the impact of a 2021 risk adjustment true-up recorded in the second quarter. Additional drivers of our strong fourth quarter and full year results include a 7.5% fourth quarter adjusted G&A ratio, which was in line with expected seasonal expenditures related to open enrollment and spending on community and charitable activities. Our full year adjusted G&A ratio improved year-over-year to 7.1% as we remain focused on delivering fixed cost leverage as we grow, even while making the appropriate investments to sustain our growth. Fourth quarter and full year results also feature higher net investment income as expected from recent increases in interest rates. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and we continue to be confident in our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 47%, about three days lower sequentially. The decline was driven by the increased mix of LTSS claims, which settled more quickly, resulting from the closing of the AgeWell acquisition as well as an additional payment cycle in the quarter. Our capital foundation remains strong. Debt at the end of the quarter was 1.8 times trailing 12-month EBITDA, and our debt-to-total cap ratio was 44.9. On a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.5 times and 40.7%, respectively. Our leverage remains low. All bond maturities are long dated on average eight years and our weighted average cost of debt fixed at just 4%. In the quarter, we harvested $268 million of subsidiary dividends and repurchased approximately 590,000 of our shares. Parent company cash at the end of the quarter was $375 million. With substantial incremental debt capacity, cash on hand and strong cash flow to the parent, we have ample dry powder to drive our organic and inorganic growth strategies. 2022 full year operating cash flow was lower compared to the prior year, primarily due to the cash settlement in 2022 of large prior year marketplace risk adjustment and Medicaid risk corridor payments. Normalizing for the timing of these payments, 2022 operating cash flow was $1.6 billion. Turning now to our 2023 guidance, beginning with membership. In Medicaid, we expect organic growth, the midyear inception of the Iowa contract and membership from our My Choice Wisconsin acquisition to be largely offset by the second quarter resumption of redeterminations. We expect this to result in 2023 year-end membership of approximately 4.7 million members. In Medicare, based on our performance in the annual enrollment period, we expect to begin the year with 160,000 members and continue to grow during the year, ending 2023 with total membership of approximately 175,000 members. Our Medicare membership growth for 2023 is expected to be evenly split between our D-SNP and MAPD products. In Marketplace, based on open enrollment, we expect to begin 2023 with approximately 290,000 members, reflecting our pricing strategy to achieve target margins in this business for 2023. Accounting for a limited SEP and normal levels of attrition through the year. We expect to end 2023 with approximately 230,000 members. We continue to treat any marketplace membership from Medicaid redeterminations as upside to these projections. Moving on to premium revenue. Our 2023 premium revenue guidance is $32 billion, representing 4% growth from 2022 Our revenue guidance is comprised of several items, $1.2 billion for the full year impact of AgeWell and expected revenue from the My Choice Wisconsin acquisition when closed. $1 billion of organic growth in Medicaid and Medicare and $900 million for the midyear inception of our new Iowa contract. Several offsetting items include: $600 million for the known pharmacy carve-outs, $500 million for the impact of the resumption of redeterminations beginning in April, $600 million for the lower Marketplace membership, and $300 million in 2022 pass-through revenue that we don't expect to recur in 2023. Turning to earnings guidance. We expect full year adjusted earnings to be at least $19.75 per share. Our EPS guidance reflects the realization of approximately $1 per share of 2022 embedded earnings, consisting of the contribution from acquisitions and a portion of the net effect of COVID partially offset by the impact of redeterminations. To this, we add $1.50 for the underlying organic growth plus several operating levers, including our real estate reduction strategy, the full year effect of our PBM contract and net investment income, partially offset by the negative impact of known pharmacy carve-outs. These drivers combined to deliver core earnings per share of at least $20.40. Recognizing the one-time non-recurring implementation costs in 2023 for our new contract wins that we now project to be $0.65 per share, yields our 2023 earnings per share guidance of at least $19.75. Moving on to select P&L guidance metrics. We expect our consolidated medical care ratio to be approximately 88%, consistent with our 2022 results. We expect our adjusted G&A ratio to fall slightly to 7%, even while absorbing the impact of the one-time non-recurring implementation costs for our new contract wins. This reflects disciplined cost management and fixed cost leverage from our revenue growth. Excluding the new contract implementation costs, our adjusted G&A ratio would have improved year-over-year to 6.8%. The effective tax rate is expected to be 25.3%, adjusted after-tax margin is expected to be 3.5%, well within our long-term target range. Weighted average share count is expected to be 58.1 million shares. And we expect our quarterly adjusted earnings per share profile to be fairly flat over the year, with the first two quarters of the year at roughly $5 each. As Joe mentioned, our 2023 new store embedded earnings power is at least $4 per share and is comprised of at least $3.50 from our three recent new contract wins, and $0.50 per share for AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin acquisitions, achieving full accretion. We continue to carry approximately $2 for COVID era risk corridors providing additional potential upside to be at least $4 of new store growth embedded earnings. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for some concluding remarks. Joe? That's right, Joe. Josh, it's Mark. Total guidance at 88% MLR. As Joe mentioned, each of the segments I've got pretty much right in the middle of long-term guidance. So think of Marketplace, 79% to 80%; Medicare Advantage 87.5% and Medicaid, call it, 88 5%. For weightings, pretty similar to what we had this year, probably about 5% marketplace, which is a little bit smaller as the portfolio about 13% Medicare Advantage, about 82% in Medicaid. So you round all that out. The only other thing I'd say is, we finished full year Medicaid in 2022 at an 88%. We're obviously in our guidance saying an 88.5% roughly for Medicaid. So that's an additional 50 basis points for new stores, who knows redetermination or just general conservatism, but that's how I'm thinking about the MLRs there. That's the way to think about it, Josh. Yeah, A.J., good morning. As Joe mentioned, starting off with 290,000 members going down, I think, to 230,000 by the end of the year, really exactly what we expected. We put 9% rate into the market this year. If you look at the mix of what we got and the pricing we put into the market, so with 9% not surprised with that result at all. Now you asked about the MLRs. To the extent we pick up folks from redetermination, I'm expecting the MLRs coming over to be quite consistent with our underwriting range. Those folks will not be new to health insurance. They will not be coming in with pent-up demand. So I'm expecting a pretty stable pool as they come over. Great. So a bunch there, Justin. Let me start with Medicaid. We ended 2022 with about 4.7 million members. As Joe mentioned earlier, I expect to conclude 2023 with about the same. We'll go in there. The moving pieces is redetermination probably around 300,000 or more coming off, but replaced by a number of good guys. For example, the Iowa acquisition about 200,000 members, the My Choice acquisition about 40,000 members; California fee-for-service coming in a bunch of offsets there. So pretty much flat over the year from a membership perspective. On the DCP, you're talking about and the payments related to medical expenses. In general, when I look at DCP and I look at our reserving, our purchase is the same. It's the same actuarial on leadership, same approach to development and our triangles, the same external audit review. So I feel very confident about our process. What has changed is, in the fourth quarter, we added AgeWell, which brought in the LTSS membership, that membership adjudicates a whole lot faster and pays a whole lot faster. We also had the extra payment cycle. So when I look at the fourth quarter, we actually paid more than what I recorded in medical expense. So that's driving a bunch of that DCP decline from 50 to 47. Hope that helps. Sure. Scott, it's Mark. So when I think about operating cash flow, I focus on cash flow at the parent because that's what restocks my firepower. I expect to take pretty meaningful dividends. I've got a few acquisitions to pay for this year and I've got some growth organically that I need to fund. So all told, at the parent, I expect to have more than $0.5 billion by the end of the year. Interest expense, you can model going forward, you know my bonds, you know my rates. On interest income, that's a wildcard, right? We're all guessing on that. finishing 2022 with about $7.5 billion of cash and investments. I expect across 2023 to end the year with about $7 billion of cash and investments, including everything at the subs. Now the wildcard here is, what kind of an interest rate to put on that, right? We've had one Fed raise already this year. If you look at the Fed Funds future rates. We've got maybe one more raise coming and maybe one or two declines back half of the year. So how do I think about that across the year? Not quite sure. I think you could model any place between mid and high 2s on a yield basis and come out with a pretty credible interest forecast there. Yeah. I'm expecting pretty flat. And if you look historically, we've run pretty consistently on Medicaid, certainly more so than Medicare in the marketplace. So I think you can model that one pretty straight line. On the AgeWell, we'll follow up with you offline. I don't have a discrete number on that. I know what it does to my weighted average, but we can follow-up with that. Thank you. Nathan, just to build on that, a number of our states were in 19 on Medicaid now. A number of our states have told us, if and when there's any impact from that redetermination, they are quite willing to reopen that to revisit it. So we feel good between that commitment and our advocacy efforts that the rates will move as they need to. Yes. So we update this analysis every quarter and the conclusion is really not changing. Joe mentioned a couple of the data points, the folks with us more than one year versus less the folks in the zero to 25% MCR bucket. Expansion, we're seeing a little bit of an increase, but across the board is not much. Remember, expansion is just 30% of our total revenue. The other data point that some folks have been talking about is coordination of benefits or duplication of benefits, do we see any increase in that population. Once again, not really, a little bit of an expansion. So across the board, is there something here? Maybe, but it's really minimal. So again, not expecting much of an impact here to the extent it plays out. Now I refer back to the previous question, where I think the states are quite amenable to revisiting it. On your first question, are we fairly even distributed on our Marketplace? Yeah. I don't see any real estate density in any outliers of one state being disproportionately dense. We've got pretty good distribution across our 14 states here. Yeah. I'd say a couple of things just building on Joe's thoughts. It's a lower actuarial value product. Sometimes that attracts folks that don't think they're going to use a product but do, the way the rules are set up, the balance on risk adjustment is a whole lot better on gold and silver than it is on bronze. And finally, just at a lower revenue load, it becomes slightly less attractive from a G&A perspective and some of our other operating ratios. You take those things all together, it's more volatile, and we just don't see the margins there. So the total of $6 is $4 of new store EPS; $2 of net effective COVID; and there are two other items in there that cancel each other out. There's the implementation costs, which are a bad guy in the current year of $0.65, but go away next year, right? And then, there's also the remaining hit on redetermination of expecting in 2024, which is also $0.65. So those two cancel each other out, you're looking at $4 and $2. Correct. That's exactly right. So we finished last year at an 88% for the year. Our guidance anticipates an 88.5%, and we don't attribute any specific basis points to a driver. But in general, reversion to the mean flu, RSV, number of different things we could think about in there. Don't forget, we also have some new stores coming along, Iowa, the acquisition of My Choice Wisconsin. In general, just a little bit of conservatism, reversion to the mean, not attributing any basis points specifically to redetermination. But look, we've all had the conversation enough. We're acknowledging that, that's something that's potentially in there. in our reversion to the mean. Now you also mentioned maybe what happens next year. So to the extent any of this starts to manifest it will largely be back-end loaded in the year, just given the way redetermination is going to play out. I think that gives all of us a lot of time to anticipate it but just as much work with our state partners to make sure that rates in the concept of actuarial soundness anticipate the same thing. Right. I'll just build on that. So if you think about the $0.65, the way I think about it, about a third of it is IT, sort of a fixed component and about two-thirds of it is staffing, mostly highly variable, right? We have to staff up ahead of day one membership. So that's the way to think about it. It obviously, it comes to us ahead of when we start booking revenue. So I wouldn't say that it goes away specifically. What it does is it goes into the anticipated margin once we run these businesses. We've talked about $3.50 of same-store -- of new store embedded earnings here. That $3.50 is, of course, after operating costs. The reason we have $0.65 is we're not booking revenue yet. So $0.65, one-third, fixed; two-thirds variable, that's the right way to think about it. And David, it's Mark. The fact that a number of these states have also led with this thought, unprompted to me is encouraging that will be somewhat proactive here."

            "name": "Joe Zubretsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe, and good morning. Today, we will provide updates on several topics. Our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, our initial 2023 revenue and earnings guidance, our growth initiatives and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth, and our outlook on premium revenue for 2024, given our new business successes in 2022. Let me start with the fourth quarter highlights. Last night, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.10, representing 42% growth year-over-year. Our fourth quarter 88.3% consolidated medical care ratio, 7.5% adjusted G&A ratio, and 3.9% adjusted pretax margin demonstrate continued strong operating performance. The fourth quarter completes another strong year of operating and financial performance. For the full year, we grew premium revenue by 15% to approximately $31 billion and grew adjusted earnings per share by 32% to $17.92. Our full year adjusted pretax margin of 4.4% was squarely in line with our long-term targets. Medicaid, our flagship business representing approximately 80% of enterprise revenue continues to produce very strong and predictable operating results and cash flows. For the year, we grew membership by approximately 10% and premium revenue by 21%, driven by the inception of our Nevada Medicaid contract, recently closed acquisitions and organic growth. The rate environment is stable and we are executing on the fundamentals of medical cost management. The full year reported MCR of 88% is at the low end of our long term target range and consistent with pre-pandemic levels, reflecting the underlying strength of our diversified portfolio and our focused execution. Our high acuity Medicare niche serving low income members representing 12% of enterprise revenue, continues to grow organically and demonstrate strong operating performance. For the year, we grew membership by 10% and premium revenue by 13%. Membership growth was driven primarily by our low income MAPD product, which more than doubled in 2022. The full year reported MCR of 88.5% was modestly above our long term target range, but includes approximately 300 basis points of pressure from COVID-related care. In Marketplace, the smallest of our three lines of business, we repositioned the business both in terms of its size in the portfolio and metallic mix. On a pure period basis, the business performed at roughly breakeven. While the financial performance did not meet our initial expectations for the year, we believe we have positioned our marketplace business to achieve target margins in 2023. Turning now to the execution of our growth strategy for the year. The successes in 2022 were many. On the M&A front, we closed on the acquisition of Cigna's Texas Medicaid business at the beginning of the year. And the AgeWell acquisition, at the beginning of the fourth quarter. In July, we announced the My Choice Wisconsin acquisition further adding to our market leading LTSS franchise. Our performance on Medicaid RFPs in the year was exceptional. We renewed our contract in Mississippi, doubled the size of our California contract for 2024 and won two new contracts: first in Iowa and then Nebraska for a 100% win rate on RFP responses submitted. In total, we project that these RFP wins for the year will add $4.4 billion in run rate premium revenue. In summary, our full year 2022 enterprise results continue to demonstrate our ability to produce excellent margins, while expanding our franchise by growing premium revenues. Turning now to our 2023 guidance. You can easily see the results of the repeatable earnings pattern we have created. We built new store contract backlog and harvest the earnings as the contracts and acquisitions mature. Meanwhile, we continue to focus on the operating fundamentals and drive operational improvements, which allows us to grow the core business at attractive margins. With regard to our 2023 guidance, we project 2023 premium revenue of $32 billion, representing a 19% compound annual growth rate since our pivot to growth in 2019. The 2022 earnings per share of $17.92 serves as a solid high margin earnings jump-off point. We expect that $1 per share of prior embedded earnings will emerge into 2023 earnings. We expect to produce $1.50 per share of core growth and operational improvements. We expect all of these elements will combine to produce 2023 core earnings per share of at least $20.40, offset by $0.65 per share of one-time contract implementation costs, which results in our 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $19.75. The operating improvements supporting the margins in our guidance are durable. The various elements which could impact earnings, COVID, flu, RSV, any margin impacts from redeterminations have been considered informing our guidance. The metrics implied by guidance are squarely in line with our long-term target ranges. As our guidance produces a 4.7% pretax margin, with a growth rate of 14% in core earnings and 10% on a reported adjusted basis. This is an attractive growth profile in a model that is repeatable. In addition to the growth within our guidance, we continue to build an earnings base for the future in the form of our embedded earnings profile, which provides a forward view of our earnings potential beyond 2023. The new store component of our embedded earnings defined as earnings from achieving target margins on acquisitions and new Medicaid contract wins is now at least $4 per share. The ongoing net effect of COVID, which at this point is the continuing earnings impact from the three remaining risk corridors, adds $2 per share of additional upside to this figure. This latent earnings growth estimate does not take into consideration any future organic growth or future strategic initiatives. Turning now to our growth strategy. We have taken major strides toward our $42 billion 2025 premium goal. At this early stage, we already have a clear line of sight to $35.5 billion in 2024. The key to our strategy is balanced, a stellar record of new contract wins, Kentucky, Nevada and now filling in the middle part of the country. The doubling of the size of our California business, including significant expansion in Los Angeles County, preserving and securing all of our incumbent state contracts and no large reprocurements in the near-term, continuing to build the M&A pipeline as this aspect of our strategy has already produced seven transactions for $10 billion. in revenue. Not to mention, organic growth, one member at a time by focusing on greater member attraction and retention and overcoming the regulatory headwinds of redeterminations and pharmacy carve outs. With that as the backdrop, I will now provide an update on some specific in flight opportunities related to our long term growth strategy. At the end of January, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission posted a notice on its website indicating that it was issuing a notice of intent to award our Texas Health Plan, a contract for all of our existing eight service areas in the state. We expect to be able to provide more of an update once these contracts have been finalized and signed. Our RFP response for the Indiana LTSS program has been submitted, it is pending evaluation and subsequent award announcement. In New Mexico, the state announced it has terminated the RFP that was in process and according to their press release, intends to issue an expedited reprocurement as soon as possible. We have many other new state business development initiatives well underway, including the potential for expanding to our former nearly statewide footprint in Florida. Our growing Medicaid footprint still only represents half of the 41 states with managed Medicaid. With multiple new state RFP opportunities over the coming years, and our demonstrated capabilities, referenceability and track record, we remain confident in our ability to win additional new state contracts. Our acquisition pipeline remains replete with actionable opportunities. While the timing of transactions remains difficult to predict, the strength of our pipeline and our track record of success gives us confidence in our ability to drive further growth from this important element of our growth strategy. In summary, we are very pleased with our business performance and the progress made in 2022 on our growth strategy, which has created a solid and growing financial profile. At least $20.40 of core earnings per share and $19.75 per share of adjusted earnings in 2023. Current new store embedded earnings power of at least $4 per share with an additional $2 of upside, if and when the few remaining COVID era corridors are eliminated. And $35.5 billion of identified premium revenue in 2024. All of this is before any impact from the continued execution of our growth initiatives. Of course, we could not accomplish all of this without our excellent management team and dedicated associates now approaching 15,000 strong, who in concert with our hallmark, proprietary operating model and management process have produced these results. To the entire team, I once again extend my deepest thanks in heartfelt appreciation. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional insight on the financials. Mark? Thanks, Mark. In looking back over the past five years, we pause briefly to reflect on our company's accomplishments. We won $5 billion in new Medicaid awards over the period and defended all of our existing contracts. We acquired $10 billion in profitable revenue. In short, we doubled the revenue base. We have produced industry-leading margins in our core products, averaging 4% to 5% on a pretax basis. The top line growth and margin expansion allowed us to grow earnings per share from a loss in 2017 to nearly $20 per share in 2023 guidance. We've ascended to Fortune 125 status and were promoted into the S&P 500. We have a pure-play government managed care franchise to grow and build on. We only take this retrospective journey to express our excitement, enthusiasm and energy for the next five years. There are so many more opportunities to continue to grow and expand our franchise. As we say here at the company, reaching milestones is not a cost for celebration, but a cause for consternation as reaching one merely marks the point in time to set new aspirational goals. We plan to share our view over the next five years with you at an Investor Day later this year. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Sure, Josh. That is correct. We are going to produce a consolidated medical care ratio of 88% in each of 2022 and our guidance through 2023. We get there in a slightly different way year-over-year. Obviously, with our repositioning of the Marketplace business, we're projecting that with pricing actions, with the small silver and stable strategy, we will bring that MCR down within the long-term range at the high end of the long-term range of 78% to 80%. Medicare slightly underperformed our long-term target for the year because of 300 basis points of pressure. We now project that Medicare will come into its long-term target range, perhaps in the middle of that range. And yes, because we have been outperforming our long-term guidance range in Medicaid, 80% of our revenue, we are forecasting a reversion to the mean, considering all the impacts of flu, RSV, COVID, any potential nuanced reaction to retermination process puts us in the middle of the range at 88.5%, our long-term range being 88% to 89%. So that's the line of business tail of the tape for MCR projection into 2023. Sure, A.J. The membership results starting the year with 290,000 members, finishing the year with 230,000 members. We'll aggregate to about $1.6 billion in premium for the year. And that was fully in line with our expectations with respect to our pricing strategy. Look, we're allocators of capital and this business has shown that due to the instability of the risk pool by the introduction of the special enrollment period and other factors that it does have some inherent volatility. There also has been some irrational pricing over the past couple of years. So pushing the pause button and going silver stable, in small was exactly the right approach and the business for 2023 has landed in a good place for us to achieve our mid-single digit margin target, if we conclude that the risk pool has stabilized due to the lack of government movement of the risk pool rules, pricing is rational, we likely would conclude to allocate more capital to this line of business and grow it again. Mark, anything to add? Now in that line of business, we are going to look at the stability of the risk pool, chasing and moving target with respect to the government rules around who's eligible, how many people are eligible when they become eligible has thrown in the past couple of years, that risk pool into what we consider to be a period of instability. If that should stabilize and now we're convinced that the pricing that's put into the market by us and the competitors is rational. I've always said, we could put this business back into the growth category, allocate more capital to it and grow it, but grow it in a very responsible and measured way. So I'm not sure, we're seeing anything new, but right now, keep it small silver and stable until we conclude that we should allocate more capital to it and grow it in a very measured and responsible way. And that's been our strategy all along. The way I would answer that is one of the reasons we haven't forecasted to capture is because the data around how it's worked in the past is pretty imprecise. I mean we could create all the models with various scenarios. We decided not to forecast it. We have operational protocols in place with member outreach in the states that allow that through text, phone and mail to help members reestablish eligibility and if determined that they are ineligible for Medicaid but eligible for a highly subsidized Marketplace product, we will then warm transfer them over to our distribution channels for Marketplace and capture them in that manner. But because this is uncharted waters, it's just -- it's never been done before, we chose not to create a model and forecast it, but consider it as upside to our membership growth. Yeah, Scott. Even with the significant backlog of both integrations on in-flight acquisitions and new contract implementations and our new wins, we have continued to aggressively pursue the M&A pipeline. And nothing has really changed with respect to the appetite of single state operators not for profit plans to listen to the Molina story and want to be part of this larger enterprise, where they continue -- they can continue to fulfill their local mission and have access to the broad and deep capabilities and financial resources that we bring. So it's a great story and nothing has really changed there. I would say, given the size of the pipeline and the level of activity and the maturity of some of the opportunities, we feel very confident in some announcements here in 2023. Sure. And as we said in our prepared remarks, even with the exclusion of the one-time items, the COVID-related items the risk adjustment true-up in the middle of the year. And in the fourth quarter, the significant settlement of some prior year provider balances, we did not meet our expectations in marketplace. The continuing MLR drag from that significant SEP membership that renewed into the current year, continued to drag on the MLR. We now believe that the special enrollment period might produce this year 3,000 to 4,000 a month, where it was producing 20,000 to 25,000 a month and the height of the SEP gives the risk full more stability, and we're priced for it. So we did not meet our expectations even while ignoring the one-time items. But this year, we feel that with the high-single digit price increase, low-single digit trend, good visibility on our renewal membership to make sure we get appropriate risk scores that we're in good shape to hit mid-single digit margins in 2023. So I'll turn it to Mark. But yes, given the mix of the business has changed and many of the dynamics of the businesses have changed, the seasonal patterns of how MCRs emerge, has changed slightly over time. So I'll turn it to Mark to give you a view of how Medicaid might perform over the quarters. Sure, Nathan. We actually consciously separated the two major components of our embedded earnings because one of them is, in our view, entirely controllable, harvesting the $4 of earning our target margins on latent contracts and M&A is something we have a proven track record of doing. We separated that from the $2 of lingering COVID era corridors because eliminating them is outside our control. They were put in place during COVID. They're articulated as being related to COVID. There are three remaining two that matter. Washington, State of Washington and Mississippi, and we believe over time that they will either be compressed or eliminated, but we don't control that. With respect to rates, I would say that states, our customers and their actuaries are vary at least aware of the potential for an acuity shift somewhere due to the redetermination process. And the fact that they're aware of it. And we would -- and if or not, we will certainly make them aware if we experience it, leads us to believe that if there is a significant shift in acuity somewhere in the book of business that the actuarial soundest principle will prevail, and we'll be able to have a productive conversation about that. Gary, I'll answer your second question first and then kick it to Mark for more detail. But the analysis that we've shared with you and investors is the same one, because we're looking at all the data. And there's so many theoretical arguments of why an acuity shift could happen. We focus on the numbers and the data. We look at members greater than one year duration, less than one year duration. We look at the MLR for members with less than one year duration, greater than one year duration. We look at members with zero to 25% MLRs. We look at the lapse rate of membership, which hasn't gone to zero. There still is a disenrollment rate that occurs in the Medicaid book. So we look at all that data, and it leads us to believe that while maybe somewhere there could be a slight acuity shift probably in the expansion book, not in the tenant book or the ABD book, but manageable and will be easy to deal with, particularly because the states are aware of it and we believe we'll have a productive rate discussion if and when there is a shift in acuity that makes the rates actually unsound. Mark? Steven, it's really an anomaly of the product design, not anything that we design, but the way the product is priced from an industry perspective, where one thing I can point to that is absolute fact is for the same member in bronze and silver with the same acuity level, the same services and therefore, the same HCCs, the risk score produces less revenue in bronze than it does in silver. And there are other aspects of it that make it just slightly less attractive. Mark? Kevin, I'll give it to Mark. We are not and haven't parsed all the specific trend factors that go into an MCR forecast for the Medicaid business, but we have been outperforming even the low end of our range, a range which produces best-in-class industry margins and we just think it's not prudent to continue to forecast that we'll continue to outperform the outperforming that range. So we call it a reversion to the mean. We're forecasting an 88.5% for the Medicaid business, which is right in the middle of the range, citing medical cost pressures due to any of the items like flu, COVID, RSV and then, of course, any pressure that might be experienced with an acuity shift knowing that a significant acuity shift will probably be absorbed by retroactive rate increases. So I'm not going to parse it, but that's why we were somewhat conservative in forecasting the middle of our long-term Medicaid range rather than continuing to forecast that we outperform it. I'll answer the last part of your question first. On the cost for -- obviously for Iowa, California and Nebraska, yes, those once spent should not repeat themselves. But as I said many times, and not tongue in cheek, I hope in the future, we continue to have one-time implementation costs on new contract wins can have a better spend than that. There are technology implementations, which are fixed in nature. And then, of course, you need to hire the people that are going to service these businesses in advance of the revenue stream, which is a major part of the $0.65 implementation cost. Mark? Yeah. It goes away as a one-time item, but it becomes consumed into the run rate of the new contracts is the way to think about it. We don't know that specifically. All we know is that they're aware of the theoretical possibility that there's an acuity shift in the book, likely, could result in prospective rate changes, but also retrospective rate changes. And it all has to be data driven. So to the point on timing, the data has to mature. The claims have to complete, the data has to be analyzed and then reasonable people will get in a room and figure out whether a rate change is necessary. So I would look at it, I don't know whether they're going to wait until the entire redetermination process is complete. But it's got to be data driven. So the data has to complete, and it has to be verifiable and actionable. No, I think the medical trends we've experienced late in the year seem to have fallen into a nice pattern of, lack of volatility and understanding what COVID is actually costing sort of like on a run rate basis. It almost evolved into a $40 million to $50 million monthly run rate. And as long as it stays stable, as long as we know where the COVID infection rate is spiking, it certainly is -- the inpatient cost is certainly the more costly component, and that certainly hits the Medicare more than the Medicaid book. We have pretty good line of sight into what those services will cost us. But late in the year, it sort of settled into a nice pattern of $40 million to $50 million a month. No, not at all. We obviously measure the returns against our weighted average cost of capital. Obviously, we're earning more on the free cash now than we were before. So there's less of a drag. But no, it hasn't caused any change in momentum in terms of the appetite for counterparties in the market to want to speak to us and think about becoming part of the Molina enterprise."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nJoe Krocheski: Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our third quarter earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made are as of today, Thursday, October 27, 2022, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures for 2022 can be found in our third quarter 2022 press release. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of our adjusted earnings outlook with GAAP measures for the years beyond 2022 without unreasonable efforts due to the difficulty of predicting the timing and amounts of various items within a reasonable range. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2022 guidance, our long-term growth strategy, our recent RFP awards and RFP submission and the projected revenue and earnings growth associated with these awards, our outlook with regard to both fiscal year 2023 and 2024, our acquisition and M&A activity. The COVID-19 pandemic can redetermination and our current and future competitive earnings power and margins. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise the listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?\nJoe Zubretsky: Thank you, Joe, and good morning. Today, we will provide updates on several topics, our financial results for the third quarter of 2022, our full year 2022 guidance in the context of our third quarter results, our growth initiatives and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Our outlook on 2023 premium revenue and earnings growth and lastly, given our recent new business success and early outlook on premium revenue for 2024. Let me start with the third quarter highlights. Last night, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.36, representing 54% growth year-over-year. Our earnings growth reflects strong premium revenue growth, sustained target margins and the realization of a meaningful portion of our 2021 embedded earnings. Our third quarter 88.4% consolidated medical care ratio, 6.9% adjusted G&A ratio and 4.3% pretax margin demonstrate strong operating performance even as we navigate prolonged pandemic-related challenges. Our year-to-date performance, highlighted by an 87.9% MCR, a 6.9% adjusted G&A ratio and a 4.5% pretax margin is squarely in line with our long-term targets. This reported pretax margin increases when normalized for the effects of revenue pass-through payments and the marketplace prior year risk adjustment true-up previously reported. Medicaid, our flagship business, representing approximately 80% of enterprise revenue, continues to produce very strong and predictable operating results and cash flows. The rate environment is stable. COVID costs have tempered and we are executing on the sound fundamentals of medical cost management. The year-to-date reported MCR of 88.2% is at the lower end of our long-term target range, reflecting the underlying strength of our diversified portfolio and our focused execution. Our high acuity Medicare niche serving low-income members, representing 12% of enterprise revenue, continues to grow organically and demonstrate strong operating performance. The year-to-date reported MCR of 87.4%, even with sustained cost pressure from COVID-related care is fairly in line with our long-term target range. Marketplace, at 7% of enterprise revenue, continues to track towards a return to profitability in 2022 on a pure period basis. We have succeeded in keeping the business small, keeping it silver and keeping it stable. In summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. We executed well, delivered solid operating earnings and continued to deliver on our growth strategy. Turning now to our 2022 guidance. We now project our 2022 premium revenue to be approximately $30.5 billion or $500 million above our previous guidance. From the time of our pivot to growth in 2019, this updated 2022 revenue guidance represents a 3-year, 23% compound annual growth rate. Excluding the estimated impact of the redetermination pause, our 3-year compound annual growth rate is 19%. In addition, we have increased our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance to at least $17.75. This represents a $0.75 per share increase compared to our initial 2022 guidance despite absorbing an additional $0.50 per share from the net effect of COVID and $0.44 per share for the prior year Marketplace risk adjustment true-up. As we prepare to head into 2023, we have a very solid earnings baseline off of which to grow. Turning now to an update on our long-term strategy for sustaining profitable growth. We are executing well on the many dimensions of our growth strategy. On the RFP front, we continue to build on our track record of success in both retaining our existing Medicaid contracts and winning new ones. The quarter's highlights were many. In Mississippi, Molina was selected to continue serving Medicaid members across the entire state. In California, we've not only retained our current footprint, but we're also selected to serve the important county of Los Angeles, which will add significant membership in premium revenue. In Iowa, we were awarded a new statewide contract entering as one of 3 managed care organizations serving a total managed Medicaid population currently at 800,000. And we were awarded a new statewide contract in Nebraska as one of 3 managed care organizations serving a total managed Medicaid population currently at 360,000. Once it commences in January 2024, the California contract award is projected to provide membership growth, measured on current membership roles in excess of 1.2 million members as well as the associated significant premium revenue growth. This projection is based on the state's own published county-by-county Medicaid membership count. We were 1 of 2 plans selected in each of Sacramento County and San Diego County, which are existing Molina counties, but where we now expect additional membership in 2024. We were also selected to be the sole commercial health plan in Los Angeles County, which is a 2-plan model county. Finally, we also won awards in both San Bernardino and Riverside Counties known as the Inland Empire, where we expect our current membership levels to remain the same. With awards in each of these 5 California counties, we were successful in being selected in every county on which we bid. We are very confident in our ability to operationally prepare for this expansion. We have a deep knowledge of the [Medicare] program, and we have an existing long-term presence in Los Angeles. We have already commenced the 15-month build-out for this significant expansion. In combination, all of these contracts will expand our Medicaid portfolio to 20 states. These new contracts are expected to add approximately $5.8 billion in annual premium revenue and at least $3 of earnings per share, once we achieve full run rate margins. Looking forward, our RFP response has been submitted for [Texas STAR+PLUS]. It is pending evaluation and subsequent award announcement. We believe we are well-positioned to retain this contract due to our track record of operational and clinical excellence, standing and reputation, cutting-edge innovation and the demonstrated ability to right winning proposals. With multiple new state RFP opportunities over the coming years, we remain confident in our ability to win additional new state contracts. We have submitted our proposal for the LTSS contract in the state of Indiana, and have many other new state business development initiatives well underway, including the potential for returning to New Mexico and expanding to our former nearly statewide footprint in Florida. In summary, our track record of success validates our long-term revenue growth strategy and its value creation potential. Before I turn to some further particulars regarding our outlook for both 2023 and 2024, I want to briefly put a point on the magnitude of the company's achievements in the third quarter and what those achievements mean for the future of our company. Stated at a high level, the new business wins will have a profound impact on our company over the next few years. As a matter of year-by-year sequencing, in 2023, we will be busy scaling our proven operating infrastructure to service this new revenue, incurring front-end implementation costs. In 2024, we expect to achieve full run rate contract revenue with earnings beginning to emerge from this significant new revenue. And finally, in 2025, we expect to achieve our full run rate target margins. Against the background of this sequencing and high-level view, I will now provide some color regarding our 2023 outlook. 2023 will be an important year as we prepare for our new revenue growth. We will be hiring and training additional staff to expand our already expert teams and extending our systems to ensure ample capacity. We expect that the onetime nonrecurring expense in 2023 associated with this robust growth will be $0.75 per share. Given our strong current performance, we are raising our 2023 core earnings outlook, the earnings that would have been produced by our company before these recent wins from at least $20 per share to at least $20.25 per share. This core earnings outlook, a meaningful measure of underlying performance, represents 14% growth on today's updated 2022 guidance of at least $17.75 per share. When we include the onetime nonrecurring $0.75 per share implementation costs, our reported earnings per share outlook for 2023 is now at least $19.50. Turning now to our premium revenue outlook for 2024. While it is far too early to provide specific financial guidance for 2024, we do have line of sight to many of the premium revenue growth drivers that we expect to materialize in 2024. First, we expect to continue to grow organically in our current geographic footprint. Second, we expect our recent RFP wins in California, Iowa and Nebraska as well as our AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin acquisitions to be operating at or near full run rate revenue. And third, we expect that these growth drivers will be partially offset by the impact of redeterminations and through potential pharmacy carve-outs. Combined, these revenue building blocks create an attractive growth trajectory and path to at least $37 billion in premium revenue in 2024. With over a year to go, additional M&A announcements and new Medicaid procurement wins would add to this already attractive 2024 premium revenue picture. A few words on our embedded earnings profile, which provides a forward view of our earnings potential beyond 2023. As previously described, the $5.8 billion in incremental revenue in 2024 from our recent RFP wins adds at least $3 per share in incremental earnings. These earnings are anticipated to begin to emerge in 2024 when all of our new RFP wins will then be operational. With this $3 per share addition, our total 2023 embedded earnings power is now nearly $6 per share. This is strong latent capacity to achieve our near- and long-term earnings objectives. In summary, we are very pleased with our business performance and the exciting developments over the past few months. Combined, this has created a solid and growing financial profile, at least $20.25 per share of core earnings in 2023, $37 billion of premium revenue in 2024. 2023 embedded earnings power of nearly $6 per share and all of this is before any impact from the continued execution of our growth initiatives. Of course, we could not accomplish all of this without our excellent management team and dedicated associates, now approaching 15,000 strong, who in concert with our hallmark proprietary operating model and management process, have produced these results. To the entire team, I once again extend my deepest thanks and heartfelt appreciation. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional insight on the financials. Mark?\nMark Keim: Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss some additional details of our third quarter performance, our strong balance sheet, our updated 2022 guidance and some additional color on the revenue and EPS building blocks driving our outlooks for 2023 and 2024. Beginning with our third quarter results. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was 88.5%. This strong performance squarely in line with our long-term target range, was driven by strong medical cost management. The net effect of COVID in the quarter was a modest 10 basis points within our reported MCR. Year-to-date, our reported MCR was 88.2% and at the lower end of our long-term target range. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 88.7%, a figure which is above our long-term target range, driven by higher COVID and non-COVID utilization. During the quarter, the net effect of COVID increased our reported MCR by 350 basis points. Despite continuing COVID-related utilization, our year-to-date reported MCR of 87.4% was squarely in line with our long-term target range. In Marketplace, our reported third quarter MCR was 86.3%. Similar to previous quarters, the MCR was impacted by higher utilization and approximately 90 basis points of net effect of COVID. We remain on track to return our Marketplace business to profitability on a pure period basis in 2022. Though it varies by business, in aggregate, the net effect of COVID was consistent with our expectations and decreased net income by $0.59 per share in the quarter. Our full year outlook for the net effect of COVID remains unchanged at $2.50 per share. Additional drivers of our strong third quarter results include a 6.9% adjusted G&A ratio, a 40 basis point improvement over the prior year third quarter and higher net investment income from recent increases in interest rates. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and we continue to be confident in this reserve position. Days and claims payable at the end of the quarter was 50%, consistent with prior quarters. Our capital foundation remains strong. Debt at the end of the quarter was 1.7x trailing 12-month EBITDA, and our debt-to-cap ratio was 44.2%. On a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.5x and 41%, respectively. Our leverage remains low. All bond maturities are long dated on average 8 years and our weighted average cost of debt fixed at just 4%. We harvested $120 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter. Parent company cash at the end of the quarter was $298 million. With substantial incremental debt capacity, cash on hand and strong free cash flow we have ample cash and capital to drive our organic and inorganic growth strategies. Now a few comments on our updated 2022 guidance. We increased our full year premium revenue guidance by $500 million to approximately $30.5 billion, driven by 3 components: approximately $200 million for the third quarter outperformance, approximately $200 million for the addition of AgeWell, which closed October 1; and approximately $100 million to reflect the impact of the latest extension of the public health emergency through January and the related delay in resuming redeterminations, which we now expect to begin in 2023. We also raised our full year 2022 adjusted earnings guidance by $0.15 per share to at least $17.75. The increase is driven by several items. Third quarter outperformance of about $0.15 per share, margin on the additional revenue from the extension of the public health emergency, which we estimate at about $0.05 per share and additional net investment income of approximately $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter, driven by the recent rise in interest rates. Partially offsetting these items is approximately $0.15 per share of expected higher G&A, driven by fourth quarter marketing and open enrollment activities as well as the recent new contract wins. Turning now to our earnings outlook for 2023. Based on the expected timing of the known revenue building blocks, our initial outlook for 2023 premium revenue is approximately $31.5 billion. We are increasing our 2023 core EPS outlook. The earnings before the onetime nonrecurring implementation costs to at least $20.25 or 14% growth compared to our updated 2022 guidance. Our earnings growth outlook reflects several drivers. First, we expect a portion of our 2022 embedded earnings to [emerge] in 2023. Second, the attractive growth in our current footprint and the associated margin, partially offset by potential pharmacy carve-outs will yield incremental earnings in 2023. Third, a combination of new operating catalyst should enhance our 2023 earnings growth, including our recently renegotiated PBM contract, our expected real estate reduction, and finally, we expect higher interest rates to translate into correspondingly higher net investment income. Recognizing the onetime nonrecurring implementation costs of $0.75 per share on our new contract wins in California, Iowa and Nebraska, yields our updated outlook of at least $19.50 per share for 2023. Our evolving outlook for 2023 will be informed by our performance in the fourth quarter of 2022 as well as the enrollment season for Medicare and Marketplace and the ongoing execution of our strategic initiatives. As Joe mentioned, our 2023 embedded earnings power is nearly $6 per share, made up of the following components. We start with our previously reported 2022 embedded earnings of $3 per share, we add at least $3 per share of earnings from our recent new contract wins, we decreased it by $1 that is now in our 2023 outlook, and finally, we add the implementation costs for new contracts of $0.75 per share to recognize the onetime nature of IT platforms, program enhancements and several months of staff ramp-up. Now some additional color on the premium revenue outlook for 2024. The following building blocks provide a path from our expected 2022 premium revenue of approximately $30.5 billion to $31.5 billion in 2023, and to ultimately, at least $37 billion of projected revenue for 2024. First, we expect approximately $5.8 billion of premium revenue from our 3 recently announced Medicaid contract wins. This projection includes a conservative estimate of the impact from redeterminations and is composed of $3.6 billion in California, $1.6 billion in Iowa and $600 million in Nebraska. Based on contract inception dates, we expect a portion of Iowa premium revenue to emerge in 2023, while we expect the premium revenue from California and Nebraska to be realized in 2024. Second, we expect organic growth in our current footprint of $1.7 billion, consistent with underlying growth in rates and membership. Third, the incremental premium revenue for the full year impact of AgeWell and the My Choice Wisconsin acquisitions is expected to be approximately $1.4 billion, most of which will emerge in 2023. Partially offsetting these growth drivers are 2 regulatory impacts. Approximately $1.6 billion for the impact of redetermination, which we expect to emerge evenly between 2023 and 2024 based on the latest outlook for the end of the PAG in January. And approximately $700 million of pharmacy carve-outs, most of which will emerge in 2023. Of course, continued execution of our strategic initiatives creates upside to this revenue outlook. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Josh Raskin at Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin: Question I want to say on L.A. County on the win there and maybe you could speak to the preparations for that contract implementation. I'm specifically interested in network development and provider contracting and then infrastructure build-out. And I'm curious if there's a potential deal with the incumbent to help accelerate that readiness or you think you guys can do it all on your own?\nJoe Zubretsky: Josh, this is Joe. First, I would answer your second question first. All that is to be determined. As you know, in past contract wins, both here and in the industry, that is certainly a possibility, but I'll leave that to further discussion. On the preparation, we've been in California for 40 years. We know Sacramento and San Diego very well. Our membership is likely to double there. We'll scale up. And so we don't see much of a big and heavy lift for Sacramento and San Diego. Bear in mind, we are in L.A. County. We're a subcontractor to the current commercial plan. We know the providers, we know the landscape and we're really confident that with 15 months to prepare, we have the 3 things that you need to be ready on day 1. We have the time, we have the money and we have the know-how. And we will be fully ready on 1/1/24 to handle the significant new membership in LA County.\nJosh Raskin: Perfect. And then just that $0.75 then, is that a charge that you guys expect to be taking? Or is that just additional costs born through the P&L that you're calling out?\nJoe Zubretsky: Well, I think, managerially, it's a charge. I mean it's a cost that has to be incurred in advance of the revenue showing up, but we have to take it through earnings. 1/3 of it is IT scaling. The other 2/3 is staff. Take the variable cost of running $6 billion of revenue and look at having 2 to 4 months of that cost paid for trained and ready to go in advance of the contract. And you can see how easily it's going to cost $60 million pretax and $0.75 a share.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: First off, maybe you can walk us through the components of the $1.7 billion of organic growth. Maybe just price and membership growth along your 3 business lines?\nJoe Zubretsky: Justin, I'll turn it over to Mark, and he'll be able to peel that back for you.\nMark Keim: Sure. When we think about the $1.7 billion of organic growth, that was a 2-year number from our build that's looking over 2 years. Justin, we typically think of 3% to 4% organic growth on an annual basis. Generally, that's about half membership and about half rate. In a year, that's more or less. We're in a lower rate environment right now, which certainly matches trend. But you can do a little bit of math on our current book and work with those organic growth numbers. The other thing that you'd want to stack on top of this, as you think about that organic growth rate is you have to adjust for some of the pass-throughs that we have in our book right now. We've got about $500 million of pass-through revenue this year. So of course, that's going to make a year-over-year comparison less than it might otherwise look because that's not a recurring item, right? Then the only other thing to think about on organic growth is, as Joe mentioned many times on Marketplace, our Marketplace strategy is not to grow ambitiously. So I would not put a meaningful growth rate or any growth rate necessarily on Marketplace year-over-year. But I think if you add those things together, you'll get very close to the 1.7 number I talked about.\nJustin Lake: Great. And then just lastly, there's I know the folks who didn't win in California are trying to get a stay from a judge on the award and then go to court. Is there anything that you could share with us on timing on what we might hear from that? And how that might play out?\nJoe Zubretsky: No, Justin, this is Joe. We won't comment specifically on the protest process itself, but with all 3 awards. We believe that the RFPs were thoughtfully designed and well executed by the various states and that our proposals were effectively judged on their merits. We are very familiar with the protest processes in these various states and are actively engaged and well-resourced to handle it. And right now, we're heads down, preparing for day 1 implementation. We're pretty confident that many of these protest processes will not be protected and come to culmination and an answer in due course very soon.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Nathan Rich, Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: If I could ask a follow-up on the new contract wins. Could you talk about how the margins on that contract ramp up in 2024 and beyond. It looks like you're targeting about a 4% margin on that new business. Can you talk about maybe what we should expect in 2024 versus the years beyond that?\nJoe Zubretsky: First, Nathan, this is Joe. Your math is correct. The $3 sort of implies a 4 percentage point pretax margin, 3 percentage points after tax. And I will -- the first thing I'll say before kicking it to Mark, is we generally do not impute fixed cost leverage on either our acquisitions or new contract wins. So that's a fully loaded margin, fully burdened with all the fixed costs to run the business. Obviously, with $6 billion of incremental revenue, growing our Medicaid book of business [true-up] by 25% in a short span of time, we expect to get a significant amount of fixed cost leverage off these installations but we kind of hold that back. We'll report it when we realize it, and it will either drop to the bottom line or potentially offset perhaps other pressures in the [MLR]. Mark, anything more on the margins on the new wins?\nMark Keim: No, that's exactly right, Joe. The 3% is fully loaded. As we've said numerous times with fixed cost leverage, we would ideally see a few bps go to the G&A ratio. But this is conservative and assumes maybe that you give a little bit back in rate. But nevertheless, a conservative view on outlook -- now part of your question might have been 24 ramp into 25 run rate. The 3% is a conservative view of run rate. On the 24, how does that ramp up? It's interesting. Some markets, if folks are new to Medicaid, they can come in hot in the '90s for the first couple of quarters. Other markets where people have been in Medicaid and are quite used to the product and on normal utilization. They'll come in more at the normal run rate. So to be conservative, I'd say that the [MLRs] will be a little bit hotter than we aspired to. Remember, 88% to 89% is our longer-term Medicaid outlook. Would they come in a little hotter than that in the first year? Maybe. But I wouldn't think too much. And so conservatively, we say it takes a year to get to our run rate there.\nNathan Rich: Great. And if I could just ask a follow-up. You called out some continued pressure from COVID in the quarter, I think, particularly on your Medicare business. Have your expectations changed at all for COVID and maybe flu as we think about the fourth quarter and then into '23, both on the COVID front as well as non-COVID utilization, any changes there to your assumptions?\nJoe Zubretsky: No, I think our outlook for COVID remains the same. It's going to cost us $2.50 a share. And generally, what's been happening is the direct cost of COVID-related care, which have been pretty modest quarter-to-quarter have been nearly -- entirely offset by what we call COVID-related utilization suppression. And therefore, the net COVID cost has been the amount of outperformance in our Medicaid contracts that goes into the risk-sharing corridor. So our outlook on that hasn't really changed. Yes, we are expecting a normal flu season for 2022 into '23. $40 million plus is a normal flu season for us. It went to nearly 0 in the first flu season after pandemic. It's now increased to about half the normal size at about $20 million, and we expect it to go back to $40 million plus into next year, fully baked into our forecast.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Stephen Baxter of Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter: Congrats on the Medicaid wins. I think you guys mentioned in the prepared remarks, potentially this being a little bit of a lower rate environment on the Medicaid side. I was hoping you could give us a sense of how you're thinking about the outlook for rates inside of your guidance for the next couple of years. And then separately, I was hoping you could give us an update on the total amount of Medicaid premium return you expect to see in 2022, both for COVID era provisions and also for any preexisting provisions that were in the states?\nJoe Zubretsky: Stephen, I think the summary comment on the rate environment, it's continued to be stable and rational. The traditional process of establishing a credible medical cost baseline, a trend off that baseline, adjusting for changes in the acuity of the population and carve-in and carve-out benefits has been tried and true and supported this business well for decades, and that's the traditional process that is used. As we indicated many months ago, the risk-sharing corridors that were introduced during the pandemic to capture [software] utilization have generally subsided. There's 3 remaining. And we'll play it by year in terms of whether those persist into the future or not. So the rate environment is very stable, very traditional process of establishing a cost base line and a trend off that baseline. And I would say, the overall rate environment is stable. I had trouble hearing your second question, but I'll kick it to Mark. I think he has it.\nMark Keim: Yes. Just on the Medicaid revenue build, I'll work off 2024 just for the full picture. We talked about $5.8 billion from the 3 new states. The acquisitions will add $1.4 million, that's AgeWell, which is about $0.5 billion on top of this year and My Choice, which will be the full $900 coming in -- full $900 million. Other components of Medicaid revenue build redetermination across the 2 years, I see revenue headwinds of $1.6 million. And we mentioned in the prepared remarks, that would be split between the 2 years pretty evenly, we expect. Then finally, we have mentioned 2 pharmacy carve-outs that will affect our Medicaid revenue for about $700 million across the 2 years. You put your best assumption on the organic growth for Medicaid, and I think that would give you the components of the Medicaid building blocks.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice: I know you're saying that particularly for next year on the Marketplace, you're not assuming a lot of growth there. Any comment on where you think the margins will go and what your objective is there longer-term as well? Any updated thoughts?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, A.J. Our outlook for the margins of the Marketplace business is mid-single digits on a pretax basis. This year, we expect to be profitable on a pure period basis, eliminating the effects of the prior year risk adjustment true-up which we experienced in the second quarter. We break even in this business at around 84%. So if we can operate between 80% and 83%, we think we can push the business to mid-single-digit pretax margins. And I will mention 2 things. The SEP membership that we are attracting this year is far lower than the SEP membership we attracted last year. We are attracting 25,000, 30,000 a month last year, and it's barely 25,000 to 30,000 a quarter. That SEP membership, as we said last year, it usually comes in with higher acuity. So that's in check. And secondly, as a reminder, we put 13 to 14 points of rate into the market. We've looked at our competitive positioning and looking at where our product now stands against the competitors, and we're pretty confident that we've maintained our competitive position in many of our larger markets and have no reason to expect that our membership will meaningfully increase or decrease as a result of our competitive positioning.\nA.J. Rice: Okay. And then I know in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about reverification impact being spread over '23 and '24. Any updated thoughts about looking at it today. Obviously, we did have a 3-month delay on the PAG. And I don't think you guys have talked -- any updated thoughts about how much would be in '23 versus '24 and where you ultimately land. And then I don't think you've talked much about recapture with your Marketplace offering. Do you think you'll recapture any of the lost lives?\nJoe Zubretsky: On the second point, our redetermination forecast on how much revenue we will likely lose as a result of people becoming ineligible does not include a recapture on Marketplace. We're holding that as upside. It's very hard to forecast who is going to be eligible for a highly subsidized Marketplace. We believe many of them will. We have operational protocols in place to warm transfer ineligible Medicaid members over to our Marketplace business. So it remains upside to our forecast. I'll turn it to Mark to give you how the revenue emerges over a 2-year period.\nMark Keim: Yes. Just as a reminder, the most recent extension was on October -- mid-October to mid-January. We expect that the earliest states would start to redetermine then a month later in February and expect them to do it in a straight-line basis, more or less, across the year. CMS has required states to be done in 1 year, whether they can do that or not remains to be seen. But let's assume that they get there across 12 months. We're currently carrying roughly 750,000 members since the start of the pandemic. Our assumption, A.J., is that at the end of the year, we will have retained 50% of them and lost only 50% to redetermination. I model a PMPM across the book of about $3.75 on these. So when I do the math, the total revenue loss would be $1.6 billion. But remember, that's spread across 2 years. While the membership comes down this year, the revenue was half this year and half next year. If you look at the member months, so call it 0.8% this year, 0.8% next year, back to that into your revenue models. And of course, the member months will support all that.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. I just wanted to make sure I understood the $6 in earnings power fully. So I guess, first, you guys said -- I believe that you started with the $3 that you have this year at the $3 on the new business, that makes sense. But then you said if you took $1 out of the existing $3 and added back to $0.75, I just -- I don't know where that dollar that you're taking out is from? Is that from the COVID bucket from the deal bucket? How should we think about that? And then I guess we're applying this to $6 to the $19.50, I just want to make sure we have the right base to think about with the earnings power.\nJoe Zubretsky: Kevin, I'll turn it to Mark. The $0.75 charge actually creates a little bit of complex -- accounting complexity here, but it's either $5 per share or $5.75 depending on whether you're pro-forming the $19.50 or the 2025. So we're just under $6 per share at $5.75 have been better earnings when compared to the $19.50 of reported earnings for next year. Mark?\nMark Keim: Yes. So let me walk you through that. In our last call, we talked about $3 of embedded earnings. As Joe mentioned, we're increasing that by an additional $3 to recognize the run rate of the 3 new states. So we're at $6 currently. The dollar that comes down -- excuse me, we're going to put $1 into our guidance -- our outlook for next year. It's a combination of the acquisitions and the net effect of COVID. I'm expecting about $0.50 to come off the net effect of COVID that we're currently carrying. I'm expecting to realize about $1 of the acquisitions that are in our embedded earnings. And then finally, on redeterminations, $0.50 will go the other way. In my embedded earnings, I'm carrying $1 -- a negative $1 on a redetermination $0.50 of that's going to go into our outlook for next year. So you add that up, that's the dollar. Then finally, we're recognizing the $0.75 of onetime costs. So that gets you to $5.75 million to $6 a dollar for what we're putting into our outlook, increased it for $0.75 for the implementation cost that gets you to $5.75. And to be very clear, that $5.75 is off the $19.50 of adjusted earnings outlook.\nJoe Zubretsky: The other thing I would say about embedded earnings just to put a point on it, I just want to make sure we don't get to caught in what I'll call false precision here. Our embedded earnings concept, given the historic nature of the pandemic and then the incredible growth we've had due to acquisitions and new contract wins, is to give our investor base a view of the future earnings power of the business, whether it's $5 or $5.75 or $6, it's sitting on top of $19.50 or $20.25 of earnings per share in 2023 and should give you a pretty good leading indicator of where the business is headed. Now I would further say on embedded earnings. Embedded earnings is really only theoretical unless you have a history and a track record of harvesting it. And when you look at our earnings per share track record of going from $13 per share to $17 and now to $20, we -- this is not theory. This is actual embedded earnings due to timing, which is yet to be harvested, and we have every full intention of pulling that through.\nMark Keim: Joe, I'd just put a point on that. A year ago, we had more than $6 of embedded earnings and 4 of that went into current year performance. So it's quickly converting into real earnings.\nKevin Fischbeck: That's really helpful. And I guess just as far as the redetermination dynamic, we're still talking about a revenue dynamic. You guys still feel pretty comfortable that there shouldn't be any margin implications from redeterminations? And I know you shared some data in the past. Is there anything that you would point out to is kind of giving you confidence that there won't be a margin implication from a risk pool dynamic?\nJoe Zubretsky: We continue to look at the data. And we see -- we do see increased duration across our products. It's not as much as you might think because the disenrollment rate is still pretty high. Nonutilizing members are off but only up modestly and longer duration members do have more favorable [MLRs]. This really doesn't affect the ABD population because they're chronic, that's 1/3 of the revenue. And so if we do have any pressure, we're likely to see it in the expansion population, but we expect it to be minimal. Mark?\nMark Keim: That's exactly right. I studied this across the second and third quarter, it's quite in-depth. On members that are with us for longer than 1 year, of course, they're up. But as Joe mentioned, they're not up as much as you might think because the disenrollment rate is actually quite meaningful still. It's not like no one leaves. We still have meaningful disenrollment rates. So what we look at is the members with no claims, it's up a little but not that much. Some folks have also looked at the members in the 0 to 25 MLR range. That's up kind of like the no claims cohort, but not that much. When we then model through what the impacts are, as Joe mentioned, ABD really hasn't changed. That's a very stable group of folks. It's really in the expansion population that we expect to see some impact, but that's 30% of our revenues on a weighted average basis. I'm not seeing a meaningful impact here.\nKevin Fischbeck : Can I just follow up on that? Because the point about 0 utilizers, I guess, it doesn't take much of the increase your utilizers to have an increase on -- or an impact on MLR like if you had 90% MLR and then the following year, 50 basis points, more people had 0 reserve utilizers, wouldn't that take your MLR down by 50 basis points and take your Medicaid earnings up by over 10%? Like when you say there's just not a big delta in your utilizers, like what are we -- are we talking about 10 basis points? Are we talking about 100 basis points and when you say that you mean like the expansion? Or do you mean like overall across the entire book of business?\nMark Keim: In expansion, it's fairly slight. But the other thing is what are they changing to? If there are 0 utilizers now, if they go to 90%, to your point, that's a big impact. But if they're going to anything in between, obviously, the weighted average impact not so much. And again, more to the point, if it's mostly an expansion, which is 30% of our book, the impact gets greatly diluted.\nJoe Zubretsky: And of course, the underlying assumption is that even if those low utilizers, the percentage did change, the underlying assumption that is being made is those are the ones that are going to leave and there's really no evidence. We always have 0 utilizers. We always have low MLR members -- and there just is no statistically relevant data that suggests that, that's going to put pressure on the MLR.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Steven Valiquette at Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: Great. So just regarding the L.A. County Medicaid contract award. I mean, every state is a little bit different in how they handle the outcome of a successful appeal under that [indiscernible]. So I guess my question really is just around the scenario analysis, just to confirm that one way or the other. I guess is the scenario that your new award in L.A. County could be 100% completely reversed by a successful appeal by the incumbent? Or under the other scenario, does Molina stay in place as a new plan sponsor no matter what. And the incumbent would just be added back in as an additional plan sponsor over and above the existing awards and to sort of dilute the membership you would gain otherwise? Just curious to get the thoughts on that. And also for the other state awards too, if there's any just high-level color on that as well.\nJoe Zubretsky: I'll answer the last part of your question first because there was an important data point that just emerged Tuesday. And that is the one protest in Nebraska was denied on Tuesday. That's public information. So I'm not announcing anything that's private. And whether that goes through an appeal process or other administrative processes, I don't know. But that was -- that protest was denied on Tuesday. With respect to your question, I don't want to speculate. I think it would be actually inappropriate for me to speculate what the state of California, the Medicaid department and the administration would do during the protest process. I think there are ranges of scenarios of outcomes. The one we're planning for is that our award was in a well-structured thoughtfully design process. It was evaluated on its merits, and we are heads down preparing for day 1 implementation to make sure that members have access to services, providers have their questions answered, our staff is fully ramped up, and that operational excellence has been our hallmark. So I think it would be improper and perhaps even speculative for me to contemplate what the state might decide. I think there's a range of options. But right now, we think that we're going to be in business in L.A. County on 1/1/24 and getting ready to do so.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay. All right. So it sounds like it's still TBD. Okay. That's helpful.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Scott Fidel at Stephens.\nScott Fidel: I was hoping maybe you could just do a quick diagnostic for us. Just when we look at the recent success that you just had in the RFPs and really was quite substantial. And Joe, I know that sort of fixing and accelerating the RFP capability has been a key strategic priority really since you came on board. But really just sort of seem to just really hit its stride more recently. So if you had to pick 2 or 3 things that you think of just resonated in particular with the states in these recent awards, would be helpful to hear about that. And then how transferable do you think those are to somebody's big RFPs that are still ahead in Florida and Texas.\nJoe Zubretsky: Yes. Our new business development capability, it's really an apparatus. I mean it's a business unit, and there's a playbook. The playbook [indiscernible] go into the state 2 years in advance in anticipation of an RFP developing the relationships with providers, with community leaders and really getting an intense understanding of the hot buttons of the state and what particular -- what their particular concerns are with respect to their Medicaid population and their Medicaid program. Whether it's our government affairs engine, whether it is our community involvement engine, our network developers. And secondly, I would say that it's -- and our proposal writers, which we've proven that we can write high-quality proposals that are easy to understand and that score really well. But I will tell you, the key to writing a great proposal is actually being able to stand behind it and actually perform and the referenceability of our national capabilities, social determinants of health, managing high-acuity populations, opioid use disorder, substance abuse and other types of behavioral conditions, our ability to value-based contract, I mean, it's one thing to write well to innovation. It's another thing to be able to stand behind it with referenceability. And as a pure-play Medicaid player, our skills and capabilities are entirely referenceable, are playing really well and seem to be winning.\nScott Fidel: And if I could just ask one separate follow-up just back on the exchanges. And I know that you're really trying to manage the membership and keep this exposure relatively limited. But obviously, 2023 is going to be a pretty unusual year with some of these really aggressive players like Bright now exiting the market, which is going to going to put a lot of membership back sort of into the pool. So how are you approaching that? I mean we did see in the landscape data yesterday that 14% premium increase you talked about and that your premiums are pretty conservative versus the market. But you probably can still end up right with adding a lot of membership potentially. So just interested in how you're sort of thinking about that sort of incremental enrollment and then managing sort of trying to keep the business still relatively low exposure?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, Scott. And we did see that note and we thought it characterize our approach perfectly that we priced for margin and not to grow market share in this business. With respect to the market exits that you've read about, we've mapped our footprint to the companies that are exiting. There's not a lot of overlap there. Where there is, CMS has sort of \"assigned\" or at least suggested to various members that they move to a Molina product, but it's measured in the thousands, not the tens of thousands. We still don't know what the overlap is in Texas. We haven't seen the data yet. But all in all, I would say that the market exits should not have a meaningful impact on whatever our growth rate is going to be next year, the market exits should not have a meaningful impact. And yes, you're absolutely right, we priced purposely to produce mid-single-digit pretax margins, but the revenue fall work made.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Calvin Sternick at JPMorgan.\nCalvin Sternick: Sort of related on the Marketplace. I know you talked about positioning that sort of complementary to Medicaid and not really looking to grow it. But if you hold on to California, do you think you'd get maybe a natural lift in that business? Just having the overlapping Medicaid and Marketplace products in that county?\nJoe Zubretsky: Yes, Calvin. One of the things we haven't talked about yet because right now, job one is to scale up our operations in California to handle the Medicaid membership, job one. But yes, L.A. County, in particular, has a very high concentration of D-SNP members and Marketplace participants. And while we have those products in California, because of our small presence currently in L.A., I wouldn't say that we have a large LA presence in those 2 products. But yes, we would quickly evaluate whether we would -- once we're comfortable, we've got the day 1 readiness in place, fully scaled and operating well in Medicaid, we would absolutely evaluate whether our Medicare product and our Marketplace product would be -- we followed the same pattern we followed across the country, plant the Medicaid flag come in with our ancillary products and build a robust and diversified product portfolio. I would consider that upside to the growth case, but we have not included it in our current estimate.\nCalvin Sternick: And is that something that you think about as maybe being a 2024 opportunity? Or is that more 2025, just given that there is the protest, it could go to court and you have to submit your Medicare bids by middle of next year. Because what are you thinking on the timing?\nJoe Zubretsky: Well, right now, we're planning that we will be implementing our Medicaid contract on 1/1/24. That's what we're planning on. And let's assume that happens. I would say that we would not be -- we haven't valued in this yet, but I think would be pretty quick and pretty early to then be filing 2 ancillary products 6 months later until we know that we've got the Medicaid population well serviced and operating excellently. So I would say, just off the top of my head now that you've asked, it would probably be more like a '25 filing for '26, and not '24 to '25.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Dave Windley at Jefferies.\nDave Windley: Joe, I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on M&A environment in terms of opportunities, valuation expectations, then also higher cost of capital environment. a lot of organic scaling on your plate? Just what are your thoughts about continued M&A?\nJoe Zubretsky: I'm sorry, David, I couldn't hear the last end of your question, continuing to do what.\nDave Windley: What are your thoughts about continuing merger and acquisition activity for you.\nJoe Zubretsky: Thank you. Well, with all the new contract wins, we didn't spend a lot of time during this earnings report to talk about M&A. But I will tell you, the portfolio, the pipeline continues to be very robust with the same type of bolt-on tuck-in acquisitions that have been our hallmark. We're up to about $10 billion of revenue purchased. We've only allocated capital. We've only cost us about 22% of revenue, which includes regulatory capital. And we've gotten every dollar of accretion we promised and more out of these acquisitions because we turn our operational leaders and their playbook on some of these underperforming properties and we get them to target margins rather quickly. So we have ample capacity, as Mark talked about in his prepared remarks, ample debt capacity, great cash flows. We're in no way capital constraints to continue on the growth trajectory. We've had 18% to 19% growth since our pivot to growth in 2019. We promised 13% to 15% at our Investor Day. We produced close to 20%. We can continue to grow at this rate, either by acquisition or by organic or by new contract wins and continue to fund this growth from existing cash flow and debt capacity.\nMark Keim: Just to put a point on that, Dave, the pipeline is robust. At any given point, we're relationship building. We're in discussions with numerous targets out there. So I'm very encouraged by that. On a capital perspective, looking out over the next 18 months, I feel very comfortable with our capital position. Just organically, we can self-fund most of anything I see in the pipeline between the capital commitment I need for these new procurement wins as well as the capital for some of the potential M&A. I see ample organic cash flow and capital to support all that without even going outside. Now I wouldn't say I would never go outside to raise more capital. But with everything I see over the next 18 months, we can self-fund all that growth, and we're still looking at our M&A pipeline to see what else is there. So we feel pretty good about that outlook.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Michael Hua Ha of Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Hua Ha: Appreciate the question, and I appreciate all the new guidance update details. Clearly, a lot of new embedded earnings. But when I think about '23, it looks like there's potentially even more tailwinds that could drive upside to your new guidance, upside from recapturing redetermined lives in your exchange book, that's not in your guide, family glitch fix benefit potential benefit to your exchange Medicaid book if recession picked up, maybe better net investment income and rising rates. So are any of these items actually included in your new guide? Am I missing any other tailwinds that could drive upside? And on the headwinds, drive from redetermination in Florida rate cut, pharmacy carve-outs are there any large headwind buckets that should be on our radar?\nJoe Zubretsky: I think I'll take it and hand it to Mark to give you the tail take. But as we said, when you're trying to bridge from the $17.75 of earnings per share guidance for this year to the $19.50 reported for next year or 2025 core, the components are harvesting a component of embedded earnings, organic growth, which we have a great track record of harvesting, significant operational catalysts that Mark mentioned during his prepared remarks, and then, of course, we do expect a tailwind from interest rates given the short-dated nature of our portfolio. So Mark, why don't you take through the numbers?\nMark Keim: Great. As Joe mentioned, starting from $17.75, as I've mentioned, about $1 comes in from our embedded earnings. It's a little bit off the net effect of COVID. It's the M&A portion that's yet to be realized. And then it's a little bit of a headwind on redetermination in 2023. Organic growth, we talked about that, which is just the recurring growth of rates and membership. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the operational catalysts, the PBM renegotiation and the upside on that, the real estate rationalization, which I expect to address here at some point in the fourth quarter. Investment income, definitely upside on that. We manage an $8 billion portfolio today split between cash and longer-term investments. Who knows where short-term rates are going. But certainly, on the cash portion, our net investment income is very responsive to those rates. So I think some nice upside there. All those things bridge you to the 2025 core number that Joe mentioned the $0.75 gets you back to the $19.50. Michael, you addressed a bunch of the things that are potentially. We're still working through on the Marketplace, how will open enrollment work, more importantly, on redetermination. What is the cross-sell opportunity as folks come off Medicaid, maybe into Marketplace, that's all upside. We don't assume any of that in our outlook. -- you certainly hit on the net investment income upside. We continue to work through this rate environment as we go into the new year, most of our rates aren't known definitively. We work through that as we go, so that's something we're thinking about every day. But as Joe mentioned, those rates need to be tied to trend, that's an actuarial requirement. So let's see where trends in rates move. That's one thing that's still evolving in our outlook. But overall, I think you got the core components there, and you mentioned a number of the potential items on top of it.\nMichael Hua Ha: Just a quick follow-up on organic growth, if I may. Just specifically on Medicare Advantage. I think you mentioned last quarter, 7% revenue growth on both yield and membership. If I'm not mistaken, that would imply roughly low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth. But based on the landscape, it looks like you're targeting pretty strong footprint [indiscernible], doubling your accounting footprint in nondual moving entirely to 0 premium plan, raising your maximum out-of-pocket. But overall, at first [plant], it looks like your offering has improved pretty significantly. You've taken big steps and geographic expansion. So just curious, your thoughts on membership growth next year have been improved since last quarter.\nJoe Zubretsky: I think from a footprint perspective, counting the number of counties can actually give a misleading answer because we're only probably at about 50% or 60% of the Medicaid counties. However, were in counties that cover 90% of the population. So we're pretty well saturated and penetrated in the Medicaid counties, which is our strategy, follow bring D-SNP into where you're concentrated in Medicaid. Our strategy is very simply is to grow at low teens rates in Medicare. It's a low-income offering, D-SNP, we have our demonstrations, which are basically auto assignment and you roll with the auto assignment algorithms of the federal government. And then, of course, we did launch what we call traditional Medicare Advantage, but it is a low-income strategy. We're not trying to compete with the big guys who are going after affluent seniors. We're targeting people that have enough resources to operate just above the D-SNP income levels and wherewithal levels, but still need a Medicare Advantage product. So it's still a low-income niche offering, and we expect to grow, as we said at our Investor Day, at low teens rates.\nMark Keim: And just 2 things to put a point on that. The service area expansion was largely for the '22 year. For '23, we're not seeing a meaningful service area expansion. And I know you know this, when you look at our growth rates on the Medicare segment, the growth that Joe is talking about is related to the Medicare Advantage and D-SNP products. The other half -- more than half of that segment is the MMP product, which, of course, has a different growth characteristic being a close block of business. So I know you know that dynamic, but it's important to think about the 2 components of growth separately.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, our final question today comes from Joseph France with Luke Capital Markets.\nJoseph France: I just want to follow up on Scott's first question in response, which were both very helpful. Would you tell us about the scope of your subcontractor relationship with the commercial plan in Los Angeles?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure. It's -- there's one commercial plan in Los Angeles. And we are a subcontractor meaning in return for a percentage of the premium we service the members. It's under 100,000 members. But we know the environment very well. But it's a very small relationship. It's only a couple of hundred million dollars in premium, and I believe that latest count that I've seen is we're probably at around 70,000, 75,000 members in that book of business. So it gives us familiarity with the territory. Obviously, we have a big installation there with respect to headcount footprint. So we know the area very, very well. But that relationship while it gives us the familiarity that's going to help us scale up, it's financially very small.\nJoseph France: So it really had no bearing on the RFP itself.\nJoe Zubretsky: I couldn't comment whether it did or not, but I would suspect that that's correct.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session and today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Mark Keim",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss some additional details of our third quarter performance, our strong balance sheet, our updated 2022 guidance and some additional color on the revenue and EPS building blocks driving our outlooks for 2023 and 2024. Beginning with our third quarter results. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was 88.5%. This strong performance squarely in line with our long-term target range, was driven by strong medical cost management. The net effect of COVID in the quarter was a modest 10 basis points within our reported MCR. Year-to-date, our reported MCR was 88.2% and at the lower end of our long-term target range. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 88.7%, a figure which is above our long-term target range, driven by higher COVID and non-COVID utilization. During the quarter, the net effect of COVID increased our reported MCR by 350 basis points. Despite continuing COVID-related utilization, our year-to-date reported MCR of 87.4% was squarely in line with our long-term target range. In Marketplace, our reported third quarter MCR was 86.3%. Similar to previous quarters, the MCR was impacted by higher utilization and approximately 90 basis points of net effect of COVID. We remain on track to return our Marketplace business to profitability on a pure period basis in 2022. Though it varies by business, in aggregate, the net effect of COVID was consistent with our expectations and decreased net income by $0.59 per share in the quarter. Our full year outlook for the net effect of COVID remains unchanged at $2.50 per share. Additional drivers of our strong third quarter results include a 6.9% adjusted G&A ratio, a 40 basis point improvement over the prior year third quarter and higher net investment income from recent increases in interest rates. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and we continue to be confident in this reserve position. Days and claims payable at the end of the quarter was 50%, consistent with prior quarters. Our capital foundation remains strong. Debt at the end of the quarter was 1.7x trailing 12-month EBITDA, and our debt-to-cap ratio was 44.2%. On a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.5x and 41%, respectively. Our leverage remains low. All bond maturities are long dated on average 8 years and our weighted average cost of debt fixed at just 4%. We harvested $120 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter. Parent company cash at the end of the quarter was $298 million. With substantial incremental debt capacity, cash on hand and strong free cash flow we have ample cash and capital to drive our organic and inorganic growth strategies. Now a few comments on our updated 2022 guidance. We increased our full year premium revenue guidance by $500 million to approximately $30.5 billion, driven by 3 components: approximately $200 million for the third quarter outperformance, approximately $200 million for the addition of AgeWell, which closed October 1; and approximately $100 million to reflect the impact of the latest extension of the public health emergency through January and the related delay in resuming redeterminations, which we now expect to begin in 2023. We also raised our full year 2022 adjusted earnings guidance by $0.15 per share to at least $17.75. The increase is driven by several items. Third quarter outperformance of about $0.15 per share, margin on the additional revenue from the extension of the public health emergency, which we estimate at about $0.05 per share and additional net investment income of approximately $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter, driven by the recent rise in interest rates. Partially offsetting these items is approximately $0.15 per share of expected higher G&A, driven by fourth quarter marketing and open enrollment activities as well as the recent new contract wins. Turning now to our earnings outlook for 2023. Based on the expected timing of the known revenue building blocks, our initial outlook for 2023 premium revenue is approximately $31.5 billion. We are increasing our 2023 core EPS outlook. The earnings before the onetime nonrecurring implementation costs to at least $20.25 or 14% growth compared to our updated 2022 guidance. Our earnings growth outlook reflects several drivers. First, we expect a portion of our 2022 embedded earnings to [emerge] in 2023. Second, the attractive growth in our current footprint and the associated margin, partially offset by potential pharmacy carve-outs will yield incremental earnings in 2023. Third, a combination of new operating catalyst should enhance our 2023 earnings growth, including our recently renegotiated PBM contract, our expected real estate reduction, and finally, we expect higher interest rates to translate into correspondingly higher net investment income. Recognizing the onetime nonrecurring implementation costs of $0.75 per share on our new contract wins in California, Iowa and Nebraska, yields our updated outlook of at least $19.50 per share for 2023. Our evolving outlook for 2023 will be informed by our performance in the fourth quarter of 2022 as well as the enrollment season for Medicare and Marketplace and the ongoing execution of our strategic initiatives. As Joe mentioned, our 2023 embedded earnings power is nearly $6 per share, made up of the following components. We start with our previously reported 2022 embedded earnings of $3 per share, we add at least $3 per share of earnings from our recent new contract wins, we decreased it by $1 that is now in our 2023 outlook, and finally, we add the implementation costs for new contracts of $0.75 per share to recognize the onetime nature of IT platforms, program enhancements and several months of staff ramp-up. Now some additional color on the premium revenue outlook for 2024. The following building blocks provide a path from our expected 2022 premium revenue of approximately $30.5 billion to $31.5 billion in 2023, and to ultimately, at least $37 billion of projected revenue for 2024. First, we expect approximately $5.8 billion of premium revenue from our 3 recently announced Medicaid contract wins. This projection includes a conservative estimate of the impact from redeterminations and is composed of $3.6 billion in California, $1.6 billion in Iowa and $600 million in Nebraska. Based on contract inception dates, we expect a portion of Iowa premium revenue to emerge in 2023, while we expect the premium revenue from California and Nebraska to be realized in 2024. Second, we expect organic growth in our current footprint of $1.7 billion, consistent with underlying growth in rates and membership. Third, the incremental premium revenue for the full year impact of AgeWell and the My Choice Wisconsin acquisitions is expected to be approximately $1.4 billion, most of which will emerge in 2023. Partially offsetting these growth drivers are 2 regulatory impacts. Approximately $1.6 billion for the impact of redetermination, which we expect to emerge evenly between 2023 and 2024 based on the latest outlook for the end of the PAG in January. And approximately $700 million of pharmacy carve-outs, most of which will emerge in 2023. Of course, continued execution of our strategic initiatives creates upside to this revenue outlook. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Sure. When we think about the $1.7 billion of organic growth, that was a 2-year number from our build that's looking over 2 years. Justin, we typically think of 3% to 4% organic growth on an annual basis. Generally, that's about half membership and about half rate. In a year, that's more or less. We're in a lower rate environment right now, which certainly matches trend. But you can do a little bit of math on our current book and work with those organic growth numbers. The other thing that you'd want to stack on top of this, as you think about that organic growth rate is you have to adjust for some of the pass-throughs that we have in our book right now. We've got about $500 million of pass-through revenue this year. So of course, that's going to make a year-over-year comparison less than it might otherwise look because that's not a recurring item, right? Then the only other thing to think about on organic growth is, as Joe mentioned many times on Marketplace, our Marketplace strategy is not to grow ambitiously. So I would not put a meaningful growth rate or any growth rate necessarily on Marketplace year-over-year. But I think if you add those things together, you'll get very close to the 1.7 number I talked about. No, that's exactly right, Joe. The 3% is fully loaded. As we've said numerous times with fixed cost leverage, we would ideally see a few bps go to the G&A ratio. But this is conservative and assumes maybe that you give a little bit back in rate. But nevertheless, a conservative view on outlook -- now part of your question might have been 24 ramp into 25 run rate. The 3% is a conservative view of run rate. On the 24, how does that ramp up? It's interesting. Some markets, if folks are new to Medicaid, they can come in hot in the '90s for the first couple of quarters. Other markets where people have been in Medicaid and are quite used to the product and on normal utilization. They'll come in more at the normal run rate. So to be conservative, I'd say that the [MLRs] will be a little bit hotter than we aspired to. Remember, 88% to 89% is our longer-term Medicaid outlook. Would they come in a little hotter than that in the first year? Maybe. But I wouldn't think too much. And so conservatively, we say it takes a year to get to our run rate there. Yes. Just on the Medicaid revenue build, I'll work off 2024 just for the full picture. We talked about $5.8 billion from the 3 new states. The acquisitions will add $1.4 million, that's AgeWell, which is about $0.5 billion on top of this year and My Choice, which will be the full $900 coming in -- full $900 million. Other components of Medicaid revenue build redetermination across the 2 years, I see revenue headwinds of $1.6 million. And we mentioned in the prepared remarks, that would be split between the 2 years pretty evenly, we expect. Then finally, we have mentioned 2 pharmacy carve-outs that will affect our Medicaid revenue for about $700 million across the 2 years. You put your best assumption on the organic growth for Medicaid, and I think that would give you the components of the Medicaid building blocks. Yes. Just as a reminder, the most recent extension was on October -- mid-October to mid-January. We expect that the earliest states would start to redetermine then a month later in February and expect them to do it in a straight-line basis, more or less, across the year. CMS has required states to be done in 1 year, whether they can do that or not remains to be seen. But let's assume that they get there across 12 months. We're currently carrying roughly 750,000 members since the start of the pandemic. Our assumption, A.J., is that at the end of the year, we will have retained 50% of them and lost only 50% to redetermination. I model a PMPM across the book of about $3.75 on these. So when I do the math, the total revenue loss would be $1.6 billion. But remember, that's spread across 2 years. While the membership comes down this year, the revenue was half this year and half next year. If you look at the member months, so call it 0.8% this year, 0.8% next year, back to that into your revenue models. And of course, the member months will support all that. Yes. So let me walk you through that. In our last call, we talked about $3 of embedded earnings. As Joe mentioned, we're increasing that by an additional $3 to recognize the run rate of the 3 new states. So we're at $6 currently. The dollar that comes down -- excuse me, we're going to put $1 into our guidance -- our outlook for next year. It's a combination of the acquisitions and the net effect of COVID. I'm expecting about $0.50 to come off the net effect of COVID that we're currently carrying. I'm expecting to realize about $1 of the acquisitions that are in our embedded earnings. And then finally, on redeterminations, $0.50 will go the other way. In my embedded earnings, I'm carrying $1 -- a negative $1 on a redetermination $0.50 of that's going to go into our outlook for next year. So you add that up, that's the dollar. Then finally, we're recognizing the $0.75 of onetime costs. So that gets you to $5.75 million to $6 a dollar for what we're putting into our outlook, increased it for $0.75 for the implementation cost that gets you to $5.75. And to be very clear, that $5.75 is off the $19.50 of adjusted earnings outlook. Joe, I'd just put a point on that. A year ago, we had more than $6 of embedded earnings and 4 of that went into current year performance. So it's quickly converting into real earnings. That's exactly right. I studied this across the second and third quarter, it's quite in-depth. On members that are with us for longer than 1 year, of course, they're up. But as Joe mentioned, they're not up as much as you might think because the disenrollment rate is actually quite meaningful still. It's not like no one leaves. We still have meaningful disenrollment rates. So what we look at is the members with no claims, it's up a little but not that much. Some folks have also looked at the members in the 0 to 25 MLR range. That's up kind of like the no claims cohort, but not that much. When we then model through what the impacts are, as Joe mentioned, ABD really hasn't changed. That's a very stable group of folks. It's really in the expansion population that we expect to see some impact, but that's 30% of our revenues on a weighted average basis. I'm not seeing a meaningful impact here. In expansion, it's fairly slight. But the other thing is what are they changing to? If there are 0 utilizers now, if they go to 90%, to your point, that's a big impact. But if they're going to anything in between, obviously, the weighted average impact not so much. And again, more to the point, if it's mostly an expansion, which is 30% of our book, the impact gets greatly diluted. Just to put a point on that, Dave, the pipeline is robust. At any given point, we're relationship building. We're in discussions with numerous targets out there. So I'm very encouraged by that. On a capital perspective, looking out over the next 18 months, I feel very comfortable with our capital position. Just organically, we can self-fund most of anything I see in the pipeline between the capital commitment I need for these new procurement wins as well as the capital for some of the potential M&A. I see ample organic cash flow and capital to support all that without even going outside. Now I wouldn't say I would never go outside to raise more capital. But with everything I see over the next 18 months, we can self-fund all that growth, and we're still looking at our M&A pipeline to see what else is there. So we feel pretty good about that outlook. Great. As Joe mentioned, starting from $17.75, as I've mentioned, about $1 comes in from our embedded earnings. It's a little bit off the net effect of COVID. It's the M&A portion that's yet to be realized. And then it's a little bit of a headwind on redetermination in 2023. Organic growth, we talked about that, which is just the recurring growth of rates and membership. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the operational catalysts, the PBM renegotiation and the upside on that, the real estate rationalization, which I expect to address here at some point in the fourth quarter. Investment income, definitely upside on that. We manage an $8 billion portfolio today split between cash and longer-term investments. Who knows where short-term rates are going. But certainly, on the cash portion, our net investment income is very responsive to those rates. So I think some nice upside there. All those things bridge you to the 2025 core number that Joe mentioned the $0.75 gets you back to the $19.50. Michael, you addressed a bunch of the things that are potentially. We're still working through on the Marketplace, how will open enrollment work, more importantly, on redetermination. What is the cross-sell opportunity as folks come off Medicaid, maybe into Marketplace, that's all upside. We don't assume any of that in our outlook. -- you certainly hit on the net investment income upside.

But overall, I think you got the core components there, and you mentioned a number of the potential items on top of it. And just 2 things to put a point on that. The service area expansion was largely for the '22 year. For '23, we're not seeing a meaningful service area expansion. And I know you know this, when you look at our growth rates on the Medicare segment, the growth that Joe is talking about is related to the Medicare Advantage and D-SNP products. The other half -- more than half of that segment is the MMP product, which, of course, has a different growth characteristic being a close block of business. So I know you know that dynamic, but it's important to think about the 2 components of growth separately."

            "name": "Joe Zubretsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe, and good morning. Today, we will provide updates on several topics, our financial results for the third quarter of 2022, our full year 2022 guidance in the context of our third quarter results, our growth initiatives and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Our outlook on 2023 premium revenue and earnings growth and lastly, given our recent new business success and early outlook on premium revenue for 2024. Let me start with the third quarter highlights. Last night, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.36, representing 54% growth year-over-year. Our earnings growth reflects strong premium revenue growth, sustained target margins and the realization of a meaningful portion of our 2021 embedded earnings. Our third quarter 88.4% consolidated medical care ratio, 6.9% adjusted G&A ratio and 4.3% pretax margin demonstrate strong operating performance even as we navigate prolonged pandemic-related challenges. Our year-to-date performance, highlighted by an 87.9% MCR, a 6.9% adjusted G&A ratio and a 4.5% pretax margin is squarely in line with our long-term targets. This reported pretax margin increases when normalized for the effects of revenue pass-through payments and the marketplace prior year risk adjustment true-up previously reported. Medicaid, our flagship business, representing approximately 80% of enterprise revenue, continues to produce very strong and predictable operating results and cash flows. The rate environment is stable. COVID costs have tempered and we are executing on the sound fundamentals of medical cost management. The year-to-date reported MCR of 88.2% is at the lower end of our long-term target range, reflecting the underlying strength of our diversified portfolio and our focused execution. Our high acuity Medicare niche serving low-income members, representing 12% of enterprise revenue, continues to grow organically and demonstrate strong operating performance. The year-to-date reported MCR of 87.4%, even with sustained cost pressure from COVID-related care is fairly in line with our long-term target range. Marketplace, at 7% of enterprise revenue, continues to track towards a return to profitability in 2022 on a pure period basis. We have succeeded in keeping the business small, keeping it silver and keeping it stable. In summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. We executed well, delivered solid operating earnings and continued to deliver on our growth strategy. Turning now to our 2022 guidance. We now project our 2022 premium revenue to be approximately $30.5 billion or $500 million above our previous guidance. From the time of our pivot to growth in 2019, this updated 2022 revenue guidance represents a 3-year, 23% compound annual growth rate. Excluding the estimated impact of the redetermination pause, our 3-year compound annual growth rate is 19%. In addition, we have increased our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance to at least $17.75. This represents a $0.75 per share increase compared to our initial 2022 guidance despite absorbing an additional $0.50 per share from the net effect of COVID and $0.44 per share for the prior year Marketplace risk adjustment true-up. As we prepare to head into 2023, we have a very solid earnings baseline off of which to grow. Turning now to an update on our long-term strategy for sustaining profitable growth. We are executing well on the many dimensions of our growth strategy. On the RFP front, we continue to build on our track record of success in both retaining our existing Medicaid contracts and winning new ones. The quarter's highlights were many. In Mississippi, Molina was selected to continue serving Medicaid members across the entire state. In California, we've not only retained our current footprint, but we're also selected to serve the important county of Los Angeles, which will add significant membership in premium revenue. In Iowa, we were awarded a new statewide contract entering as one of 3 managed care organizations serving a total managed Medicaid population currently at 800,000. And we were awarded a new statewide contract in Nebraska as one of 3 managed care organizations serving a total managed Medicaid population currently at 360,000. Once it commences in January 2024, the California contract award is projected to provide membership growth, measured on current membership roles in excess of 1.2 million members as well as the associated significant premium revenue growth. This projection is based on the state's own published county-by-county Medicaid membership count. We were 1 of 2 plans selected in each of Sacramento County and San Diego County, which are existing Molina counties, but where we now expect additional membership in 2024. We were also selected to be the sole commercial health plan in Los Angeles County, which is a 2-plan model county. Finally, we also won awards in both San Bernardino and Riverside Counties known as the Inland Empire, where we expect our current membership levels to remain the same. With awards in each of these 5 California counties, we were successful in being selected in every county on which we bid. We are very confident in our ability to operationally prepare for this expansion. We have a deep knowledge of the [Medicare] program, and we have an existing long-term presence in Los Angeles. We have already commenced the 15-month build-out for this significant expansion. In combination, all of these contracts will expand our Medicaid portfolio to 20 states. These new contracts are expected to add approximately $5.8 billion in annual premium revenue and at least $3 of earnings per share, once we achieve full run rate margins. Looking forward, our RFP response has been submitted for [Texas STAR+PLUS]. It is pending evaluation and subsequent award announcement. We believe we are well-positioned to retain this contract due to our track record of operational and clinical excellence, standing and reputation, cutting-edge innovation and the demonstrated ability to right winning proposals. With multiple new state RFP opportunities over the coming years, we remain confident in our ability to win additional new state contracts. We have submitted our proposal for the LTSS contract in the state of Indiana, and have many other new state business development initiatives well underway, including the potential for returning to New Mexico and expanding to our former nearly statewide footprint in Florida. In summary, our track record of success validates our long-term revenue growth strategy and its value creation potential. Before I turn to some further particulars regarding our outlook for both 2023 and 2024, I want to briefly put a point on the magnitude of the company's achievements in the third quarter and what those achievements mean for the future of our company. Stated at a high level, the new business wins will have a profound impact on our company over the next few years. As a matter of year-by-year sequencing, in 2023, we will be busy scaling our proven operating infrastructure to service this new revenue, incurring front-end implementation costs. In 2024, we expect to achieve full run rate contract revenue with earnings beginning to emerge from this significant new revenue. And finally, in 2025, we expect to achieve our full run rate target margins. Against the background of this sequencing and high-level view, I will now provide some color regarding our 2023 outlook. 2023 will be an important year as we prepare for our new revenue growth. We will be hiring and training additional staff to expand our already expert teams and extending our systems to ensure ample capacity. We expect that the onetime nonrecurring expense in 2023 associated with this robust growth will be $0.75 per share. Given our strong current performance, we are raising our 2023 core earnings outlook, the earnings that would have been produced by our company before these recent wins from at least $20 per share to at least $20.25 per share. This core earnings outlook, a meaningful measure of underlying performance, represents 14% growth on today's updated 2022 guidance of at least $17.75 per share. When we include the onetime nonrecurring $0.75 per share implementation costs, our reported earnings per share outlook for 2023 is now at least $19.50. Turning now to our premium revenue outlook for 2024. While it is far too early to provide specific financial guidance for 2024, we do have line of sight to many of the premium revenue growth drivers that we expect to materialize in 2024. First, we expect to continue to grow organically in our current geographic footprint. Second, we expect our recent RFP wins in California, Iowa and Nebraska as well as our AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin acquisitions to be operating at or near full run rate revenue. And third, we expect that these growth drivers will be partially offset by the impact of redeterminations and through potential pharmacy carve-outs. Combined, these revenue building blocks create an attractive growth trajectory and path to at least $37 billion in premium revenue in 2024. With over a year to go, additional M&A announcements and new Medicaid procurement wins would add to this already attractive 2024 premium revenue picture. A few words on our embedded earnings profile, which provides a forward view of our earnings potential beyond 2023. As previously described, the $5.8 billion in incremental revenue in 2024 from our recent RFP wins adds at least $3 per share in incremental earnings. These earnings are anticipated to begin to emerge in 2024 when all of our new RFP wins will then be operational. With this $3 per share addition, our total 2023 embedded earnings power is now nearly $6 per share. This is strong latent capacity to achieve our near- and long-term earnings objectives. In summary, we are very pleased with our business performance and the exciting developments over the past few months. Combined, this has created a solid and growing financial profile, at least $20.25 per share of core earnings in 2023, $37 billion of premium revenue in 2024. 2023 embedded earnings power of nearly $6 per share and all of this is before any impact from the continued execution of our growth initiatives. Of course, we could not accomplish all of this without our excellent management team and dedicated associates, now approaching 15,000 strong, who in concert with our hallmark proprietary operating model and management process, have produced these results. To the entire team, I once again extend my deepest thanks and heartfelt appreciation. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional insight on the financials. Mark? Josh, this is Joe. First, I would answer your second question first. All that is to be determined. As you know, in past contract wins, both here and in the industry, that is certainly a possibility, but I'll leave that to further discussion. On the preparation, we've been in California for 40 years. We know Sacramento and San Diego very well. Our membership is likely to double there. We'll scale up. And so we don't see much of a big and heavy lift for Sacramento and San Diego. Bear in mind, we are in L.A. County. We're a subcontractor to the current commercial plan. We know the providers, we know the landscape and we're really confident that with 15 months to prepare, we have the 3 things that you need to be ready on day 1. We have the time, we have the money and we have the know-how. And we will be fully ready on 1/1/24 to handle the significant new membership in LA County. Well, I think, managerially, it's a charge. I mean it's a cost that has to be incurred in advance of the revenue showing up, but we have to take it through earnings. 1/3 of it is IT scaling. The other 2/3 is staff. Take the variable cost of running $6 billion of revenue and look at having 2 to 4 months of that cost paid for trained and ready to go in advance of the contract. And you can see how easily it's going to cost $60 million pretax and $0.75 a share. Justin, I'll turn it over to Mark, and he'll be able to peel that back for you. No, Justin, this is Joe. We won't comment specifically on the protest process itself, but with all 3 awards. We believe that the RFPs were thoughtfully designed and well executed by the various states and that our proposals were effectively judged on their merits. We are very familiar with the protest processes in these various states and are actively engaged and well-resourced to handle it. And right now, we're heads down, preparing for day 1 implementation. We're pretty confident that many of these protest processes will not be protected and come to culmination and an answer in due course very soon. First, Nathan, this is Joe. Your math is correct. The $3 sort of implies a 4 percentage point pretax margin, 3 percentage points after tax. And I will -- the first thing I'll say before kicking it to Mark, is we generally do not impute fixed cost leverage on either our acquisitions or new contract wins. So that's a fully loaded margin, fully burdened with all the fixed costs to run the business. Obviously, with $6 billion of incremental revenue, growing our Medicaid book of business [true-up] by 25% in a short span of time, we expect to get a significant amount of fixed cost leverage off these installations but we kind of hold that back. We'll report it when we realize it, and it will either drop to the bottom line or potentially offset perhaps other pressures in the [MLR]. Mark, anything more on the margins on the new wins? No, I think our outlook for COVID remains the same. It's going to cost us $2.50 a share. And generally, what's been happening is the direct cost of COVID-related care, which have been pretty modest quarter-to-quarter have been nearly -- entirely offset by what we call COVID-related utilization suppression. And therefore, the net COVID cost has been the amount of outperformance in our Medicaid contracts that goes into the risk-sharing corridor. So our outlook on that hasn't really changed. Yes, we are expecting a normal flu season for 2022 into '23. $40 million plus is a normal flu season for us. It went to nearly 0 in the first flu season after pandemic. It's now increased to about half the normal size at about $20 million, and we expect it to go back to $40 million plus into next year, fully baked into our forecast. Stephen, I think the summary comment on the rate environment, it's continued to be stable and rational. The traditional process of establishing a credible medical cost baseline, a trend off that baseline, adjusting for changes in the acuity of the population and carve-in and carve-out benefits has been tried and true and supported this business well for decades, and that's the traditional process that is used. As we indicated many months ago, the risk-sharing corridors that were introduced during the pandemic to capture [software] utilization have generally subsided. There's 3 remaining. And we'll play it by year in terms of whether those persist into the future or not. So the rate environment is very stable, very traditional process of establishing a cost base line and a trend off that baseline. And I would say, the overall rate environment is stable. I had trouble hearing your second question, but I'll kick it to Mark. I think he has it. Sure, A.J. Our outlook for the margins of the Marketplace business is mid-single digits on a pretax basis. This year, we expect to be profitable on a pure period basis, eliminating the effects of the prior year risk adjustment true-up which we experienced in the second quarter. We break even in this business at around 84%. So if we can operate between 80% and 83%, we think we can push the business to mid-single-digit pretax margins. And I will mention 2 things. The SEP membership that we are attracting this year is far lower than the SEP membership we attracted last year. We are attracting 25,000, 30,000 a month last year, and it's barely 25,000 to 30,000 a quarter. That SEP membership, as we said last year, it usually comes in with higher acuity. So that's in check. And secondly, as a reminder, we put 13 to 14 points of rate into the market. We've looked at our competitive positioning and looking at where our product now stands against the competitors, and we're pretty confident that we've maintained our competitive position in many of our larger markets and have no reason to expect that our membership will meaningfully increase or decrease as a result of our competitive positioning. On the second point, our redetermination forecast on how much revenue we will likely lose as a result of people becoming ineligible does not include a recapture on Marketplace. We're holding that as upside. It's very hard to forecast who is going to be eligible for a highly subsidized Marketplace. We believe many of them will. We have operational protocols in place to warm transfer ineligible Medicaid members over to our Marketplace business. So it remains upside to our forecast. I'll turn it to Mark to give you how the revenue emerges over a 2-year period. Kevin, I'll turn it to Mark. The $0.75 charge actually creates a little bit of complex -- accounting complexity here, but it's either $5 per share or $5.75 depending on whether you're pro-forming the $19.50 or the 2025. So we're just under $6 per share at $5.75 have been better earnings when compared to the $19.50 of reported earnings for next year. Mark? The other thing I would say about embedded earnings just to put a point on it, I just want to make sure we don't get to caught in what I'll call false precision here. Our embedded earnings concept, given the historic nature of the pandemic and then the incredible growth we've had due to acquisitions and new contract wins, is to give our investor base a view of the future earnings power of the business, whether it's $5 or $5.75 or $6, it's sitting on top of $19.50 or $20.25 of earnings per share in 2023 and should give you a pretty good leading indicator of where the business is headed. Now I would further say on embedded earnings. Embedded earnings is really only theoretical unless you have a history and a track record of harvesting it. And when you look at our earnings per share track record of going from $13 per share to $17 and now to $20, we -- this is not theory. This is actual embedded earnings due to timing, which is yet to be harvested, and we have every full intention of pulling that through. We continue to look at the data. And we see -- we do see increased duration across our products. It's not as much as you might think because the disenrollment rate is still pretty high. Nonutilizing members are off but only up modestly and longer duration members do have more favorable [MLRs]. This really doesn't affect the ABD population because they're chronic, that's 1/3 of the revenue. And so if we do have any pressure, we're likely to see it in the expansion population, but we expect it to be minimal. Mark? And of course, the underlying assumption is that even if those low utilizers, the percentage did change, the underlying assumption that is being made is those are the ones that are going to leave and there's really no evidence. We always have 0 utilizers. We always have low MLR members -- and there just is no statistically relevant data that suggests that, that's going to put pressure on the MLR. I'll answer the last part of your question first because there was an important data point that just emerged Tuesday. And that is the one protest in Nebraska was denied on Tuesday. That's public information. So I'm not announcing anything that's private. And whether that goes through an appeal process or other administrative processes, I don't know. But that was -- that protest was denied on Tuesday. With respect to your question, I don't want to speculate. I think it would be actually inappropriate for me to speculate what the state of California, the Medicaid department and the administration would do during the protest process. I think there are ranges of scenarios of outcomes. The one we're planning for is that our award was in a well-structured thoughtfully design process. It was evaluated on its merits, and we are heads down preparing for day 1 implementation to make sure that members have access to services, providers have their questions answered, our staff is fully ramped up, and that operational excellence has been our hallmark. So I think it would be improper and perhaps even speculative for me to contemplate what the state might decide. I think there's a range of options. But right now, we think that we're going to be in business in L.A. County on 1/1/24 and getting ready to do so. Yes. Our new business development capability, it's really an apparatus. I mean it's a business unit, and there's a playbook. The playbook [indiscernible] go into the state 2 years in advance in anticipation of an RFP developing the relationships with providers, with community leaders and really getting an intense understanding of the hot buttons of the state and what particular -- what their particular concerns are with respect to their Medicaid population and their Medicaid program. Whether it's our government affairs engine, whether it is our community involvement engine, our network developers. And secondly, I would say that it's -- and our proposal writers, which we've proven that we can write high-quality proposals that are easy to understand and that score really well. But I will tell you, the key to writing a great proposal is actually being able to stand behind it and actually perform and the referenceability of our national capabilities, social determinants of health, managing high-acuity populations, opioid use disorder, substance abuse and other types of behavioral conditions, our ability to value-based contract, I mean, it's one thing to write well to innovation. It's another thing to be able to stand behind it with referenceability. And as a pure-play Medicaid player, our skills and capabilities are entirely referenceable, are playing really well and seem to be winning. Sure, Scott. And we did see that note and we thought it characterize our approach perfectly that we priced for margin and not to grow market share in this business. With respect to the market exits that you've read about, we've mapped our footprint to the companies that are exiting. There's not a lot of overlap there. Where there is, CMS has sort of \"assigned\" or at least suggested to various members that they move to a Molina product, but it's measured in the thousands, not the tens of thousands. We still don't know what the overlap is in Texas. We haven't seen the data yet. But all in all, I would say that the market exits should not have a meaningful impact on whatever our growth rate is going to be next year, the market exits should not have a meaningful impact. And yes, you're absolutely right, we priced purposely to produce mid-single-digit pretax margins, but the revenue fall work made. Yes, Calvin. One of the things we haven't talked about yet because right now, job one is to scale up our operations in California to handle the Medicaid membership, job one. But yes, L.A. County, in particular, has a very high concentration of D-SNP members and Marketplace participants. And while we have those products in California, because of our small presence currently in L.A., I wouldn't say that we have a large LA presence in those 2 products. But yes, we would quickly evaluate whether we would -- once we're comfortable, we've got the day 1 readiness in place, fully scaled and operating well in Medicaid, we would absolutely evaluate whether our Medicare product and our Marketplace product would be -- we followed the same pattern we followed across the country, plant the Medicaid flag come in with our ancillary products and build a robust and diversified product portfolio. I would consider that upside to the growth case, but we have not included it in our current estimate. Well, right now, we're planning that we will be implementing our Medicaid contract on 1/1/24. That's what we're planning on. And let's assume that happens. I would say that we would not be -- we haven't valued in this yet, but I think would be pretty quick and pretty early to then be filing 2 ancillary products 6 months later until we know that we've got the Medicaid population well serviced and operating excellently. So I would say, just off the top of my head now that you've asked, it would probably be more like a '25 filing for '26, and not '24 to '25. I'm sorry, David, I couldn't hear the last end of your question, continuing to do what. Thank you. Well, with all the new contract wins, we didn't spend a lot of time during this earnings report to talk about M&A. But I will tell you, the portfolio, the pipeline continues to be very robust with the same type of bolt-on tuck-in acquisitions that have been our hallmark. We're up to about $10 billion of revenue purchased. We've only allocated capital. We've only cost us about 22% of revenue, which includes regulatory capital. And we've gotten every dollar of accretion we promised and more out of these acquisitions because we turn our operational leaders and their playbook on some of these underperforming properties and we get them to target margins rather quickly. So we have ample capacity, as Mark talked about in his prepared remarks, ample debt capacity, great cash flows. We're in no way capital constraints to continue on the growth trajectory. We've had 18% to 19% growth since our pivot to growth in 2019. We promised 13% to 15% at our Investor Day. We produced close to 20%. We can continue to grow at this rate, either by acquisition or by organic or by new contract wins and continue to fund this growth from existing cash flow and debt capacity. I think I'll take it and hand it to Mark to give you the tail take. But as we said, when you're trying to bridge from the $17.75 of earnings per share guidance for this year to the $19.50 reported for next year or 2025 core, the components are harvesting a component of embedded earnings, organic growth, which we have a great track record of harvesting, significant operational catalysts that Mark mentioned during his prepared remarks, and then, of course, we do expect a tailwind from interest rates given the short-dated nature of our portfolio. So Mark, why don't you take through the numbers? I think from a footprint perspective, counting the number of counties can actually give a misleading answer because we're only probably at about 50% or 60% of the Medicaid counties. However, were in counties that cover 90% of the population. So we're pretty well saturated and penetrated in the Medicaid counties, which is our strategy, follow bring D-SNP into where you're concentrated in Medicaid. Our strategy is very simply is to grow at low teens rates in Medicare. It's a low-income offering, D-SNP, we have our demonstrations, which are basically auto assignment and you roll with the auto assignment algorithms of the federal government. And then, of course, we did launch what we call traditional Medicare Advantage, but it is a low-income strategy. We're not trying to compete with the big guys who are going after affluent seniors. We're targeting people that have enough resources to operate just above the D-SNP income levels and wherewithal levels, but still need a Medicare Advantage product. So it's still a low-income niche offering, and we expect to grow, as we said at our Investor Day, at low teens rates. Sure. It's -- there's one commercial plan in Los Angeles. And we are a subcontractor meaning in return for a percentage of the premium we service the members. It's under 100,000 members. But we know the environment very well. But it's a very small relationship. It's only a couple of hundred million dollars in premium, and I believe that latest count that I've seen is we're probably at around 70,000, 75,000 members in that book of business. So it gives us familiarity with the territory. Obviously, we have a big installation there with respect to headcount footprint. So we know the area very, very well. But that relationship while it gives us the familiarity that's going to help us scale up, it's financially very small. I couldn't comment whether it did or not, but I would suspect that that's correct."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJoe Krocheski: Good morning and welcome to Molina Healthcare\u2019s second quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina\u2019s President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our second quarter earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made are as of today, Thursday, July 28, 2022 and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our second quarter 2022 press release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2022 guidance, our 2023 outlook, our growth strategy and expected growth, our RFP submissions, the COVID-19 pandemic, our acquisitions, our future margins and embedded earnings power and our long-term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?\nJoe Zubretsky: Thank you, Joe and good morning. Today, we will provide updates on several topics: our financial results for the second quarter 2022, our full year 2022 guidance in the context of our second quarter results, our growth initiatives and the reaffirmation of our strategy for sustaining profitable growth, and an early outlook on 2023 premium revenue and earnings growth. Let me start with the second quarter highlights. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.55 for the second quarter, with adjusted net income of $266 million on $7.8 billion of premium revenue. Second quarter adjusted earnings were decreased by $0.44 per share for a true-up to our 2021 final Marketplace risk adjustment transfer payments. Excluding this out-of-period item, our adjusted earnings per share was $4.99. Our 88.1% total company MCR in the second quarter demonstrates strong operating performance even as we navigate prolonged pandemic-related challenges. As Mark will describe later, the reported MCR included increases related to the 2021 Marketplace risk adjustment true-up and the accounting impact of a revenue pass-through. As such, our underlying pure-period MCR was 87.2%. Similarly our reported pre-tax margin of 4.4% increases to 5%, which is at the top end of our long-term target range. For the quarter, we produced 18% premium revenue growth and 34% earnings per share growth. Our year-to-date performance highlighted by an 87.6% MCR, a 6.9% adjusted G&A ratio and a 4.7% pre-tax margin is squarely in line with our long-term targets. Adjusting for the Marketplace risk adjustment true-up and the accounting impact of the revenue pass-through, our underlying pure-period year-to-date MCR was 87.2%. Year-to-date, we produced 19% premium revenue growth and 21% adjusted earnings per share growth. Medicaid, our flagship business, representing 80% of enterprise revenue, continues to produce a very strong and predictable operating results and cash flows. The rate environment is stable, COVID costs have tempered and we are executing on the sound fundamentals of medical cost management. The ongoing and consistent high earnings quality in the first 6 months produced at reported MCR of 88.1%. Our diversified geographic footprint and mix of products, including management of high acuity members, provides us with an excellent earnings ballast. Our high acuity Medicare niche serving low-income members, representing 13% of enterprise revenue, continues to grow organically and outperform our long-term target margins. The year-to-date reported MCR of 86.7%, even while still pressured by the cost of COVID-related care, is below the low end of our long-term target range. Each of our products, D-SNP, MAPD, WEDI/SNIP and MMP, contributed to this favorable result. Marketplace at 7% of enterprise revenue is tracking to return to profitability in 2022 on a pure-period basis. We have succeeded in keeping the business small, keeping it silver and keeping it stable. The true-up to 2021 risk adjustment is largely due to the surge of special enrollment period membership that we experienced in the last half of 2021. On a pure-period basis, 2022 is on track to achieve a low single-digit pre-tax margin. In summary, we are very pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date performance. We executed well, delivered solid operating earnings and continued to deliver on our growth strategy. Turning now to our 2022 guidance, we now project premium revenue to be approximately $30 billion or $750 million above our previous guidance. Our updated 2022 guidance represents a 3-year 23% compound annual growth rate since our pivot to growth in 2019. Excluding the estimated impact of the redetermination pause, our 3-year compound annual growth rate is 18%. We are also increasing our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance to at least $17.60. Our increased 2022 outlook features strong premium revenue growth of 12%, which includes the impact of our conscious decision to reset the size and scope of our Marketplace business, a pre-tax margin at the midpoint of our long-term guidance range, and strong earnings per share growth of 30%. We have purposely remained conservative in our full year 2022 earnings guidance. Our year-to-date underlying performance is highlighted by effective management of medical costs, both COVID and non-COVID, that were favorable to our expectations. In this environment, which is still being affected by the emergence of new COVID variants, it is prudent to remain cautious in forecasting medical cost trends. In the first half of the year, for Medicaid and Medicare, which account for 93% of enterprise revenues, we produced MCRs at or below the low-end of our target ranges. We believe it is prudent to project MCRs to be within the target range for the second half of the year. Bear in mind that our target MCR ranges result in industry leading margins. With that being said, if we were to repeat our first half performance with respect to medical cost management in the second half, then it is highly likely we would outperform this full year earnings guidance. Turning now to an update on our long-term strategy for sustaining profitable growth. We remain confident that we will deliver on our long-term growth targets of 13% to 15% premium revenue growth and 15% to 18% adjusted earnings per share growth on average over time and sustained 4% to 5% pre-tax margins. Our recent performance is supportive of that outlook. Our model for organic growth remains sound. In Medicaid, our market share is high enough to be relevant to our state-based partners and gives us sufficient scale, but low enough to provide an environment for market share gains. Although it has been difficult to measure during the pandemic, we have grown market share in many of our states. The political landscape remains focused on reducing the uninsured population favoring government-sponsored programs and driving underlying growth in our current footprint. The economy has had a significant impact on the low-wage service sector as well. We continue to believe the post-pandemic Medicaid roles will be higher than pre-pandemic levels. On the RFP front, our past track record gives us confidence in successfully retaining the Medicaid contracts that are currently in a reprocurement process. Our RFP responses have been submitted in Mississippi, California and for Texas Star+ in our pending evaluation and subsequent award announcement. We are well positioned to retain these contracts due to our track record of operational and clinical excellence, standing and reputation, innovation and the demonstrated ability to write winning proposals. With multiple new RFP opportunities over the coming years, we remain confident in our ability to win additional new state contracts. We submitted our proposals in the states of Iowa and Nebraska and have many other new state business development initiatives well underway. In Medicare, the rate environment and demographic trends remain supportive of sustainable growth. Additionally, we have opportunities to further penetrate our Medicaid footprint in both D-SNP and low-income MAPD products. Our three distribution channels have achieved a high degree of productivity and have lowered our cost of acquisition. Consequently, we are investing heavily in these channels. In Marketplace, our focus is on keeping it small in the context of the overall portfolio and pricing with a goal of achieving mid single-digit pre-tax margins. As a result, we will grow this business only as allowed by this pricing strategy. Moving now to our inorganic growth strategy, our M&A platform continues to execute at a high level. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of My Choice Wisconsin\u2019s MLTSS and core Medicaid assets for an attractive purchase price of approximately 15% of revenue. This acquisition is highly complementary to our expanding Wisconsin Medicaid footprint and our growing MLTSS business. My Choice Wisconsin serves over 44,000 members and generates premium revenue of approximately $1 billion. We expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to adjusted earnings and deliver first year adjusted EPS of $0.15 and $0.45 at full run-rate. In addition to being perfectly consistent with our product and geographic growth strategy, the acquisition of My Choice Wisconsin validates the vibrancy and actionability of our expansive M&A opportunity pipeline. With the addition of My Choice Wisconsin, our enterprise MLTSS business will be attached to over $9 billion in premium revenue and over $6 billion of LTSS benefits paid. Over the past 10 months, between AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin, we have announced nearly $2 billion in acquired revenue, which will be included in our 2023 premium revenue based on the expected timing of closing both transactions. We have now announced 7 acquisitions since we embarked on our growth strategy. The 5 already closed are achieving or exceeding their earnings accretion target. Given our track record and a pipeline replete with actionable and strategically focused acquisition opportunities, we are confident in our ability to continue to execute on this important dimension of our growth strategy. In summary, the company\u2019s financial and operational performance validates our long-term revenue growth strategy and its value creation potential. Turning now to our initial outlook for 2023, while it is far too early to provide specific 2023 financial guidance, I will offer a view of some of the building blocks of our initial outlook for 2023. First, with respect to 2023 revenue, we continue to build the 2023 book of business throughout this year. At this early stage, we have line of sight to nearly 10% growth in 2023 from our strategic initiatives and an early estimate of organic growth. This growth will be partially offset by the impact of redeterminations, which we have spoken about at length and one or two potential pharmacy carve-outs, the timing and extent of which are uncertain. We are only halfway through 2022, and therefore, additional M&A announcements and new Medicaid procurement wins would add to the 2023 revenue picture. Now turning to 2023 earnings. First, in 2022, we are carrying approximately $3 per share of embedded earnings power, which we expect to be realized in 2023 and beyond. This estimate, which has been updated since last quarter, comprises net effect of COVID and full accretion on M&A earnings, offset by redetermination impacts. Second, we expect the core book of business will grow organically. As we have demonstrated in the past, when we grow organically, we achieve our target margins. Third, in the quarter, we have finalized or significantly progressed on some major initiatives, which provide earnings upside, two of which are noteworthy. We recently renegotiated and executed a new PBM contract with CVS Caremark, which extends the existing contract term at substantially more favorable pricing. Since pharmacy accounts for 15% to 20% of our medical cost baseline, the improved rate structure will substantially improve our pharmacy economics and resulting medical cost trend. The CVS Caremark relationship has been essential to our delivery of excellent pharmacy service to our customers and members and has enabled strong cost control. We are very pleased to have extended this relationship. And secondly, we intend to move permanently to a remote work environment, a model we have been working under successfully for nearly 2 years. As a result, by the end of this year, we expect to formalize a reduction of our real estate footprint by approximately two-thirds, yielding substantial and sustainable G&A savings. These building blocks aggregate to a very attractive earnings trajectory for 2023 and beyond, although the timing of emergence for each of these is still evolving. That being said, with 2022 adjusted earnings guidance of at least $17.60 per share, embedded earnings power of $3 per share, the earnings contribution of organic growth and the operational catalysts we just mentioned, we fully expect our 2023 adjusted earnings to be at least $20 per share. Although it is too early in the cycle to provide specific earnings guidance for 2023, we are very confident in this earnings outlook. We will certainly update this outlook as it evolves, informed by our performance in the second half of 2022 and the ongoing execution of our strategic initiatives. In conclusion, in the second quarter, we performed very well across the enterprise. Our 2022 earnings base [Technical Difficulty], our growth strategy is working and our early outlook for 2023 is strong. We are executing on our long-term strategic plan and delivering results accordingly. Of course, we could not do this without our excellent management team and dedicated associates, now approaching 15,000 strong. We have produced these results under the difficult and rapidly changing circumstances of the pandemic. To the entire team, I once again extend my deepest thanks and heartfelt appreciation. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark?\nMark Keim: Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss some additional details of our second quarter performance, our strong balance sheet, our updated guidance for 2022 and some initial views on the building blocks of our 2023 outlook. Beginning with our second quarter results. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was 88%. Normalizing for approximately $350 million of pass-through payments in our Texas plan, our reported MCR improves to 87.4%. This strong performance, better than the low end of our long-term target range, was driven by strong medical cost management and lower utilization. The net effect of COVID in the quarter was a modest 20 basis point increase to our reported MCR. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 86.9%, also better than the low end of our long-term target range. During the quarter, the net effect of COVID increased our reported MCR by 370 basis points as BA-5 and other variants resulted in increase in patient expense. This pressure was more than offset by favorable risk adjustment and strong medical cost management. In Marketplace, our reported second quarter MCR of 91.2% was inflated by a final true-up of 2021 risk adjustment transfer payments. Normalizing for this out-of-period item, our second quarter MCR was 85.7%. Recall, our Marketplace business was more than twice the size last year, so the prior year settlement had a disproportionate impact on the current year. Second quarter pure-period results were impacted by higher utilization due to the carryover effects of 2021 special enrollment period membership and approximately 50 basis points of net effect of COVID. We remain on track to return our Marketplace business to profitability on a pure-period basis in 2022. In aggregate, the net effect of COVID was consistent with our expectations and decreased net income by $0.68 per share in the quarter. The full year outlook for the net effect of COVID remains at $2.50 per share. Putting it all together, with the two adjustments I described, our reported second quarter MCR for the consolidated company of 88.1% improved to 87.2%. Similarly, our reported pretax margin of 4.4% increases to 5%. And the reported G&A ratio of 6.8% restates to 7%. We continue to expect our full year 2022 G&A ratio to be consistent with our long-term target, reflecting fixed cost leverage on our growth and ongoing discipline. Our results as reported and normalized, displayed the strong performance of our second quarter and the continuing earnings power of the business. Turning now to our balance sheet, our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and we remain confident in this reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter, normalized for pass-through payments, which inflate DCP, was 50.4% consistent with prior quarters. Our capital foundation remained strong. Debt at the end of the quarter was 1.9x trailing 12-month EBITDA, and our debt-to-cap ratio was 45.9%. On a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.7x and 43.7%, respectively. Our leverage remains low. All bond maturities are long-dated, on average 8 years, and our weighted average cost of debt is just 4%. We harvested $165 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, and we purchased approximately 660,000 of our shares for approximately $200 million. Parent company cash at the end of the quarter was $210 million. With substantial incremental debt capacity, cash on hand and strong free cash flow we have ample cash and capital to drive our organic and inorganic growth strategies. Now a few comments on our 2022 guidance. We have increased our full year premium revenue guidance by $750 million to approximately $30 billion, driven by two components: approximately $250 million, reflecting the latest extension of the public health emergency and the related delay in resuming a redetermination of Medicaid eligibility and approximately $500 million for the second quarter outperformance and some additional Texas pass-through revenue. We also raised our full year 2022 adjusted earnings guidance by $0.50 per share to at least $17.60. The increase is driven by three items: second quarter performance above our expectations by about $0.25 per share, margin on the additional revenue from the extension of the public health emergency, which we estimate at about $0.15 per share; an additional net income of $0.10 per share in the second half, driven by the recent rise in interest rates. Normalizing for the out-of-period risk adjustment item of $0.44 per share, our second quarter outperformance increases to about $0.70 per share. We have offset any extrapolation of this second quarter outperformance for the rest of the year with some tempered conservatism. Our first half MCRs outperformed the lower end of our long-term target ranges in both Medicaid and Medicare. In the second half, we are projecting those same ratios to be more in line with our long-term target ranges. As Joe mentioned, our updated guidance will prove conservative if the strong medical cost management and lower utilization we saw in the first half continues through the rest of the year. We expect second half earnings to be distributed fairly evenly between the third and fourth quarters. Finally, some additional color on the building blocks of our initial outlook for 2023. Beginning with premium revenue, our initial outlook is for the announced pending acquisitions of AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin and organic growth to drive approximately 10% growth of our current 2022 premium revenue guidance. We expect this growth to be partially offset by redeterminations and potential pharmacy carve-out. Our 2023 revenue outlook will continue to evolve as we make progress on our in-flight strategic initiatives, including acquisitions and procurement. Turning to adjusted earnings, first, our embedded earnings power is now approximately $3 per share, comprising $2.50 net effect of COVID, $1.50 from our closed and pending acquisitions went at target margin, offset by approximately $1 from the eventual impact of redeterminations. While it\u2019s too early to guide on the emergence of these components, we offer some perspectives on what might impact 2023. Within the $2.50 net effect of COVID, corridors in just three states are the primary driver. We expect to see upside here as states terminate these corridors as Ohio already has and the lingering cost of COVID and patient services dissipates to a new normal. Our acquisitions typically reach target margin in the second year of operations. We feel confident we will see a significant portion of the $1.50 emerge in 2023 as Affinity and Cigna Texas will be in their second year and AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin will make their first-year contributions. We now assume redetermination will begin in October, and we expect to lose approximately half of the 750,000 members we gained since the start of the pandemic. These membership attrition assumptions yield a 2023 headwind of $1.2 billion in revenue and $0.70 per share on EPS. Several highly credible data points give us confidence that the margin on members lost through redetermination, have a similar profile to our overall membership. Second, the attractive growth of our legacy business and the associated margin, partially offset by potential pharmacy carve-outs will yield incremental earnings in 2023. Third, as Joe described, we see a combination of new operating drivers that should enhance our 2023 earnings growth, including our recently renegotiated PBM contract, which improves the economics on 15% to 20% of our total medical cost spend and our expected real estate reduction. We plan to reduce the roughly 2 million square feet of leased office space by approximately two-thirds by the end of the year. Finally, we expect higher interest rates to translate into correspondingly higher net investment income. These building blocks provide an early view of some of the most impactful components of our outlook for next year. Our evolving outlook on 2023 will be informed by our performance in the second half of 2022 as well as the ongoing execution of our strategic initiatives. We now feel confident in setting our initial outlook for 2023 adjusted EPS to at least $20. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just a question on the risk payable or risk transfer payable update, was that more your membership came in healthier than expected? You had codes rejected or something or was it the market was overall sicker? And how does that inform your pricing and thoughts around the opportunities for growth next year in the exchanges?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, Josh. Really, it was a function of the surge of special enrollment membership we experienced last year. If you recall, we took on 250,000 members between March and the end of the year. And of course, we had to really gear up and scale up to service that membership, including risk adjustment. So I think part of it was keeping pace with the surge of membership and getting the risk scores. I think part of it was the acuity of the membership. And I think another part of it was just the imprecise nature of actuarial estimations given that unstable environment. The good news for this year is we became aware of this emerging trend early in the quarter as we were developing our final pricing in the Marketplace, and we\u2019re able to take the current view of the acuity of this population into consideration as we filed our final prices for 2023.\nJosh Raskin: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matthew, perhaps your line is muted.\nMatthew Borsch: Sorry. Can you hear me?\nJoe Zubretsky: Yes, we can.\nMatthew Borsch: Okay. I apologize, having a new phone here. So I was just going to ask about another item in the quarter, which is the prior year reserve development. Looked like you got a little over $100 million, I mean I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a net benefit, obviously, because you\u2019re replenishing reserves. But can you just comment on that because I think in the year ago period, it was pretty much zero?\nMark Keim: Yes, sure. Matt, good morning. It\u2019s Mark. I think you\u2019re looking at the year-over-year change. We had a little more prior year development this second quarter than we did a year ago at this time. And that\u2019s not unusual. The way development happens is not always the same year-over-year. The way our providers submit claims and the way our internal operations, including payment integrity work is a little different year-over-year. So yes, the pattern is a little bit different. But what\u2019s more important is I\u2019m reporting our DCP at 50.4%, which versus a year ago at 48% is clearly up. The other thing that you guys look at a lot of times is just the growth in premium versus the growth in reserves. My reserves are up 28% year over my premiums are up 18%. So I feel really good about where I\u2019m reserved. I think we\u2019re in a good spot.\nMatthew Borsch: Okay. Fantastic, thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: Hi, thanks for the question. It was interesting here you talked about the several highly credible data points suggesting the decremental margin on the lost Medicaid redetermination membership would be in line with the portfolio average. Obviously, this is an area of concern or uncertainty for the market. So would love if you could maybe help us understand what you\u2019re looking at to better understand this issue and reach that conclusion. Thank you.\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, Stephen. I\u2019ll kick it to Mark for some of the actual numbers. But as a matter of routine in the Medicaid business, one needs to understand the duration of its membership. Duration could have an impact on the acuity of a population. So it\u2019s something we routinely look at. I will tell you that during the pandemic, the duration of membership, the length of time people are on the Medicaid rolls didn\u2019t extend all that much. And I will tell you that the differences in acuity as measured by medical care ratios is not that much different on short duration members versus long duration members. We have lots of other actuarial and medical economics data points that suggest that the members that will leave, will leave at portfolio averages. But I\u2019ll turn it to Mark for a little more color on that.\nMark Keim: Sure. Just a couple of data points that we track really closely. Remember, within our Medicaid business, there is a TANF chip, there is expansion and there is ABD. So we look at these within each of those. One of the first things we look is the duration, what percentage of our members are with us for more than a year. In TANF chip, it really didn\u2019t change meaningfully. ABD didn\u2019t really change meaningfully. Expansion is up a little, not huge. Within those populations, though, we also then compare what\u2019s the MCR for the folks that are maybe 2 years and longer with us versus the MCR for those less than a year. That\u2019s the durational acuity concept that Joe mentioned. It\u2019s really flat between those two cohorts in TANF chip. It\u2019s pretty flat on ABD. It\u2019s a really stable population. So it\u2019s up a little in expansion. On the percentage of members with no claims, another one that\u2019s good to look at. TANF chip pretty flat, ABD, once again flat. We\u2019re seeing a little bit more in expansion. So could you argue that there is going to be a little bit of pressure within expansion? Possibly, but at third of the overall Medicaid book, any impact there gets diluted. So we really don\u2019t see this as a big headwind.\nOperator: The next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Maybe just continuing to look \u2013 triangulate around the reverification question, so when you\u2019re giving those numbers for next year, are you assuming the full impact of the reverification plays out next year? I know some of your peers have talked about states taking as much as 10 months to gear back up fully, and therefore, you would sort of have a partial impact next year and the full impact annualized in 2024. Can you \u2013 those numbers you threw out are that \u2013 is that the full impact, or is that a partial year and you expect more spillover into \u201824?\nJoe Zubretsky: Two concepts, A.J., it\u2019s Joe. First, we always forecast and plan according to the status quo and since the PHE, right at this point will end in October, that\u2019s our planning assumption. We all expect it to be extended to the end of the year, but that\u2019s a separate issue. As we build up our models on a state-by-state basis based on conversations with the state and how they plan to execute the redetermination process, so the buildup of what we do is very much bottoms up. We do, in our forecast. Most of the impact is 2023, some of it spills over into 2024. The key numbers are $3.2 billion of Medicaid revenue gained as the 750,000 membership growth occurred. It will ultimately settle at $1.6 billion and that will roll out mostly in 2023 at $1.2 billion or $400 million spilling over into 2024. Mark, any color to add?\nMark Keim: Yes. A.J., I would just always remind people to do the member month math because it gets complicated, right. If the PHE ends in October, the stipulation is that states have a year from the end of PHE to be done. So, they have got to be done next October. But if you look at the member months, it\u2019s as Joe mentioned, I have got $1.2 billion of headwind in for \u201823 and another $400 million in for 2024.\nA.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Hi. Good morning. If I could ask a two-part question on the 2023 guidance that you gave. For the 10% growth in premium revenue, and obviously, that excludes redeterminations, if you back out the impact of acquisitions, it looks like low-single digit revenue growth. Could you maybe just talk about how that breaks down by line of business? And then you mentioned having industry-leading margins in \u2013 I think doing the quick math on the premium revenue outlook and earnings it looked like you were kind of continuing to be at the top end of that range. So, could you maybe just talk about margin potential from here as we think about the next several years?\nJoe Zubretsky: First on the growth assumptions, we have included a modest, but early view of our organic growth trajectory for next year. If you look back at our Investor Day models, in Medicaid, we say that just by being in Medicaid with premium yield and additions to the Medicaid roles, we are expecting 4% growth. In Medicare, that same phenomenon, yield and growth in the Medicare population, both on agents and penetrations of managed care, will add about 7%. So, when we talk about organic growth, we are talking about merely yield and the growth in the market. And if you weight that at 80% and 13% of revenue, you are talking about perhaps 5% growth just by being in those markets. Then of course, we have our strategic initiatives, which are only halfway done. We are only halfway through 2022. So, we have far more to do on building the book of business for next year. So, we are really happy that at this early stage between our strategic initiatives and an early view of organic growth, we are already accounting for 10% over the 2022 baseline. Your second question again?\nNathan Rich: Yes, sorry, just on the margin opportunity, given that the business is kind of operating today at the high end of the long-term target.\nJoe Zubretsky: Well, one of the reasons why we settled in at $17.60 for our guidance is \u2013 let\u2019s frame where we are. We just printed [indiscernible], revenues growing at 18%, earnings per share growing at 34% on both a six-month and a three-month basis, our pretax margins are 5% and after-tax margins are at 3.7%, and we did that by outperforming the ranges of our MCRs, which produce best-in-class industry margins. So, to continue to forecast that level of outperformance going forward, we thought was a bit imprudent and perhaps too aggressive. So, we were purposely conservative to merely forecast the rest of the year as operating within our long-term target MCR ranges. We are going to end the year at 4.5% pretax margin, 3.3% after-tax and MCRs squarely in those long-term targets, which again produce best-in-class industry margins. We are always looking for ways to improve the performance of the business. We mentioned two very significant operational catalysts going forward, the renegotiation of our pharmacy contract and the fact that we are moving to a permanent remote work strategy. So, we are constantly working the system to try to find ways to attain fixed cost leverage, drive down our G&A ratios and perform at the top end of our long-term ranges for the MCR.\nNathan Rich: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I guess one quick clarification and then from the actual question. When you said 10% revenue growth for next year, then you said partially offset by redeterminations. Was that 10% number including those, or are you saying it was 10%, kind of giving us a sense of how you normally grow, but then net, it will be a little bit less than 10% because of those other items?\nMark Keim: Hey. Good morning. It\u2019s Mark. The 10% is the announced, but not closed acquisitions of AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin as well as that organic growth concept that Joe described, the 4% in Medicaid, more like the 7% in Medicare. The other items then are adjustments, but they are a little vague at the moment. We are still working through those.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay. So, it\u2019s 10 minus something. That\u2019s how to think about it right now. Okay. And then, I guess as you think about the COVID impact. I guess I am struggling a little bit with how you talk about the cohort impact because it seems like it\u2019s a little bit different than how some of your peers are talking about the COVID impact because, like with Q2, you seem to be saying that COVID was a headwind, but that you were able to offset it with medical management. Where most of the companies seem to kind of be saying, for whatever reason, volume didn\u2019t come back the way that it normally does in Q2 and they are being cautious in the back half of the year. You are still being cautious in the back half of the year. But just tying to understand exactly what you think happened in the quarter. Was it an industry-wide phenomenon, or do you kind of view like your controlling trend below and it\u2019s kind of more outperformance or trying to be more sustainable versus maybe a blip in how people use utilization during COVID troughs and peaks and therefore, maybe a little bit less clear about what happens in the back half? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, Kevin. We are pretty disciplined in how we measure the COVID impacts, both the direct cost of COVID-related care and the offsetting curtailment. It\u2019s been uncanny that as COVID infection rates spike, and therefore, the direct cost of COVID care increase, the offset of utilization curtailment has pretty much offset the direct cost of COVID-related care. Now, you are never sure whether that\u2019s going to continue to be that highly correlated. But as I look back over every quarter that \u2013 during the pandemic, that has basically been the case. So, for the most part, our COVID cost is about two-thirds the corridors, the three remaining corridors, and one-third the net effect of COVID direct offset by curtailment.\nMark Keim: Yes. Just to build on that, our definition of the net effect of COVID has been consistent across the 2.5 years here of the pandemic. As Joe mentioned, it\u2019s about two-thirds corridors and then the rest is COVID inpatient direct, which we can measure and then the offsetting curtailment of certain services where we are just not seeing that. We are seeing that relationship be very consistent. We laid out the different impacts line of business by line of business. You saw our Medicaid and marketplace businesses had a relatively light impact. Medicare was a little higher at 370 bps. That\u2019s been typically tracking more around 200 bps. So, that one is just a little bit higher. Line of business to line of business, it bounces around. But across the portfolio, it\u2019s pretty much tracking where we would expect. We are still at that $2.50 for the full year.\nJoe Zubretsky: I was going to say the final proof point is our effective medical cost management actually contain utilization in areas that were unaffected by the COVID infection rate, which would suggest that our utilization routines, our payment integrity routines, all the things we do to effectively medically manage a population are working in areas that were unaffected by COVID. So, we are operating well and managing medical costs very, very well in areas unaffected by COVID.\nKevin Fischbeck: I guess the thing I don\u2019t understand about the corridor comment because if you are at or above your target margin in Medicaid, but you are saying that when corridors go away, then that we should think about you permanently being able to operate above the Medicaid business? Because it seems like you are already at your peak margin in Medicaid. So, if corridors go away, then you would be \u2013 and that\u2019s the base to be thinking about going forward, that you are going to be permanently above that. So, I just \u2013 I am just talking a little bit with kind of how to think about corridors being the net COVID.\nJoe Zubretsky: We understand the math behind that. The simple math is if you take our embedded earnings and just convert it to actual earnings, it would suggest that the margins pop slightly north on a pretax basis of the top end of our range. But two things, one, embedded earnings is in guidance, and two, it doesn\u2019t all emerge at one time or within 1 year. Now, with respect to the corridors, there is only three that matter that remain, and one of them has already been eliminated for October. The two that remain are Mississippi and Washington. And if they persist beyond the pandemic, then they are part of the earnings baseline, and we will live with them for a longer period of time. But there is \u2013we are pretty optimistic that they will fall away over time.\nMark Keim: And Kevin, just to put a point on that, that means that 15 of our 18 Medicaid states are not constrained by corridors. And that\u2019s part of where our margin story is.\nKevin Fischbeck: Alright. Great. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Hall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Hall: Hey. Thanks guys. So, just real quick first on the risk corridor. So, 15 out of 18 that aren\u2019t constrained. But \u2013 so you don\u2019t have any long-standing risk corridors that are pre-COVID in any of those other 15 states?\nMark Keim: We do. That last conversation was specifically around the net effect of COVID and COVID-related corridors. Pre-pandemic, a number of states had different mechanisms that did constrain some profitability, but that\u2019s more our legacy profile. So, we are talking here specifically about COVID era corridors.\nMichael Hall: Got it. But presumably, you are in a net payable position in the other 15 states in some of them, right?\nMark Keim: To a small degree, yes, and that changes year-to-year.\nMichael Hall: Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then my real question. So, it looks like you guys are now expecting low-single digit margins this year for exchange. But heading into the quarter, and I guess even this year, the shift of silver focused pricing efforts, there are seemingly a lot of confidence in improving to mid-single digits. But MLR this quarter, even without the risk adjustment payable, is still much higher than the Street at 85%. And now year-to-date, you guys are tracking the mid-80s, just curious what happened there? You mentioned higher core utilization. What are the dynamics you are seeing and or there is just some mispricing related to that.\nJoe Zubretsky: Well, I mean in summary, we are 200 basis points to 300 basis points off on 7% of our revenue, so putting it in perspective, which we are not happy about. We want to operate in the low-80s. The business breaks even at 85 and we are projecting to do 84 or better for the year, which would be modest profitability. First and foremost, we repositioned the book of business. That was the tall order for 2022, keep it small 7% of revenue. Keep it silver, 75% of our membership is now silver membership. Keep it stable, two-thirds of our membership is now renewal membership when that was completely as the opposite in prior years. So, we have the book of business positioned very, very well. Now, we will work on the 200 basis points to 300 basis points of pressure that is pressuring our MCR. And with the pricing we put in for 2023, on average, 13% to 14% in some states higher, we feel good about getting to those mid-single digit target margins.\nMichael Hall: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Yes. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I was just going to ask you about the new contract with CVS. I don\u2019t know if there is any chance that you can kind of quantify savings opportunity looks like or if there is any meaningful change in the scope or the services that are being provided or\u2026?\nJoe Zubretsky: No change in the scope of services. We have a very good balance between what we operate and what they operate, no change in that. The agreement was extended through 2026. We are not going to talk about the pricing of it. We obviously wouldn\u2019t have mentioned it if it wasn\u2019t an earnings catalyst. But 15% to 20% of our medical cost is pharmacy-related. And the pricing decrement we received was, in our view, noteworthy to discuss as an earnings catalyst for 2023 and beyond. But at this point, we are not going to actually size the pricing.\nGeorge Hill: Okay. So, maybe sizing the pricing isn\u2019t the right way to think about it. But is the \u2013 if we use that range, is there a way to think about how we should think about like what the change to MLR can be as it flows through the income statement, or I guess just kind of any way to kind of quantify the earnings contribution you guys not necessarily the pricing on the contract?\nJoe Zubretsky: Well as I said, at this point in time, we have sized the size of the contract, $4 billion to $5 billion a year of pharmacy spend. But no, we are not yet prepared. When we give 2023 guidance, the CVS Caremark contract would likely be a meaningful contributor to that guidance, and we will potentially talk about it specifically then.\nGeorge Hill: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The last question today comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Hey. Thanks. Good morning guys. I was also going to ask about the exchange business, but a lot of that was covered. I guess the follow-up question around that, though, Joe, when you kind of mentioned those 13% to 14% premium increases that you put in place, how does that stack up relative to your medical cost trend expectation for exchange book for next year? And something that you are mainly focused on margins, but I guess do you expect profit growth within that book the way it stands right now for \u201823? I just want to confirm that. Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Yes. Our strategy for the marketplace business is to target mid-single digit pretax margins and let the revenue float up and down accordingly pursuant to that pricing strategy. Based on the early read, where we actually now have seen competitive pricing, the price increases we put in, in a handful of markets remained very competitive. If we are number one or number two or a close number three or four in the market, we have maintained that position. So, the early read only in a handful of markets is that not only do we believe our pricing has appropriately captured trend, but we maintained our competitive position. So, the book of business shouldn\u2019t materially change.\nMark Keim: The only thing I would add to that is now that we understand current year performance, the base period that we are jumping off we feel much better about. So, we are pricing in a trend that we feel good about going into 2023. Joe mentioned the 13% average rate that we are putting into the market. The only other thing that maybe isn\u2019t obvious as you build your model is that the assumption in there on risk adjustment, right. Those are the three big drivers trend, the changes in risk adjustment for the underlying acuity of the population, and of course, price. You put those things together, and we feel very well positioned for the return to that mid-single digit pretax next year.\nSteven Valiquette: Got it. Okay. Alright. Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. This concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mark Keim",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss some additional details of our second quarter performance, our strong balance sheet, our updated guidance for 2022 and some initial views on the building blocks of our 2023 outlook. Beginning with our second quarter results. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was 88%. Normalizing for approximately $350 million of pass-through payments in our Texas plan, our reported MCR improves to 87.4%. This strong performance, better than the low end of our long-term target range, was driven by strong medical cost management and lower utilization. The net effect of COVID in the quarter was a modest 20 basis point increase to our reported MCR. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 86.9%, also better than the low end of our long-term target range. During the quarter, the net effect of COVID increased our reported MCR by 370 basis points as BA-5 and other variants resulted in increase in patient expense. This pressure was more than offset by favorable risk adjustment and strong medical cost management. In Marketplace, our reported second quarter MCR of 91.2% was inflated by a final true-up of 2021 risk adjustment transfer payments. Normalizing for this out-of-period item, our second quarter MCR was 85.7%. Recall, our Marketplace business was more than twice the size last year, so the prior year settlement had a disproportionate impact on the current year. Second quarter pure-period results were impacted by higher utilization due to the carryover effects of 2021 special enrollment period membership and approximately 50 basis points of net effect of COVID. We remain on track to return our Marketplace business to profitability on a pure-period basis in 2022. In aggregate, the net effect of COVID was consistent with our expectations and decreased net income by $0.68 per share in the quarter. The full year outlook for the net effect of COVID remains at $2.50 per share. Putting it all together, with the two adjustments I described, our reported second quarter MCR for the consolidated company of 88.1% improved to 87.2%. Similarly, our reported pretax margin of 4.4% increases to 5%. And the reported G&A ratio of 6.8% restates to 7%. We continue to expect our full year 2022 G&A ratio to be consistent with our long-term target, reflecting fixed cost leverage on our growth and ongoing discipline. Our results as reported and normalized, displayed the strong performance of our second quarter and the continuing earnings power of the business. Turning now to our balance sheet, our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and we remain confident in this reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter, normalized for pass-through payments, which inflate DCP, was 50.4% consistent with prior quarters. Our capital foundation remained strong. Debt at the end of the quarter was 1.9x trailing 12-month EBITDA, and our debt-to-cap ratio was 45.9%. On a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.7x and 43.7%, respectively. Our leverage remains low. All bond maturities are long-dated, on average 8 years, and our weighted average cost of debt is just 4%. We harvested $165 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, and we purchased approximately 660,000 of our shares for approximately $200 million. Parent company cash at the end of the quarter was $210 million. With substantial incremental debt capacity, cash on hand and strong free cash flow we have ample cash and capital to drive our organic and inorganic growth strategies. Now a few comments on our 2022 guidance. We have increased our full year premium revenue guidance by $750 million to approximately $30 billion, driven by two components: approximately $250 million, reflecting the latest extension of the public health emergency and the related delay in resuming a redetermination of Medicaid eligibility and approximately $500 million for the second quarter outperformance and some additional Texas pass-through revenue. We also raised our full year 2022 adjusted earnings guidance by $0.50 per share to at least $17.60. The increase is driven by three items: second quarter performance above our expectations by about $0.25 per share, margin on the additional revenue from the extension of the public health emergency, which we estimate at about $0.15 per share; an additional net income of $0.10 per share in the second half, driven by the recent rise in interest rates. Normalizing for the out-of-period risk adjustment item of $0.44 per share, our second quarter outperformance increases to about $0.70 per share. We have offset any extrapolation of this second quarter outperformance for the rest of the year with some tempered conservatism. Our first half MCRs outperformed the lower end of our long-term target ranges in both Medicaid and Medicare. In the second half, we are projecting those same ratios to be more in line with our long-term target ranges. As Joe mentioned, our updated guidance will prove conservative if the strong medical cost management and lower utilization we saw in the first half continues through the rest of the year. We expect second half earnings to be distributed fairly evenly between the third and fourth quarters. Finally, some additional color on the building blocks of our initial outlook for 2023. Beginning with premium revenue, our initial outlook is for the announced pending acquisitions of AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin and organic growth to drive approximately 10% growth of our current 2022 premium revenue guidance. We expect this growth to be partially offset by redeterminations and potential pharmacy carve-out. Our 2023 revenue outlook will continue to evolve as we make progress on our in-flight strategic initiatives, including acquisitions and procurement. Turning to adjusted earnings, first, our embedded earnings power is now approximately $3 per share, comprising $2.50 net effect of COVID, $1.50 from our closed and pending acquisitions went at target margin, offset by approximately $1 from the eventual impact of redeterminations. While it's too early to guide on the emergence of these components, we offer some perspectives on what might impact 2023. Within the $2.50 net effect of COVID, corridors in just three states are the primary driver. We expect to see upside here as states terminate these corridors as Ohio already has and the lingering cost of COVID and patient services dissipates to a new normal. Our acquisitions typically reach target margin in the second year of operations. We feel confident we will see a significant portion of the $1.50 emerge in 2023 as Affinity and Cigna Texas will be in their second year and AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin will make their first-year contributions. We now assume redetermination will begin in October, and we expect to lose approximately half of the 750,000 members we gained since the start of the pandemic. These membership attrition assumptions yield a 2023 headwind of $1.2 billion in revenue and $0.70 per share on EPS. Several highly credible data points give us confidence that the margin on members lost through redetermination, have a similar profile to our overall membership. Second, the attractive growth of our legacy business and the associated margin, partially offset by potential pharmacy carve-outs will yield incremental earnings in 2023. Third, as Joe described, we see a combination of new operating drivers that should enhance our 2023 earnings growth, including our recently renegotiated PBM contract, which improves the economics on 15% to 20% of our total medical cost spend and our expected real estate reduction. We plan to reduce the roughly 2 million square feet of leased office space by approximately two-thirds by the end of the year. Finally, we expect higher interest rates to translate into correspondingly higher net investment income. These building blocks provide an early view of some of the most impactful components of our outlook for next year. Our evolving outlook on 2023 will be informed by our performance in the second half of 2022 as well as the ongoing execution of our strategic initiatives. We now feel confident in setting our initial outlook for 2023 adjusted EPS to at least $20. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Yes, sure. Matt, good morning. It's Mark. I think you're looking at the year-over-year change. We had a little more prior year development this second quarter than we did a year ago at this time. And that's not unusual. The way development happens is not always the same year-over-year. The way our providers submit claims and the way our internal operations, including payment integrity work is a little different year-over-year. So yes, the pattern is a little bit different. But what's more important is I'm reporting our DCP at 50.4%, which versus a year ago at 48% is clearly up. The other thing that you guys look at a lot of times is just the growth in premium versus the growth in reserves. My reserves are up 28% year over my premiums are up 18%. So I feel really good about where I'm reserved. I think we're in a good spot. Sure. Just a couple of data points that we track really closely. Remember, within our Medicaid business, there is a TANF chip, there is expansion and there is ABD. So we look at these within each of those. One of the first things we look is the duration, what percentage of our members are with us for more than a year. In TANF chip, it really didn't change meaningfully. ABD didn't really change meaningfully. Expansion is up a little, not huge. Within those populations, though, we also then compare what's the MCR for the folks that are maybe 2 years and longer with us versus the MCR for those less than a year. That's the durational acuity concept that Joe mentioned. It's really flat between those two cohorts in TANF chip. It's pretty flat on ABD. It's a really stable population. So it's up a little in expansion. On the percentage of members with no claims, another one that's good to look at. TANF chip pretty flat, ABD, once again flat. We're seeing a little bit more in expansion. So could you argue that there is going to be a little bit of pressure within expansion? Possibly, but at third of the overall Medicaid book, any impact there gets diluted. So we really don't see this as a big headwind. Yes. A.J., I would just always remind people to do the member month math because it gets complicated, right. If the PHE ends in October, the stipulation is that states have a year from the end of PHE to be done. So, they have got to be done next October. But if you look at the member months, it's as Joe mentioned, I have got $1.2 billion of headwind in for \u201823 and another $400 million in for 2024. Hey. Good morning. It's Mark. The 10% is the announced, but not closed acquisitions of AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin as well as that organic growth concept that Joe described, the 4% in Medicaid, more like the 7% in Medicare. The other items then are adjustments, but they are a little vague at the moment. We are still working through those. Yes. Just to build on that, our definition of the net effect of COVID has been consistent across the 2.5 years here of the pandemic. As Joe mentioned, it's about two-thirds corridors and then the rest is COVID inpatient direct, which we can measure and then the offsetting curtailment of certain services where we are just not seeing that. We are seeing that relationship be very consistent. We laid out the different impacts line of business by line of business. You saw our Medicaid and marketplace businesses had a relatively light impact. Medicare was a little higher at 370 bps. That's been typically tracking more around 200 bps. So, that one is just a little bit higher. Line of business to line of business, it bounces around. But across the portfolio, it's pretty much tracking where we would expect. We are still at that $2.50 for the full year. And Kevin, just to put a point on that, that means that 15 of our 18 Medicaid states are not constrained by corridors. And that's part of where our margin story is. We do. That last conversation was specifically around the net effect of COVID and COVID-related corridors. Pre-pandemic, a number of states had different mechanisms that did constrain some profitability, but that's more our legacy profile. So, we are talking here specifically about COVID era corridors. To a small degree, yes, and that changes year-to-year. The only thing I would add to that is now that we understand current year performance, the base period that we are jumping off we feel much better about. So, we are pricing in a trend that we feel good about going into 2023. Joe mentioned the 13% average rate that we are putting into the market. The only other thing that maybe isn't obvious as you build your model is that the assumption in there on risk adjustment, right. Those are the three big drivers trend, the changes in risk adjustment for the underlying acuity of the population, and of course, price. You put those things together, and we feel very well positioned for the return to that mid-single digit pretax next year."

            "content": "Thank you, Joe and good morning. Today, we will provide updates on several topics: our financial results for the second quarter 2022, our full year 2022 guidance in the context of our second quarter results, our growth initiatives and the reaffirmation of our strategy for sustaining profitable growth, and an early outlook on 2023 premium revenue and earnings growth. Let me start with the second quarter highlights. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.55 for the second quarter, with adjusted net income of $266 million on $7.8 billion of premium revenue. Second quarter adjusted earnings were decreased by $0.44 per share for a true-up to our 2021 final Marketplace risk adjustment transfer payments. Excluding this out-of-period item, our adjusted earnings per share was $4.99. Our 88.1% total company MCR in the second quarter demonstrates strong operating performance even as we navigate prolonged pandemic-related challenges. As Mark will describe later, the reported MCR included increases related to the 2021 Marketplace risk adjustment true-up and the accounting impact of a revenue pass-through. As such, our underlying pure-period MCR was 87.2%. Similarly our reported pre-tax margin of 4.4% increases to 5%, which is at the top end of our long-term target range. For the quarter, we produced 18% premium revenue growth and 34% earnings per share growth. Our year-to-date performance highlighted by an 87.6% MCR, a 6.9% adjusted G&A ratio and a 4.7% pre-tax margin is squarely in line with our long-term targets. Adjusting for the Marketplace risk adjustment true-up and the accounting impact of the revenue pass-through, our underlying pure-period year-to-date MCR was 87.2%. Year-to-date, we produced 19% premium revenue growth and 21% adjusted earnings per share growth. Medicaid, our flagship business, representing 80% of enterprise revenue, continues to produce a very strong and predictable operating results and cash flows. The rate environment is stable, COVID costs have tempered and we are executing on the sound fundamentals of medical cost management. The ongoing and consistent high earnings quality in the first 6 months produced at reported MCR of 88.1%. Our diversified geographic footprint and mix of products, including management of high acuity members, provides us with an excellent earnings ballast. Our high acuity Medicare niche serving low-income members, representing 13% of enterprise revenue, continues to grow organically and outperform our long-term target margins. The year-to-date reported MCR of 86.7%, even while still pressured by the cost of COVID-related care, is below the low end of our long-term target range. Each of our products, D-SNP, MAPD, WEDI/SNIP and MMP, contributed to this favorable result. Marketplace at 7% of enterprise revenue is tracking to return to profitability in 2022 on a pure-period basis. We have succeeded in keeping the business small, keeping it silver and keeping it stable. The true-up to 2021 risk adjustment is largely due to the surge of special enrollment period membership that we experienced in the last half of 2021. On a pure-period basis, 2022 is on track to achieve a low single-digit pre-tax margin. In summary, we are very pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date performance. We executed well, delivered solid operating earnings and continued to deliver on our growth strategy. Turning now to our 2022 guidance, we now project premium revenue to be approximately $30 billion or $750 million above our previous guidance. Our updated 2022 guidance represents a 3-year 23% compound annual growth rate since our pivot to growth in 2019. Excluding the estimated impact of the redetermination pause, our 3-year compound annual growth rate is 18%. We are also increasing our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance to at least $17.60. Our increased 2022 outlook features strong premium revenue growth of 12%, which includes the impact of our conscious decision to reset the size and scope of our Marketplace business, a pre-tax margin at the midpoint of our long-term guidance range, and strong earnings per share growth of 30%. We have purposely remained conservative in our full year 2022 earnings guidance. Our year-to-date underlying performance is highlighted by effective management of medical costs, both COVID and non-COVID, that were favorable to our expectations. In this environment, which is still being affected by the emergence of new COVID variants, it is prudent to remain cautious in forecasting medical cost trends. In the first half of the year, for Medicaid and Medicare, which account for 93% of enterprise revenues, we produced MCRs at or below the low-end of our target ranges. We believe it is prudent to project MCRs to be within the target range for the second half of the year. Bear in mind that our target MCR ranges result in industry leading margins. With that being said, if we were to repeat our first half performance with respect to medical cost management in the second half, then it is highly likely we would outperform this full year earnings guidance. Turning now to an update on our long-term strategy for sustaining profitable growth. We remain confident that we will deliver on our long-term growth targets of 13% to 15% premium revenue growth and 15% to 18% adjusted earnings per share growth on average over time and sustained 4% to 5% pre-tax margins. Our recent performance is supportive of that outlook. Our model for organic growth remains sound. In Medicaid, our market share is high enough to be relevant to our state-based partners and gives us sufficient scale, but low enough to provide an environment for market share gains. Although it has been difficult to measure during the pandemic, we have grown market share in many of our states. The political landscape remains focused on reducing the uninsured population favoring government-sponsored programs and driving underlying growth in our current footprint. The economy has had a significant impact on the low-wage service sector as well. We continue to believe the post-pandemic Medicaid roles will be higher than pre-pandemic levels. On the RFP front, our past track record gives us confidence in successfully retaining the Medicaid contracts that are currently in a reprocurement process. Our RFP responses have been submitted in Mississippi, California and for Texas Star+ in our pending evaluation and subsequent award announcement. We are well positioned to retain these contracts due to our track record of operational and clinical excellence, standing and reputation, innovation and the demonstrated ability to write winning proposals. With multiple new RFP opportunities over the coming years, we remain confident in our ability to win additional new state contracts. We submitted our proposals in the states of Iowa and Nebraska and have many other new state business development initiatives well underway. In Medicare, the rate environment and demographic trends remain supportive of sustainable growth. Additionally, we have opportunities to further penetrate our Medicaid footprint in both D-SNP and low-income MAPD products. Our three distribution channels have achieved a high degree of productivity and have lowered our cost of acquisition. Consequently, we are investing heavily in these channels. In Marketplace, our focus is on keeping it small in the context of the overall portfolio and pricing with a goal of achieving mid single-digit pre-tax margins. As a result, we will grow this business only as allowed by this pricing strategy. Moving now to our inorganic growth strategy, our M&A platform continues to execute at a high level. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of My Choice Wisconsin's MLTSS and core Medicaid assets for an attractive purchase price of approximately 15% of revenue. This acquisition is highly complementary to our expanding Wisconsin Medicaid footprint and our growing MLTSS business. My Choice Wisconsin serves over 44,000 members and generates premium revenue of approximately $1 billion. We expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to adjusted earnings and deliver first year adjusted EPS of $0.15 and $0.45 at full run-rate. In addition to being perfectly consistent with our product and geographic growth strategy, the acquisition of My Choice Wisconsin validates the vibrancy and actionability of our expansive M&A opportunity pipeline. With the addition of My Choice Wisconsin, our enterprise MLTSS business will be attached to over $9 billion in premium revenue and over $6 billion of LTSS benefits paid. Over the past 10 months, between AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin, we have announced nearly $2 billion in acquired revenue, which will be included in our 2023 premium revenue based on the expected timing of closing both transactions. We have now announced 7 acquisitions since we embarked on our growth strategy. The 5 already closed are achieving or exceeding their earnings accretion target. Given our track record and a pipeline replete with actionable and strategically focused acquisition opportunities, we are confident in our ability to continue to execute on this important dimension of our growth strategy. In summary, the company's financial and operational performance validates our long-term revenue growth strategy and its value creation potential. Turning now to our initial outlook for 2023, while it is far too early to provide specific 2023 financial guidance, I will offer a view of some of the building blocks of our initial outlook for 2023. First, with respect to 2023 revenue, we continue to build the 2023 book of business throughout this year. At this early stage, we have line of sight to nearly 10% growth in 2023 from our strategic initiatives and an early estimate of organic growth. This growth will be partially offset by the impact of redeterminations, which we have spoken about at length and one or two potential pharmacy carve-outs, the timing and extent of which are uncertain. We are only halfway through 2022, and therefore, additional M&A announcements and new Medicaid procurement wins would add to the 2023 revenue picture. Now turning to 2023 earnings. First, in 2022, we are carrying approximately $3 per share of embedded earnings power, which we expect to be realized in 2023 and beyond. This estimate, which has been updated since last quarter, comprises net effect of COVID and full accretion on M&A earnings, offset by redetermination impacts. Second, we expect the core book of business will grow organically. As we have demonstrated in the past, when we grow organically, we achieve our target margins. Third, in the quarter, we have finalized or significantly progressed on some major initiatives, which provide earnings upside, two of which are noteworthy. We recently renegotiated and executed a new PBM contract with CVS Caremark, which extends the existing contract term at substantially more favorable pricing. Since pharmacy accounts for 15% to 20% of our medical cost baseline, the improved rate structure will substantially improve our pharmacy economics and resulting medical cost trend. The CVS Caremark relationship has been essential to our delivery of excellent pharmacy service to our customers and members and has enabled strong cost control. We are very pleased to have extended this relationship. And secondly, we intend to move permanently to a remote work environment, a model we have been working under successfully for nearly 2 years. As a result, by the end of this year, we expect to formalize a reduction of our real estate footprint by approximately two-thirds, yielding substantial and sustainable G&A savings. These building blocks aggregate to a very attractive earnings trajectory for 2023 and beyond, although the timing of emergence for each of these is still evolving. That being said, with 2022 adjusted earnings guidance of at least $17.60 per share, embedded earnings power of $3 per share, the earnings contribution of organic growth and the operational catalysts we just mentioned, we fully expect our 2023 adjusted earnings to be at least $20 per share. Although it is too early in the cycle to provide specific earnings guidance for 2023, we are very confident in this earnings outlook. We will certainly update this outlook as it evolves, informed by our performance in the second half of 2022 and the ongoing execution of our strategic initiatives. In conclusion, in the second quarter, we performed very well across the enterprise. Our 2022 earnings base [Technical Difficulty], our growth strategy is working and our early outlook for 2023 is strong. We are executing on our long-term strategic plan and delivering results accordingly. Of course, we could not do this without our excellent management team and dedicated associates, now approaching 15,000 strong. We have produced these results under the difficult and rapidly changing circumstances of the pandemic. To the entire team, I once again extend my deepest thanks and heartfelt appreciation. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark? Sure, Josh. Really, it was a function of the surge of special enrollment membership we experienced last year. If you recall, we took on 250,000 members between March and the end of the year. And of course, we had to really gear up and scale up to service that membership, including risk adjustment. So I think part of it was keeping pace with the surge of membership and getting the risk scores. I think part of it was the acuity of the membership. And I think another part of it was just the imprecise nature of actuarial estimations given that unstable environment. The good news for this year is we became aware of this emerging trend early in the quarter as we were developing our final pricing in the Marketplace, and we're able to take the current view of the acuity of this population into consideration as we filed our final prices for 2023. Yes, we can. Sure, Stephen. I'll kick it to Mark for some of the actual numbers. But as a matter of routine in the Medicaid business, one needs to understand the duration of its membership. Duration could have an impact on the acuity of a population. So it's something we routinely look at. I will tell you that during the pandemic, the duration of membership, the length of time people are on the Medicaid rolls didn't extend all that much. And I will tell you that the differences in acuity as measured by medical care ratios is not that much different on short duration members versus long duration members. We have lots of other actuarial and medical economics data points that suggest that the members that will leave, will leave at portfolio averages. But I'll turn it to Mark for a little more color on that. Two concepts, A.J., it's Joe. First, we always forecast and plan according to the status quo and since the PHE, right at this point will end in October, that's our planning assumption. We all expect it to be extended to the end of the year, but that's a separate issue. As we build up our models on a state-by-state basis based on conversations with the state and how they plan to execute the redetermination process, so the buildup of what we do is very much bottoms up. We do, in our forecast. Most of the impact is 2023, some of it spills over into 2024. The key numbers are $3.2 billion of Medicaid revenue gained as the 750,000 membership growth occurred. It will ultimately settle at $1.6 billion and that will roll out mostly in 2023 at $1.2 billion or $400 million spilling over into 2024. Mark, any color to add? First on the growth assumptions, we have included a modest, but early view of our organic growth trajectory for next year. If you look back at our Investor Day models, in Medicaid, we say that just by being in Medicaid with premium yield and additions to the Medicaid roles, we are expecting 4% growth. In Medicare, that same phenomenon, yield and growth in the Medicare population, both on agents and penetrations of managed care, will add about 7%. So, when we talk about organic growth, we are talking about merely yield and the growth in the market. And if you weight that at 80% and 13% of revenue, you are talking about perhaps 5% growth just by being in those markets. Then of course, we have our strategic initiatives, which are only halfway done. We are only halfway through 2022. So, we have far more to do on building the book of business for next year. So, we are really happy that at this early stage between our strategic initiatives and an early view of organic growth, we are already accounting for 10% over the 2022 baseline. Your second question again? Well, one of the reasons why we settled in at $17.60 for our guidance is \u2013 let's frame where we are. We just printed [indiscernible], revenues growing at 18%, earnings per share growing at 34% on both a six-month and a three-month basis, our pretax margins are 5% and after-tax margins are at 3.7%, and we did that by outperforming the ranges of our MCRs, which produce best-in-class industry margins. So, to continue to forecast that level of outperformance going forward, we thought was a bit imprudent and perhaps too aggressive. So, we were purposely conservative to merely forecast the rest of the year as operating within our long-term target MCR ranges. We are going to end the year at 4.5% pretax margin, 3.3% after-tax and MCRs squarely in those long-term targets, which again produce best-in-class industry margins. We are always looking for ways to improve the performance of the business. We mentioned two very significant operational catalysts going forward, the renegotiation of our pharmacy contract and the fact that we are moving to a permanent remote work strategy. So, we are constantly working the system to try to find ways to attain fixed cost leverage, drive down our G&A ratios and perform at the top end of our long-term ranges for the MCR. Sure, Kevin. We are pretty disciplined in how we measure the COVID impacts, both the direct cost of COVID-related care and the offsetting curtailment. It's been uncanny that as COVID infection rates spike, and therefore, the direct cost of COVID care increase, the offset of utilization curtailment has pretty much offset the direct cost of COVID-related care. Now, you are never sure whether that's going to continue to be that highly correlated. But as I look back over every quarter that \u2013 during the pandemic, that has basically been the case. So, for the most part, our COVID cost is about two-thirds the corridors, the three remaining corridors, and one-third the net effect of COVID direct offset by curtailment. I was going to say the final proof point is our effective medical cost management actually contain utilization in areas that were unaffected by the COVID infection rate, which would suggest that our utilization routines, our payment integrity routines, all the things we do to effectively medically manage a population are working in areas that were unaffected by COVID. So, we are operating well and managing medical costs very, very well in areas unaffected by COVID. We understand the math behind that. The simple math is if you take our embedded earnings and just convert it to actual earnings, it would suggest that the margins pop slightly north on a pretax basis of the top end of our range. But two things, one, embedded earnings is in guidance, and two, it doesn't all emerge at one time or within 1 year. Now, with respect to the corridors, there is only three that matter that remain, and one of them has already been eliminated for October. The two that remain are Mississippi and Washington. And if they persist beyond the pandemic, then they are part of the earnings baseline, and we will live with them for a longer period of time. But there is \u2013we are pretty optimistic that they will fall away over time. Well, I mean in summary, we are 200 basis points to 300 basis points off on 7% of our revenue, so putting it in perspective, which we are not happy about. We want to operate in the low-80s. The business breaks even at 85 and we are projecting to do 84 or better for the year, which would be modest profitability. First and foremost, we repositioned the book of business. That was the tall order for 2022, keep it small 7% of revenue. Keep it silver, 75% of our membership is now silver membership. Keep it stable, two-thirds of our membership is now renewal membership when that was completely as the opposite in prior years. So, we have the book of business positioned very, very well. Now, we will work on the 200 basis points to 300 basis points of pressure that is pressuring our MCR. And with the pricing we put in for 2023, on average, 13% to 14% in some states higher, we feel good about getting to those mid-single digit target margins. No change in the scope of services. We have a very good balance between what we operate and what they operate, no change in that. The agreement was extended through 2026. We are not going to talk about the pricing of it. We obviously wouldn't have mentioned it if it wasn't an earnings catalyst. But 15% to 20% of our medical cost is pharmacy-related. And the pricing decrement we received was, in our view, noteworthy to discuss as an earnings catalyst for 2023 and beyond. But at this point, we are not going to actually size the pricing. Well as I said, at this point in time, we have sized the size of the contract, $4 billion to $5 billion a year of pharmacy spend. But no, we are not yet prepared. When we give 2023 guidance, the CVS Caremark contract would likely be a meaningful contributor to that guidance, and we will potentially talk about it specifically then. Yes. Our strategy for the marketplace business is to target mid-single digit pretax margins and let the revenue float up and down accordingly pursuant to that pricing strategy. Based on the early read, where we actually now have seen competitive pricing, the price increases we put in, in a handful of markets remained very competitive. If we are number one or number two or a close number three or four in the market, we have maintained that position. So, the early read only in a handful of markets is that not only do we believe our pricing has appropriately captured trend, but we maintained our competitive position. So, the book of business shouldn't materially change."

[Operator Instructions] And I'd now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJoe Krocheski: Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare's first quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim.  A press release announcing the first quarter earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be made available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made are as of today, Thursday, April 28, 2022, and will not be updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. In this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our first quarter 2021 press release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding current 2022 guidance, our growth strategy and expected growth, our RFPs positions, the COVID-19 pandemic, our acquisitions, our future margins and embedded earnings power and our long-term outlook. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the Risk Factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report for the 2020 year filed with the SEC as well as the Risk Factors listed in our Form 10-Q and our Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?\nJoe Zubretsky: Thank you, Joe. And good morning. Today, we will provide you with updates on several topics: our financial results for the first quarter 2022; our full year 2022 guidance in the context of our first quarter results and our growth initiatives and the reaffirmation of our strategy for sustaining profitable growth.  Let me start with the first quarter highlights. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of $4.90 with adjusted net income of $288 million. First quarter premium revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $7.5 billion, driven by strong membership gains in Medicaid and Medicare. Our 87.1% consolidated MCR in the first quarter is squarely in line with our long-term target range and demonstrates strong operating performance even as we continue to navigate pandemic-related challenges. In the quarter, the net effective COVID increased our consolidated MCR by approximately 50 basis points, decreasing net per diluted share by approximately $0.57. Within the net effect of COVID inpatient COVID costs in the quarter were the highest since the beginning of the pandemic, surging in the month of January and then steadily subsiding throughout the quarter. These costs were mostly off by COVID related utilization, curtailment and effective medical cost management. Despite the continued pandemic-related impact, we produced an adjusted after-tax margin of 3.7%, a very strong result that is at the high end of our long-term target range and consistent with normal seasonal patterns. Turning now to highlights by line of business. In Medicaid, we ended the quarter with approximately 4.6 million members an increase of approximately 700,000 or 18% year-over-year. This strong performance drove 24% Medicaid premium revenue growth year over year. Increased membership was the balanced result of our recent acquisitions and organic gains supported by the redetermination pause. In the first quarter, we continued to generate excellent margins in our Medicaid business with a medical care ratio at 88.1%, which is in line with our long-term target. The enduring highlights of our flagship Medicaid business are as follows. Our diversified portfolio of 18 state contracts provides for excellent distribution of risk related to rate setting and contract reprocurements, actuarially sound rates prevail, and the rate setting process establishes a credible medical cost baseline with forward trend and benefit changes. Poor medical cost trends remain stable and well controlled. The few remaining COVID risk-sharing corridors continue to capture some of our outperformance, but we expect these to be eliminated over time. And we continue to execute our growth strategy. Our in-state market shares are large enough to be relevant to our state customers, yet small enough to support significant growth opportunity. In Medicare, we ended the quarter with 148,000 members or 17% growth year-over-year, with related premium revenue growth of 18%. Our performance was driven primarily by organic gains and our D-SNP and MAPD products as we continue to increase our market share and our existing footprint and expand geographically to match our Medicaid footprint. Our reported Medicare MCR was very strong on the quarter at 86.5%, which is below the low end of our long-term target range, even after absorbing 190 basis points of COVID-related pressure. In marketplace we ended the quarter with 371,000 members. This result is higher than previously projected, driven by higher-than-expected effectuation rates during the later stages of open enrollment. The declines in membership and premium from prior year are consistent with our previously communicated strategy to reposition the book of business and its risk profile. Our marketplace business is now more appropriately sized in the overall portfolio. Our first quarter marketplace MCR was 78.6%. This result is in line with our long-term target, even after absorbing 270 basis points of COVID-related pressure and reflects the successful implementation of our strategy to restore this business to target margins. As Mark will discuss in a moment, the favorable mix of renewal membership and the silver-tier products, gives us great confidence that we will achieve our 2022 margin goal. In summary 2022 is off to a very strong start. Medicaid, our flagship business, representing 80% of revenue, continues to produce strong, predictable operating results, and cash flow.  Our high acuity Medicare niche serving low-income members continues to grow organically and exceeded our long-term target margins. In marketplace a complimentary product in our government subsidized strategy is now well-positioned for success at 7% of total company premium revenue. Turning now to our 2022 guidance, beginning with premium revenue. We now project premium revenue to be approximately $29.25 billion or approximately $750 million above our previous guidance. Our revenue growth rates are consistent with our long-term targets. Specifically, our updated premium revenue guidance now includes approximately $400 million of additional Medicaid revenue resulting from the extension of the public health emergency from April to July and the associated suspension of membership redeterminations. Approximately $100 million of marketplace revenue resulting from stronger open enrollment as we now expect to end 2022 with approximately 270,000 members. And approximately $250 million related to state-based passthrough revenue payments. As in the past, we have excluded from our premium revenue guidance, any impact of the AgeWell acquisition, which we expect to close in the third quarter of this year. Turning now to earnings guidance: We are increasing our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance to know less than $17.10. Specifically our increased 2022 earnings guidance reflects the favorable impacts of strong first quarter performance, underlying strength in the business in the rest of the year, the margin associated with the increase in our premium revenue, the combination of which is largely offset by a $0.50 per share increase in projected net effect of COVID. We have remained cautious in forecasting utilization trends in the remaining nine months of the year. Due to the uncertainties of COVID, and related utilization curtailment as well as core medical cost trend we believe at the end of the second quarter our membership will have seasoned enough to allow us to fine tune our forecast of COVID related medical cost and core medical cost trend. We are confident in our 2022 outlook that features revenue growth rates consistent with our long-term targets, and after tax margin at the midpoint of our long-term guidance range and strong earnings per share growth of 26%. Turning now to an update on our strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Building on our momentum from last year, we are off to a strong start in 2022. Based on our past track record, we are confident in successfully retaining the Medicaid contract that are currently in a procurement process. Our RFP responses have been submitted in Mississippi and California and are pending evaluation and subsequent award announcement. The Texas STAR+PLUS RFP has been issued by the state and our response is currently being developed. We have a high degree of confidence in retaining these contracts as a result of our operational and clinical excellence, standing and reputation, innovation and the demonstrated ability to write winning proposals. At the beginning of the year we successfully launched our Medicaid plan in Nevada, adding a new state to our footprint and 125,000 members. With multiple RFP opportunities over the coming years, we remain confident in our ability to win additional new state contracts. We have one new state proposal pending in Rhode Island and many other new state business development opportunities well in process. Our M&A platform continues to execute at a high level. On January 1st, we closed on the acquisition of Cigna's Texas Medicaid business, deepening our service offerings in the state and adding 44,000 high acuity members. Our acquired businesses are achieving or exceeding their earnings accretion targets. The pipeline of acquisition opportunities remains robust. We are confident in our ability to drive continued value from this important dimension of our growth strategy. The company's performance continues to validate our long-term strategy and its value creation and potential. We can and will grow the top line at 13% to 15% per year on average over time by a combination of market share gains, new contract wins, footprint expansion and of course bolt-on M&A. We can achieve this growth and maintain pre-tax margins in the range of 4Tto 5%. Rates are stable and our effectiveness at medical cost management while ensuring optimum quality has been consistently demonstrated. A number of external factors are combining to support government sponsored healthcare. In particular demographics, economic disruptions and political priorities are working together to generate meaningful tailwinds for the industry. And finally, our strong cash flow generation gives us ample capacity to invest in new capabilities and acquisitions. Our strategy is sound validated with each quarter's performance and will continue to be valued creating. As I conclude my remarks, I want to express my continued gratitude to our management team and to our nearly 14,000 Molina colleagues, their skill, dedication and steadfast service form the foundation for everything we have achieved and everything we will achieve in the years to come. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Keim for some additional color on the financials. Mark?\nMark Keim: Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss some additional details of our first quarter performance. I will then turn to the balance sheet and some thoughts on our 2022 guidance. Beginning with some detailed commentary of out our first quarter results, the total company net effective COVID reduced net income by $0.57 per share and added 50 basis points to the consolidated MCR. This result was largely consistent with our expectations. However, the impact varied by lines of business with minimal impact on Medicaid and larger impacts on marketplace and Medicare. In Medicaid our reported MCR was 88.1%, a strong result that was in-line with our long-term target. For the quarter the net effective COVID was a modest 10 basis point increase to our reported MCR as the high volume of inpatient stays and COVID related corridors we're largely offset by curtailment of utilization. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 86.5% better than our long-term target. During the quarter, the net effect of COVID increased our reported MCR by 190 basis points. This pressure was more than offset by favorable risk adjustment and product mix. In marketplace our reported MCR was 78.6%, this result was in line with our long-term target despite absorbing 270 basis points of net effect of COVID. Our reported MCR was also influenced by our strategy of focusing on silver products, which experienced less MCR seasonality than bronze products due to lower deductibles. Silver members, as a percent of our book increased from approximately 50% in the first quarter of 2021 to 75% in the first quarter of 2022. Additionally renewal members now comprised two-thirds of our membership, up from one-third last year. These factors combined with a more limited SEP in 2022 give us continued confidence in restoring margins to our mid-single digit target in 2022. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7.1%, reflecting increased temporary of labor costs due to industry-wide hiring challenges and some one-time items. We expect our full year 2022 G&A ratio to be consistent with our long-term target. Turning now to our balance sheet: Our capital foundation remained strong. We harvested $115 million of some bestiary dividends in the quarter and our quarter-end parent company cash balance was $250 million. Debt at the end of the quarter was 2.1 times trailing 12-month EBITDA. Our debt-to-cap ratio is 46.3%. However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.8 times and 43.5% respectively. These metrics reflect a conservative leverage position and ample cash capacity for additional growth and investment. Turning to reserves: Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and we continue to be confident in our reserve position. Days and claims payable at the end of the quarter was flat sequentially at 51 days of medical cost expense. Finally, a few comments on guidance. We have increased our 2022 adjusted earnings guidance to no less than $17.10 per share. We continue to project slightly more than half of the year's earnings in the first two quarters. In addition, we have increased our view of embedded earnings by $0.25 to $2.75 per share. The increase is driven by the higher net effect of COVID we are now expecting this year, partly offset by moderately higher impact from redetermination that we expect next year stemming from the extension of the public health emergency. As a reminder, this embedded earnings power does not represent 2023 guidance, but rather an accounting of drivers that are temporarily suppressing our earnings profile, and our current projection of the impact of Medicaid redeterminations post 2022. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBen Rossi: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question here. Ben Rossi filling in for Matt. I just wanted to ask about the exchange. So as a follow-up to the expected revenue number attrition for marketplace, which decreased about 30% for premiums and about half membership enrollment from year-end last year, can you help us think about how trends and marketplace margins were impacted by the diverse selection dynamic this past quarter compared to where margins sit at the end of the year? Because you previously mentioned last call about a possible 7 to 8 point increase during the quarter. I'm just curious on how that progress is coming along. And where do you think the rate of about 1.5% to 2% monthly attrition is still representative for the group?\nJoe Zubretsky: Hi Ben, this is Joe. The marketplace business is now perfectly positioned to achieve our mid-single digit pre-tax margin target for the year. I will tell you it's very difficult to make comparisons year-over-year given the substantial mix shift that we orchestrated from 2021 to 2022. So some data points are 78.6% MCR in the quarter was burdened by 270 basis points of COVID \u2013 so on our ex-COVID basis is closer to 76 that will light grow for seasonality during the year modestly. And we believe we'll achieve in the middle of our long-term target range at 79% for the full year. We're confident in that, as Marc said in the prepared remarks because of the mix of renewal membership versus new membership, which is now two-third renewal, one-third new. The mix of silver versus bronze, which is now 75/15 and last year it was 55/45 and the fact that the SEP period last year took all comers. There were no income cutoffs and this year we believe the eligible population for SEP has been basically reduced by half due to the limitation on income to 150% of FPL. So year-over-year comparisons are very, very difficult given the dramatic orchestrated shift in the book. The business is now very, very well positioned to achieve our mid annual digit pretax margin for the full year.\nBen Rossi: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I just wanted to clarify the comment about how MLR has performed versus your long-term target in Q1. Is that basically a comment that you'd expect the years MLR to come in as expected because some businesses, I guess, particularly the exchanges have that seasonality where you'd expect Q1 to always be the lowest in the quarter, and therefore almost always be below your target MLR for the year? Or are you saying it's below your target MLR for Q1? Just trying to understand if you're telling us that this will persist to the rest of the year or just whether Q1 was a good quarter?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure. Kevin, it's Joe, and then I'll kick it to Mark. Yes, there is some modest seasonality to the business. In fact, I would say that the seasonality and marketplace is much more dampen than it has in the past due to the higher silver mix that we have one data two. The answer to your question is both, we're hitting our long-term targets both on the quarter and we expect to hit them for the full year, although there's 70 to 90 basis points of seasonality from the front end of the year to the back end of the year. Mark?\nMark Keim: Yes, that's exactly right, Joe. The answer is both within the quarter all three lines of business were in \u2013 within the long-term guidance. In fact, Medicare was better and they're all tracking to be squarely in the middle of long-term guidance on a full year basis and of course that's reflected in our full year guidance Operator?\nOperator: The next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. So yes, just regarding the COVID impact on MLR across all your books of business in the first quarter, it was obviously pretty low on Medicaid, but then much higher on Medicare and marketplace. I guess I'm curious which one of the three COVID impact trends really surprised you the most in the first quarter? And also as we think about that the extra $0.50 of EPS headwind in the guidance for 2022 from COVID, is there any bias for that to be skewed towards any of the specific books of business? Or is that just too hard to predict right now? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Hi, Steven, it's Joe, and then I'll kick it to Mark for some additional color. The net effect of COVID was slightly higher than our expectations in the quarter. I remind everyone that we calculate or estimate the net effect of COVID as being the direct inpatient cost of COVID related care offset by an estimate of what we believe to be utilization curtailment due to the pandemic. And furthermore the effect of our outperformance in the states that continued to carry the COVID related corridors forward. That's how we calculate the impact. For the most part in the recent past we've seen the direct cost of COVID related care, which were very significant in the quarter. It surged in January and was significantly reduced in both February and March, pretty much offset by curtailment, not totally but pretty much. And then of course our outperformance, which we continue to enjoy in the states that have carried for the corridors, continues to be captured by the corridors. So it was a little higher than expected and the reason we increased our estimate for the full year is you're never completely comfortable that curtailment will always be a direct offset to COVID related care. And to the extent it doesn't, we wanted to be conservative with our outlook for the year.\nMark Keim: Yes. And just to build on Joe's comments, clearly in Q1 we saw higher net effective COVID as a percentage or in the MCR in Medicare and marketplace. As Joe mentioned the increase of $0.50 across the rest of the year really about some certainties and some conservativism about the outlook for the cost of COVID in-patient in the related curtailment. Where that might manifest? We've typically seen a little more in Medicare and marketplace, but it can move around among the lines of business but I think that's a pretty good overview of our outlook.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay. That's great. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on your comments around the $2.75 of kind of pent-up earnings. And as I look at your \u2013 as I look at your run rates from an EPS perspective, it looks like your margins are towards the or pinned to the higher end of your old target rates across the book. One is that right or do you feel like you've still got some room to the high end? And if so, if you are at the higher end, do you feel like you have upside to those margin targets? Do you feel like there's further room in terms of earnings power or should we look at that $2.75 as being more cushion again something that could happen, like state rates, get a little tougher or what have you?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure. Justin, its Joe, and then I'll turn to Mark for some color. But we are operating in the first quarter given the seasonality of the business, at the high end of our margin range we produced an after tax margin of 3.7% on a pretax margin of 4.9%. For the year, as I just suggested with the MCR seasonality commentary that that will moderate to where we estimate in our full year guidance of pretax margin of approximately 4.4% and 3.3% after tax in the middle of the range. So yes, if you then take embedded earnings purely without any other puts and takes for future forecasting and guidance; it would bring you higher in the range, which is entirely possible. But as you suggest our embedded earnings guidance is not a forecast. Our embedded earnings estimate is not a forecast and is not guidance. And yes, it could move us the top end of the range or act as a buffer against other things that we need to forecast in the future.\nMark Keim: That's right, Justin. So as Joe mentioned, guidance is smack in the middle of the range, 3.3% is in the middle of the range of 3% to 3.7%, so next year that's $2.75 is certainly upside. The flip side as we grow our business, we stack on M&A, we add new procurements. Those tend to come in a little lower in margin in the early years, and you've always got the impact of organic. So what we always say is it's certainly not guidance. It's just an accounting of some of the things that are depressing earnings this year. There'll be other things to add in next year, but it's certainly a good tailwind into 2023.\nJustin Lake: All right. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more on what drove the higher COVID headwind estimate that's now incorporated in guidance. And it seems like it may you related to just a more conservative forecasting on non-COVID utilization trends. I was just wondering if you could kind of go into more detail on what you've seen in March, as COVID cases have died down and how we should think about kind of the 2Q and the go-forward there? Thank you.\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, Nathan. The first thing I would say is when I say it subsided during the quarter, it did so dramatically. Our COVID direct cost of care in January were the highest since the beginning of the pandemic. In February those costs were cut to one-third of the January actual and in March cut yet another one-third in March off of February, a dramatic decline. But the BAQ was out there and while the infection rate is high, the severity and the treatment protocols are actually quite light. However, we never know whether it's going to resurge and we wanted to be as you suggested cautious with our outlook for COVID, particularly because in the recent past utilization curtailment has nearly offset the entire direct cost of cover related care. We never have full assurance that that will continue. Our second point, on what we call core medical cost trend, just the routine of cranking up our medical economics engine and truly understanding all the different dimensions of medical costs. We saw nothing in the quarter that surprised us or was unusual. All the things that you've read about and are being reported on where orthopedic procedures coming back with joint replacements, the ambulatory and outpatient settings are back in business, and we're seeing an uptick, but nothing unusual. We see spikes in pharmacy costs here and there; as some of our state single preferred drug lists sometimes promote the use of branded drugs. So nothing unusual and nothing surprising. It's the normal many inflection points here and there, but we wanted to remain cautious. We are hopefully on the tail end of the pandemic and we usually are cautious in our medical cost forecasting and want to see Q2 results before we put a better fine tune estimate on it.\nNathan Rich: Thanks very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Hall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Hall: Hey, thank you guys. Just want to dive a little deeper on redeterminations. So with the resumption of redetermination being pushed out further and further into the year just in terms of timing in cadence of recapturing those lives into your exchange book, as those lives drop off, would you anticipate more of a, I guess like an immediate turnaround on recapturing them or is it more reasonable to assume the [indiscernible] might take couple or a few months to sign up? And on the net impact on those labs, on one hand I know you price for sizeable margin improvement on those new lives, so they should becoming more profitable, but as these lives come onto your book later in the year, it becomes more difficult to properly risk score them. So just want to get your thoughts on that?\nJoe Zubretsky: Well Michael, we always characterize the redetermination phenomenon as when it's going to happen is really just a mathematical exercise of when the membership trips and revenue follows, which fiscal years is it going to hit. And right now it's \u2013 we're going to enjoy that membership and revenue for a longer period of time in 2022, and more of it will fall off in 2023. I think we think the real key point is how much of it persists beyond the redetermination period. And our forecast is that we grew 750,000 even slightly higher than that of organic growth in Medicaid since the beginning of the pandemic, we forecast to retain half of it. We believe the revenue growth associated with that was $2.9 billion, and we'll continue to have $1.6 billion of that when the re-determined processes complete. We also respect because CMS is now given clear guidance and is concerned with people being orphaned without healthcare, that they've made it a lot easier for us to work with our state customers to warm transfer members off of Medicaid if they're no longer eligible into marketplace and or Medicare, and these are products we continually enjoy. So that's sort of the strategy we have operational protocols in place to handle all this. We are concerned with the individual state's ability to handle a tremendous amount of value, 80 million people going through redetermination and re-eligibility inside of one-year is a huge undertaking. But we are really confident in the forecast that we've given on how much membership we will retain and potentially warm transfer into marketplace. Mark anything on the year-over-year comparison?\nMark Keim: Joe, I think you hit the key points there. The only thing Michael that you also asked about is just the timing of them coming over from redetermination to marketplace, that'll vary. In certain places we have really good operations to proactively reach out to people, help them with their redetermination and to the extent they lose Medicaid eligibility, immediately get them signed up in marketplace. In other cases, members may fall off and after a month or two come back on. So I think state-by-state as the rules slightly vary exactly how those transitions work will vary as well, but I think you've hit the big points.\nOperator: The next question comes from A. J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA. J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Just maybe to continue on discussion about the marketplace is obviously the enhanced subsidies under the ACA are potential to go away at the end of the year if Congress doesn't act. Do you have a sense of how much of your marketplace membership today might be impacted by that? How is that if the possibility that might go away, how is that impacting your thinking about exchanges, recapture, re-verification, and so forth next year? Is there any contingency either in your bid approach or otherwise that you can put in place, and you're thinking about?\nJoe Zubretsky: AJ it's Joe. Just at a very, very high level we believe that the impact to Molina's marketplace business will more or less reflect what happens nationally. So, if there's 14 plus million members in marketplace today across the industry, estimates have the enhanced subsidies causing an attrition of slightly more than, but just about three million members back down to 11. I also would remind you that there is this family glitch fix that will move the other way. Estimates say that there's five million families in the United States that might at least be eligible. Our view is probably only 20% of that will actually come back into the product. So, fourteen minus three, plus one, maybe it's a $12 million membership portfolio nationally. And we believe our \u2013 we have no reason to believe that our membership will react any differently than that. Look, it's an important product in the portfolio because we consider it to be an adjunct of Medicaid, not only operationally, but strategically. And I think when these members redetermined this year, it's going to be the proof point that if we can warm transfer them into a marketplace product and enjoy their membership for another year or two, then it's position in the portfolio is validated. We like it at 7% of revenue at $2 billion. Maybe that flex is up and down here with these two, industry phenomenon you described. But our goal is to maintain this business at mid-single digit margins. And we will let the revenue flex up and down with the goal of hitting mid-single digit pretax margins.\nA. J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Wanted to stick on the market a place and get your guys\u2019 perspectives just on the sort of broader under [indiscernible].\nJoe Krocheski: I'm sorry. We have experienced a technical difficulty here. If you were in a question queue, could you please re-queue? I will unmute Scott Fidel\u2019s line in just a moment, Scott Fidel you are unmuted now.\nScott Fidel: Okay. Thanks. We'll I guess we'll try it again. Hey, good morning. Just wanted to ask about your thoughts on the underwriting cycle in the exchange market that we've seen in the last couple years had considerably more capacity coming into the market, some of that pretty irrational in terms of some of the pricing strategies. And just trying to think about sort of where we're sitting in that dynamic heading into 2023, we've seen one of the most aggressive players in the market already talk about pulling back from a number of their state footprints and clearly losses for several of these [indiscernible] have gotten pretty extreme right over the last year or two. So just interested in how you guys are thinking about the competitive dynamic for the exchange market for 2023. And maybe how that presents itself around some of your strategy around pricing and growth for next year?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure Scott, and then I'll kick it to Mark for color. But as [indiscernible] repeating the strategy is this is an adjunct to Medicaid. It leverages the Medicaid network. And it's a residual market for people that are no longer eligible for Medicaid, but still need subsidies to afford healthcare. We follow our Medicaid foot. So, the strategy is very, very well understood here at the company. And the financial profile again, bears repeating. We will allow revenue to flex up and down, whether it's trend related, whether it's new CMS rules related or whether it's competitive forces, we will let revenue flex up and down with the goal of maintaining this business at mid-single-digit margins, given that the financial complexity of it is, it's more complex than the other products we have in the portfolio.\nMark Keim: Scott, your question is well placed though with many players not having a great experience with SEP, how will they price going is a really good question. As Joe mentioned, we will clearly prioritize our target margins over volume. As Joe said, revenue will flex up, flex down accordingly. But what I like about our strategy is we're in 14 states and I can't predict who is going to price how in any one of those states. We'll put our best pricing out at our target margins. And with the diversification of 14 states, I can't predict any one of them, but across those states we'll be well positioned in some maybe less competitive in others. But we should have a pretty good portfolio outcome at the target margins we're shooting for.\nScott Fidel: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: Yes, hi. Thanks for the question. So, it's been a while since the 50% Medicaid retention figure was introduced, I was hoping you could give us a reminder of what your analysis just looks at to arrive at that figure? And then maybe some context about what metrics you're monitoring. Essentially the question is why or why not has this metric changed as a result of the really strong employment market that we're seeing in subsequent quarters and some significant improving the employment levels there? Thank you.\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure. Stephen I'll make some preliminary [ph] comments and then kick it to Mark. One of the things we like to remind people when they look at our 50% retention assumption, our membership organically grew approximately 25% since the beginning of the pandemic. If we say we're going to keep half of it that implies a growth rate net of attrition of about 12%. I think what a lot of us forget is that during the period of time if the pandemic never happened, the Medicaid roles will have grown or would have grown anyway, just due the natural growth in the population of the U.S., particularly at the end of the economy, the low wage service end of the economy. So, in our view, the amount of membership we're going to retain from the organic growth during the pandemic is not that much more greater than the natural growth that the industry would have experienced since beginning of the pandemic. Now I'll kick it to Mark about how we went state by state, and really try to drill down and understand the microeconomic effects in each state in order to arrive at our estimate.\nMark Keim: Great. As Joe mentioned since the start of the pandemic, we've organically grown about 25%. If we're going to keep to that, that's about 12%. And if you look at the four or five years that that whole cycle takes, that's growth rate of 2%, 3% a year which is probably organically what Medicaid might have grown at anyway. So, arguably you are right back to where you were if there hadn't been a pandemic. Now, when we look bottoms up and we look at any given state where those members came from, that are in our increased roles, a good component of it is what's sometimes referred to as the woodwork effect, the people that were previously uncovered, but because of the pandemic realized it's a great time to come into the Medicaid pool and get covered, they're certainly going to stay with us. Every time we see a crisis like this the roles of Medicaid move up and never quite go back to where they were. So, at a bare minimum, that woodwork effect will account for some of the increase. And again, over the four to five years, arguably you might be where you were without a pandemic coming out of it, just on normal growth rates.\nJoe Zubretsky: And Steven, I also point to even though the unemployment rate national averages really don't mean a whole lot you have to actually look state by state and look at the low wage service economy. That's been ravaged by the economic distress that we're experiencing here in the U.S. That combined with the reservation wage, the wage at which people want to go back to work has increased dramatically. And of course, the great resignation with people just hesitant to go back to work due to other factors. So, the environment in this population certainly suggests that post-pandemic the Medicaid roles will be higher than they were pre-pandemic.\nOperator: The next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Yes, good morning. And thanks for taking the question. I guess so this is kind of a broad-based question, but can you talk about how your rate discussions are going with states as you guys contemplate and think about inflation? And maybe just talk a little bit about how Molina kind of sees self-exposed to inflation is clearly a wage pressure internally. Like to what degree does providers wanting exact price kind of take a toll in your book if at all given the Medicaid population? And just like, I ask this question, selfishly, internally, we talked a time about inflation here. We just love to think about how you guys are thinking about inflation impacting kind of your business. And I'd probably ask you to focus on kind of like the ways that might not be obvious, like basically aside from wage pressure.\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure. Yes, I'll answer the second part first, because it bears repeating. Clearly, it's been harder to keep our capacity filled and this is industry wide hiring has been very, very difficult. And people are feeling the inflation pressures. And we noted some additional contract labor costs and some additional overtime costs in the first quarter. And people are feeling the stress of the pandemic. We feel that we've been very fair with our population and given them adequate merit increases to key pace with inflation. But we continue to monitor it. Right now, we see no unusual trend or outlook for our labor costs internally. Our biggest challenge is keeping the seats filled and making sure that we never disappoint a customer because we lack the capacity to service the volume. On the medical cost side, we're not seeing it. Now bear in mind the basis, the chassis for our reimbursement is the Medicaid fee schedule. And we're not seeing any dramatic shifts in the Medicaid fee schedules coming out from states. Now, you\u2019ll also negotiate individually a percentage of that Medicaid fee schedule with the individual providers, whether they are physician groups or hospitals. And we're seeing no additional pressure there either. I will tell you that we are comfortable that if we do start to see the inflationary pressures, the real question is, does the rating process keep pace with that? And we believe the answer is yes. States are very much in tune with the trends in medical cost and as are their actuaries. And if we start to see inflationary pressures, the real question is will rates respond? And we believe the answer is yes, they will.\nGeorge Hill: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Thanks for taking the question. I guess my question will be on Medicare Advantage then this morning, the membership growth remains very strong. I was wondering if you could just speak to where those adds are coming about geographically and from where are they all coming from fee-for-service or competitors. And then just on the yields, it looks like the yields were relatively flat. So, I'm trying to figure out if that's product or geography mix or something else. And I just would have expected a little bit of inflation with risk adjusters. So curious if those were not as additive as expected.\nJoe Zubretsky: Well, Josh, our Medicare business is growing nicely. And of course, the margins don't get any better than this. It's a low income, high acuity strategy, MMP anti-SNP and in our MAPD launch, we clearly end the aim, the MAPD product at low-income individual. So, it's a low-income, high-acuity strategy. We grew 6,000 in a quarter up to 148. Some of came in through the Cigna acquisition and the MAPD launch was very, very successful. We have three distribution channels. We have an external broker channel, independent broker channel, captive agent channel and a tele-sales channel. And they are all really working hard to and have increased their productivity here over the last year under new leadership that we have in our distribution channel strategy. So, it's growing very nicely. I mean, the yields are in line with our expectation. Look at the margins in the business at an 85.6% or 86.5% MCR for the quarter and an outlook to be at the bottom end of our long-term target range. And the rate increase that we're getting for next year. We believe our product is competitive, it has all the ancillary services that we allow it to be competitive. Our star ratings are good enough that we can maintain these margins. And we're very, very bullish on the growth prospects of this business over time. We plan to grow it to 158,000 to the end of the year, which would be 10,000 growth just inside of the year.\nOperator: We have no further questions. So, this concludes our question-and-answer session, which also concludes today's conference call. Thank you very much for attending and you may not disconnect.",

            "name": "Mark Keim",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I will discuss some additional details of our first quarter performance. I will then turn to the balance sheet and some thoughts on our 2022 guidance. Beginning with some detailed commentary of out our first quarter results, the total company net effective COVID reduced net income by $0.57 per share and added 50 basis points to the consolidated MCR. This result was largely consistent with our expectations. However, the impact varied by lines of business with minimal impact on Medicaid and larger impacts on marketplace and Medicare. In Medicaid our reported MCR was 88.1%, a strong result that was in-line with our long-term target. For the quarter the net effective COVID was a modest 10 basis point increase to our reported MCR as the high volume of inpatient stays and COVID related corridors we're largely offset by curtailment of utilization. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 86.5% better than our long-term target. During the quarter, the net effect of COVID increased our reported MCR by 190 basis points. This pressure was more than offset by favorable risk adjustment and product mix. In marketplace our reported MCR was 78.6%, this result was in line with our long-term target despite absorbing 270 basis points of net effect of COVID. Our reported MCR was also influenced by our strategy of focusing on silver products, which experienced less MCR seasonality than bronze products due to lower deductibles. Silver members, as a percent of our book increased from approximately 50% in the first quarter of 2021 to 75% in the first quarter of 2022. Additionally renewal members now comprised two-thirds of our membership, up from one-third last year. These factors combined with a more limited SEP in 2022 give us continued confidence in restoring margins to our mid-single digit target in 2022. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7.1%, reflecting increased temporary of labor costs due to industry-wide hiring challenges and some one-time items. We expect our full year 2022 G&A ratio to be consistent with our long-term target. Turning now to our balance sheet: Our capital foundation remained strong. We harvested $115 million of some bestiary dividends in the quarter and our quarter-end parent company cash balance was $250 million. Debt at the end of the quarter was 2.1 times trailing 12-month EBITDA. Our debt-to-cap ratio is 46.3%. However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.8 times and 43.5% respectively. These metrics reflect a conservative leverage position and ample cash capacity for additional growth and investment. Turning to reserves: Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and we continue to be confident in our reserve position. Days and claims payable at the end of the quarter was flat sequentially at 51 days of medical cost expense. Finally, a few comments on guidance. We have increased our 2022 adjusted earnings guidance to no less than $17.10 per share. We continue to project slightly more than half of the year's earnings in the first two quarters. In addition, we have increased our view of embedded earnings by $0.25 to $2.75 per share. The increase is driven by the higher net effect of COVID we are now expecting this year, partly offset by moderately higher impact from redetermination that we expect next year stemming from the extension of the public health emergency. As a reminder, this embedded earnings power does not represent 2023 guidance, but rather an accounting of drivers that are temporarily suppressing our earnings profile, and our current projection of the impact of Medicaid redeterminations post 2022. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Yes, that's exactly right, Joe. The answer is both within the quarter all three lines of business were in \u2013 within the long-term guidance. In fact, Medicare was better and they're all tracking to be squarely in the middle of long-term guidance on a full year basis and of course that's reflected in our full year guidance Operator? Yes. And just to build on Joe's comments, clearly in Q1 we saw higher net effective COVID as a percentage or in the MCR in Medicare and marketplace. As Joe mentioned the increase of $0.50 across the rest of the year really about some certainties and some conservativism about the outlook for the cost of COVID in-patient in the related curtailment. Where that might manifest? We've typically seen a little more in Medicare and marketplace, but it can move around among the lines of business but I think that's a pretty good overview of our outlook. That's right, Justin. So as Joe mentioned, guidance is smack in the middle of the range, 3.3% is in the middle of the range of 3% to 3.7%, so next year that's $2.75 is certainly upside. The flip side as we grow our business, we stack on M&A, we add new procurements. Those tend to come in a little lower in margin in the early years, and you've always got the impact of organic. So what we always say is it's certainly not guidance. It's just an accounting of some of the things that are depressing earnings this year. There'll be other things to add in next year, but it's certainly a good tailwind into 2023. Joe, I think you hit the key points there. The only thing Michael that you also asked about is just the timing of them coming over from redetermination to marketplace, that'll vary. In certain places we have really good operations to proactively reach out to people, help them with their redetermination and to the extent they lose Medicaid eligibility, immediately get them signed up in marketplace. In other cases, members may fall off and after a month or two come back on. So I think state-by-state as the rules slightly vary exactly how those transitions work will vary as well, but I think you've hit the big points. Scott, your question is well placed though with many players not having a great experience with SEP, how will they price going is a really good question. As Joe mentioned, we will clearly prioritize our target margins over volume. As Joe said, revenue will flex up, flex down accordingly. But what I like about our strategy is we're in 14 states and I can't predict who is going to price how in any one of those states. We'll put our best pricing out at our target margins. And with the diversification of 14 states, I can't predict any one of them, but across those states we'll be well positioned in some maybe less competitive in others. But we should have a pretty good portfolio outcome at the target margins we're shooting for. Great. As Joe mentioned since the start of the pandemic, we've organically grown about 25%. If we're going to keep to that, that's about 12%. And if you look at the four or five years that that whole cycle takes, that's growth rate of 2%, 3% a year which is probably organically what Medicaid might have grown at anyway. So, arguably you are right back to where you were if there hadn't been a pandemic. Now, when we look bottoms up and we look at any given state where those members came from, that are in our increased roles, a good component of it is what's sometimes referred to as the woodwork effect, the people that were previously uncovered, but because of the pandemic realized it's a great time to come into the Medicaid pool and get covered, they're certainly going to stay with us. Every time we see a crisis like this the roles of Medicaid move up and never quite go back to where they were. So, at a bare minimum, that woodwork effect will account for some of the increase. And again, over the four to five years, arguably you might be where you were without a pandemic coming out of it, just on normal growth rates."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Joe Zubretsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe. And good morning. Today, we will provide you with updates on several topics: our financial results for the first quarter 2022; our full year 2022 guidance in the context of our first quarter results and our growth initiatives and the reaffirmation of our strategy for sustaining profitable growth.  Let me start with the first quarter highlights. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of $4.90 with adjusted net income of $288 million. First quarter premium revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $7.5 billion, driven by strong membership gains in Medicaid and Medicare. Our 87.1% consolidated MCR in the first quarter is squarely in line with our long-term target range and demonstrates strong operating performance even as we continue to navigate pandemic-related challenges. In the quarter, the net effective COVID increased our consolidated MCR by approximately 50 basis points, decreasing net per diluted share by approximately $0.57. Within the net effect of COVID inpatient COVID costs in the quarter were the highest since the beginning of the pandemic, surging in the month of January and then steadily subsiding throughout the quarter. These costs were mostly off by COVID related utilization, curtailment and effective medical cost management. Despite the continued pandemic-related impact, we produced an adjusted after-tax margin of 3.7%, a very strong result that is at the high end of our long-term target range and consistent with normal seasonal patterns. Turning now to highlights by line of business. In Medicaid, we ended the quarter with approximately 4.6 million members an increase of approximately 700,000 or 18% year-over-year. This strong performance drove 24% Medicaid premium revenue growth year over year. Increased membership was the balanced result of our recent acquisitions and organic gains supported by the redetermination pause. In the first quarter, we continued to generate excellent margins in our Medicaid business with a medical care ratio at 88.1%, which is in line with our long-term target. The enduring highlights of our flagship Medicaid business are as follows. Our diversified portfolio of 18 state contracts provides for excellent distribution of risk related to rate setting and contract reprocurements, actuarially sound rates prevail, and the rate setting process establishes a credible medical cost baseline with forward trend and benefit changes. Poor medical cost trends remain stable and well controlled. The few remaining COVID risk-sharing corridors continue to capture some of our outperformance, but we expect these to be eliminated over time. And we continue to execute our growth strategy. Our in-state market shares are large enough to be relevant to our state customers, yet small enough to support significant growth opportunity. In Medicare, we ended the quarter with 148,000 members or 17% growth year-over-year, with related premium revenue growth of 18%. Our performance was driven primarily by organic gains and our D-SNP and MAPD products as we continue to increase our market share and our existing footprint and expand geographically to match our Medicaid footprint. Our reported Medicare MCR was very strong on the quarter at 86.5%, which is below the low end of our long-term target range, even after absorbing 190 basis points of COVID-related pressure. In marketplace we ended the quarter with 371,000 members. This result is higher than previously projected, driven by higher-than-expected effectuation rates during the later stages of open enrollment. The declines in membership and premium from prior year are consistent with our previously communicated strategy to reposition the book of business and its risk profile. Our marketplace business is now more appropriately sized in the overall portfolio. Our first quarter marketplace MCR was 78.6%. This result is in line with our long-term target, even after absorbing 270 basis points of COVID-related pressure and reflects the successful implementation of our strategy to restore this business to target margins. As Mark will discuss in a moment, the favorable mix of renewal membership and the silver-tier products, gives us great confidence that we will achieve our 2022 margin goal. In summary 2022 is off to a very strong start. Medicaid, our flagship business, representing 80% of revenue, continues to produce strong, predictable operating results, and cash flow.  Our high acuity Medicare niche serving low-income members continues to grow organically and exceeded our long-term target margins. In marketplace a complimentary product in our government subsidized strategy is now well-positioned for success at 7% of total company premium revenue. Turning now to our 2022 guidance, beginning with premium revenue. We now project premium revenue to be approximately $29.25 billion or approximately $750 million above our previous guidance. Our revenue growth rates are consistent with our long-term targets. Specifically, our updated premium revenue guidance now includes approximately $400 million of additional Medicaid revenue resulting from the extension of the public health emergency from April to July and the associated suspension of membership redeterminations. Approximately $100 million of marketplace revenue resulting from stronger open enrollment as we now expect to end 2022 with approximately 270,000 members. And approximately $250 million related to state-based passthrough revenue payments. As in the past, we have excluded from our premium revenue guidance, any impact of the AgeWell acquisition, which we expect to close in the third quarter of this year. Turning now to earnings guidance: We are increasing our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance to know less than $17.10. Specifically our increased 2022 earnings guidance reflects the favorable impacts of strong first quarter performance, underlying strength in the business in the rest of the year, the margin associated with the increase in our premium revenue, the combination of which is largely offset by a $0.50 per share increase in projected net effect of COVID. We have remained cautious in forecasting utilization trends in the remaining nine months of the year. Due to the uncertainties of COVID, and related utilization curtailment as well as core medical cost trend we believe at the end of the second quarter our membership will have seasoned enough to allow us to fine tune our forecast of COVID related medical cost and core medical cost trend. We are confident in our 2022 outlook that features revenue growth rates consistent with our long-term targets, and after tax margin at the midpoint of our long-term guidance range and strong earnings per share growth of 26%. Turning now to an update on our strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Building on our momentum from last year, we are off to a strong start in 2022. Based on our past track record, we are confident in successfully retaining the Medicaid contract that are currently in a procurement process. Our RFP responses have been submitted in Mississippi and California and are pending evaluation and subsequent award announcement. The Texas STAR+PLUS RFP has been issued by the state and our response is currently being developed. We have a high degree of confidence in retaining these contracts as a result of our operational and clinical excellence, standing and reputation, innovation and the demonstrated ability to write winning proposals. At the beginning of the year we successfully launched our Medicaid plan in Nevada, adding a new state to our footprint and 125,000 members. With multiple RFP opportunities over the coming years, we remain confident in our ability to win additional new state contracts. We have one new state proposal pending in Rhode Island and many other new state business development opportunities well in process. Our M&A platform continues to execute at a high level. On January 1st, we closed on the acquisition of Cigna's Texas Medicaid business, deepening our service offerings in the state and adding 44,000 high acuity members. Our acquired businesses are achieving or exceeding their earnings accretion targets. The pipeline of acquisition opportunities remains robust. We are confident in our ability to drive continued value from this important dimension of our growth strategy. The company's performance continues to validate our long-term strategy and its value creation and potential. We can and will grow the top line at 13% to 15% per year on average over time by a combination of market share gains, new contract wins, footprint expansion and of course bolt-on M&A. We can achieve this growth and maintain pre-tax margins in the range of 4Tto 5%. Rates are stable and our effectiveness at medical cost management while ensuring optimum quality has been consistently demonstrated. A number of external factors are combining to support government sponsored healthcare. In particular demographics, economic disruptions and political priorities are working together to generate meaningful tailwinds for the industry. And finally, our strong cash flow generation gives us ample capacity to invest in new capabilities and acquisitions. Our strategy is sound validated with each quarter's performance and will continue to be valued creating. As I conclude my remarks, I want to express my continued gratitude to our management team and to our nearly 14,000 Molina colleagues, their skill, dedication and steadfast service form the foundation for everything we have achieved and everything we will achieve in the years to come. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Keim for some additional color on the financials. Mark? Hi Ben, this is Joe. The marketplace business is now perfectly positioned to achieve our mid-single digit pre-tax margin target for the year. I will tell you it's very difficult to make comparisons year-over-year given the substantial mix shift that we orchestrated from 2021 to 2022. So some data points are 78.6% MCR in the quarter was burdened by 270 basis points of COVID \u2013 so on our ex-COVID basis is closer to 76 that will light grow for seasonality during the year modestly. And we believe we'll achieve in the middle of our long-term target range at 79% for the full year. We're confident in that, as Marc said in the prepared remarks because of the mix of renewal membership versus new membership, which is now two-third renewal, one-third new. The mix of silver versus bronze, which is now 75/15 and last year it was 55/45 and the fact that the SEP period last year took all comers. There were no income cutoffs and this year we believe the eligible population for SEP has been basically reduced by half due to the limitation on income to 150% of FPL. So year-over-year comparisons are very, very difficult given the dramatic orchestrated shift in the book. The business is now very, very well positioned to achieve our mid annual digit pretax margin for the full year. Sure. Kevin, it's Joe, and then I'll kick it to Mark. Yes, there is some modest seasonality to the business. In fact, I would say that the seasonality and marketplace is much more dampen than it has in the past due to the higher silver mix that we have one data two. The answer to your question is both, we're hitting our long-term targets both on the quarter and we expect to hit them for the full year, although there's 70 to 90 basis points of seasonality from the front end of the year to the back end of the year. Mark? Hi, Steven, it's Joe, and then I'll kick it to Mark for some additional color. The net effect of COVID was slightly higher than our expectations in the quarter. I remind everyone that we calculate or estimate the net effect of COVID as being the direct inpatient cost of COVID related care offset by an estimate of what we believe to be utilization curtailment due to the pandemic. And furthermore the effect of our outperformance in the states that continued to carry the COVID related corridors forward. That's how we calculate the impact. For the most part in the recent past we've seen the direct cost of COVID related care, which were very significant in the quarter. It surged in January and was significantly reduced in both February and March, pretty much offset by curtailment, not totally but pretty much. And then of course our outperformance, which we continue to enjoy in the states that have carried for the corridors, continues to be captured by the corridors. So it was a little higher than expected and the reason we increased our estimate for the full year is you're never completely comfortable that curtailment will always be a direct offset to COVID related care. And to the extent it doesn't, we wanted to be conservative with our outlook for the year. Sure. Justin, its Joe, and then I'll turn to Mark for some color. But we are operating in the first quarter given the seasonality of the business, at the high end of our margin range we produced an after tax margin of 3.7% on a pretax margin of 4.9%. For the year, as I just suggested with the MCR seasonality commentary that that will moderate to where we estimate in our full year guidance of pretax margin of approximately 4.4% and 3.3% after tax in the middle of the range. So yes, if you then take embedded earnings purely without any other puts and takes for future forecasting and guidance; it would bring you higher in the range, which is entirely possible. But as you suggest our embedded earnings guidance is not a forecast. Our embedded earnings estimate is not a forecast and is not guidance. And yes, it could move us the top end of the range or act as a buffer against other things that we need to forecast in the future. Sure, Nathan. The first thing I would say is when I say it subsided during the quarter, it did so dramatically. Our COVID direct cost of care in January were the highest since the beginning of the pandemic. In February those costs were cut to one-third of the January actual and in March cut yet another one-third in March off of February, a dramatic decline. But the BAQ was out there and while the infection rate is high, the severity and the treatment protocols are actually quite light. However, we never know whether it's going to resurge and we wanted to be as you suggested cautious with our outlook for COVID, particularly because in the recent past utilization curtailment has nearly offset the entire direct cost of cover related care. We never have full assurance that that will continue. Our second point, on what we call core medical cost trend, just the routine of cranking up our medical economics engine and truly understanding all the different dimensions of medical costs. We saw nothing in the quarter that surprised us or was unusual. All the things that you've read about and are being reported on where orthopedic procedures coming back with joint replacements, the ambulatory and outpatient settings are back in business, and we're seeing an uptick, but nothing unusual. We see spikes in pharmacy costs here and there; as some of our state single preferred drug lists sometimes promote the use of branded drugs. So nothing unusual and nothing surprising. It's the normal many inflection points here and there, but we wanted to remain cautious. We are hopefully on the tail end of the pandemic and we usually are cautious in our medical cost forecasting and want to see Q2 results before we put a better fine tune estimate on it. Well Michael, we always characterize the redetermination phenomenon as when it's going to happen is really just a mathematical exercise of when the membership trips and revenue follows, which fiscal years is it going to hit. And right now it's \u2013 we're going to enjoy that membership and revenue for a longer period of time in 2022, and more of it will fall off in 2023. I think we think the real key point is how much of it persists beyond the redetermination period. And our forecast is that we grew 750,000 even slightly higher than that of organic growth in Medicaid since the beginning of the pandemic, we forecast to retain half of it. We believe the revenue growth associated with that was $2.9 billion, and we'll continue to have $1.6 billion of that when the re-determined processes complete. We also respect because CMS is now given clear guidance and is concerned with people being orphaned without healthcare, that they've made it a lot easier for us to work with our state customers to warm transfer members off of Medicaid if they're no longer eligible into marketplace and or Medicare, and these are products we continually enjoy. So that's sort of the strategy we have operational protocols in place to handle all this. We are concerned with the individual state's ability to handle a tremendous amount of value, 80 million people going through redetermination and re-eligibility inside of one-year is a huge undertaking. But we are really confident in the forecast that we've given on how much membership we will retain and potentially warm transfer into marketplace. Mark anything on the year-over-year comparison? AJ it's Joe. Just at a very, very high level we believe that the impact to Molina's marketplace business will more or less reflect what happens nationally. So, if there's 14 plus million members in marketplace today across the industry, estimates have the enhanced subsidies causing an attrition of slightly more than, but just about three million members back down to 11. I also would remind you that there is this family glitch fix that will move the other way. Estimates say that there's five million families in the United States that might at least be eligible. Our view is probably only 20% of that will actually come back into the product. So, fourteen minus three, plus one, maybe it's a $12 million membership portfolio nationally. And we believe our \u2013 we have no reason to believe that our membership will react any differently than that. Look, it's an important product in the portfolio because we consider it to be an adjunct of Medicaid, not only operationally, but strategically. And I think when these members redetermined this year, it's going to be the proof point that if we can warm transfer them into a marketplace product and enjoy their membership for another year or two, then it's position in the portfolio is validated. We like it at 7% of revenue at $2 billion. Maybe that flex is up and down here with these two, industry phenomenon you described. But our goal is to maintain this business at mid-single digit margins. And we will let the revenue flex up and down with the goal of hitting mid-single digit pretax margins. Sure Scott, and then I'll kick it to Mark for color. But as [indiscernible] repeating the strategy is this is an adjunct to Medicaid. It leverages the Medicaid network. And it's a residual market for people that are no longer eligible for Medicaid, but still need subsidies to afford healthcare. We follow our Medicaid foot. So, the strategy is very, very well understood here at the company. And the financial profile again, bears repeating. We will allow revenue to flex up and down, whether it's trend related, whether it's new CMS rules related or whether it's competitive forces, we will let revenue flex up and down with the goal of maintaining this business at mid-single-digit margins, given that the financial complexity of it is, it's more complex than the other products we have in the portfolio. Sure. Stephen I'll make some preliminary [ph] comments and then kick it to Mark. One of the things we like to remind people when they look at our 50% retention assumption, our membership organically grew approximately 25% since the beginning of the pandemic. If we say we're going to keep half of it that implies a growth rate net of attrition of about 12%. I think what a lot of us forget is that during the period of time if the pandemic never happened, the Medicaid roles will have grown or would have grown anyway, just due the natural growth in the population of the U.S., particularly at the end of the economy, the low wage service end of the economy. So, in our view, the amount of membership we're going to retain from the organic growth during the pandemic is not that much more greater than the natural growth that the industry would have experienced since beginning of the pandemic. Now I'll kick it to Mark about how we went state by state, and really try to drill down and understand the microeconomic effects in each state in order to arrive at our estimate. And Steven, I also point to even though the unemployment rate national averages really don't mean a whole lot you have to actually look state by state and look at the low wage service economy. That's been ravaged by the economic distress that we're experiencing here in the U.S. That combined with the reservation wage, the wage at which people want to go back to work has increased dramatically. And of course, the great resignation with people just hesitant to go back to work due to other factors. So, the environment in this population certainly suggests that post-pandemic the Medicaid roles will be higher than they were pre-pandemic. Sure. Yes, I'll answer the second part first, because it bears repeating. Clearly, it's been harder to keep our capacity filled and this is industry wide hiring has been very, very difficult. And people are feeling the inflation pressures. And we noted some additional contract labor costs and some additional overtime costs in the first quarter. And people are feeling the stress of the pandemic. We feel that we've been very fair with our population and given them adequate merit increases to key pace with inflation. But we continue to monitor it. Right now, we see no unusual trend or outlook for our labor costs internally. Our biggest challenge is keeping the seats filled and making sure that we never disappoint a customer because we lack the capacity to service the volume. On the medical cost side, we're not seeing it. Now bear in mind the basis, the chassis for our reimbursement is the Medicaid fee schedule. And we're not seeing any dramatic shifts in the Medicaid fee schedules coming out from states. Now, you'll also negotiate individually a percentage of that Medicaid fee schedule with the individual providers, whether they are physician groups or hospitals. And we're seeing no additional pressure there either. I will tell you that we are comfortable that if we do start to see the inflationary pressures, the real question is, does the rating process keep pace with that? And we believe the answer is yes. States are very much in tune with the trends in medical cost and as are their actuaries. And if we start to see inflationary pressures, the real question is will rates respond? And we believe the answer is yes, they will. Well, Josh, our Medicare business is growing nicely. And of course, the margins don't get any better than this. It's a low income, high acuity strategy, MMP anti-SNP and in our MAPD launch, we clearly end the aim, the MAPD product at low-income individual. So, it's a low-income, high-acuity strategy. We grew 6,000 in a quarter up to 148. Some of came in through the Cigna acquisition and the MAPD launch was very, very successful. We have three distribution channels. We have an external broker channel, independent broker channel, captive agent channel and a tele-sales channel. And they are all really working hard to and have increased their productivity here over the last year under new leadership that we have in our distribution channel strategy. So, it's growing very nicely. I mean, the yields are in line with our expectation. Look at the margins in the business at an 85.6% or 86.5% MCR for the quarter and an outlook to be at the bottom end of our long-term target range. And the rate increase that we're getting for next year. We believe our product is competitive, it has all the ancillary services that we allow it to be competitive. Our star ratings are good enough that we can maintain these margins. And we're very, very bullish on the growth prospects of this business over time. We plan to grow it to 158,000 to the end of the year, which would be 10,000 growth just inside of the year."

After completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?\nJoe Zubretsky: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Today, I will discuss several topics. Our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, our growth initiatives and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth, our 2024 premium revenue and earnings guidance and an affirmation of our long-term growth targets. Let me start with our fourth quarter performance. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.38 on $8.4 billion of premium revenue. Our fourth quarter results and performance metrics demonstrated strong medical cost management and operating cost discipline. Medicaid continued to perform well, withstanding the impacts of the unprecedented redetermination process. Medicare experienced higher than target medical costs, consistent with prior quarters and Marketplace performed very well despite the late in-year medical cost seasonality typically experienced. Our fourth quarter completes a strong year of operating and financial performance. Full year adjusted earnings per share of $20.88 represents 17% year-over-year growth, squarely in line with our long-term target range of 15% to 18% and 6% above our initial 2023 guidance of at least $19.75. Our full year premium revenue of $32.5 billion represents 5% year-over-year growth, and our pretax margin of 4.8% is at the high end of our long-term target range heading into 2024. In Medicaid, our flagship business representing over 80% of revenue, we reported an 88.7% MCR for the full year, which is within our long-term target range. Throughout the redetermination process, we have managed through a number of factors that shape Medicaid's performance, all to land the full year result at a solid jump-off point into 2024. These factors included medical cost utilization, various state corridors and MLR minimums and prospective rate changes. In Medicare, the full year MCR was 90.7%. While the business is profitable, we did not meet our performance expectations due to higher utilization of supplemental benefits, in-home services and high-cost drugs. I am confident that our 2024 bid strategy, adjustments to benefit design and various operational improvements will return the business to target margins in 2024. In Marketplace, we reported a 75.3% MCR for the full year, below the low end of our target range, which reflects the successful execution of our small, silver and stable strategy. This business is now positioned to grow at a rate, which allows us to sustain mid-single-digit margins. In addition to delivering strong financial results, in 2023, we continued to execute on our profitable growth strategy. To recap the growth milestones achieved in 2023. In January, we successfully reprocured our contract in Texas for the state's STAR+PLUS program, retaining all eight regions and likely growing market share. In July, we successfully launched our Iowa Medicaid plan following the RFP, which we had won in a highly competitive process in late 2022. In August, we announced that we were awarded a contract to once again serve Medicaid beneficiaries in the state of New Mexico. In September, we closed on the My Choice Wisconsin acquisition, further expanding our market-leading LTSS franchise. In June, we agreed to acquire Bright Health's California Medicare business, which we have now closed effective January 1, 2024. Also effective January 1 and after another win in a highly competitive bid process, we successfully launched our Nebraska health plan. And finally, on January 1, we launched our expanded California platform, including Los Angeles County, which doubled the size of our business in the state. Collectively, these acquisitions and RFP successes represent $7 billion of annual premium revenue, a portion of which was in our 2023 results, most of which is in our 2024 guidance and all of which will be fully realized in 2025. To say we are pleased with the execution of our 2023 growth initiatives would be an understatement. But the growth story doesn't stop there. The pipeline of opportunities, fueling our future growth trajectory is extremely strong. Let me begin with reprocurements. We have submitted our RFP responses for contract renewals in Florida, Virginia and Michigan. We are proven partners with all three of these states, and we are confident in our ability to retain and grow these relationships. With regard to new state opportunities, including the Florida opportunity just described, there is over $50 billion of total premium revenue opportunity, active or near term, up for bid in several states over the coming years. We have already submitted bids in the states of Kansas and Georgia. With our demonstrated capabilities and referenceable track record, we remain confident in our ability to continue to win new state contracts. With respect to our M&A initiatives, our acquisition pipeline remains robust with actionable opportunities and we are confident in our ability to deliver growth from this key component of our strategy. Since 2019, we have completed eight transactions having acquired over $11 billion of premium for which we paid 22% of revenue. This capital allocation to M&A will continue to be a value driver. Turning now to our 2024 guidance. We project 2024 premium revenue of approximately $38 billion, which is consistent with our previous outlook and represents 17% year-over-year growth. We project 2024 adjusted earnings per share of at least $23.50, representing 13% year-over-year growth. Mark will take you through the detailed guidance build in a few minutes. But in the meantime, let me offer some high-level commentary. Our projected premium revenue growth to $38 billion represents a well-balanced combination of new contract wins, acquisitions and growth in our current footprint, partially offset by the impact of Medicaid redeterminations. With respect to earnings guidance in the core business, in Medicaid, our guidance fully considers the impact of the redetermination process. From a margin perspective, this is playing out as we have predicted. The impact of acuity shifts is real, but not significant. The risk corridors acted as a financial buffer and rates prospective and retrospective are largely capturing the trend impact. On a same-store basis, we are projecting the 2024 Medicaid MCR to be within our long-term range. We expect Medicare to return to mid-single-digit profitability in 2024 as a result of our bid strategy, adjustments to benefit design and operational improvements in the legacy business. Our Marketplace product has been priced right, is competitively positioned and the risk pool has stabilized. We expect the business to achieve mid to high single-digit margins, membership to grow over 30% and revenue to grow 17%. On top of our 2024 earnings per share guidance of at least $23.50, we now have $4 per share of new store embedded earnings, which, as you may recall, represents the expected accretion produced by our new store growth. Mark will review the components of the updated $4 per share in his remarks. Our confidence in our 2024 guidance starts with a high-quality 2023 earnings baseline and then takes a thorough account of all the various factors, exogenous and company-specific, that could impact earnings in 2024. Now, a few comments on our longer-term trajectory. Our 2024 guidance picture is one more data point that validates our long-term targets of 13% to 15% premium growth and 15% to 18% adjusted earnings per share growth. We committed to these targets at our Investor Day last May, and we reaffirm that commitment today. With the majority of the $4 of new store embedded earnings expected to emerge in 2025, we already see a clear outlook to achieving the low end of our long-term EPS growth target in 2025, even before considering the execution of additional growth initiatives and driving growth from our current footprint. In summary, we are very pleased with our 2023 performance, our trajectory to deliver the growth and profitability inherent in our 2024 guidance and the embedded earnings outlook we provided for 2025. Our confidence in continuing to achieve our long-term targets is data-driven as demonstrated by the following historical fact set. We have reprocured approximately $12 billion in existing revenue. We have added approximately $7 billion of new revenue through wins of new or expanded contracts in seven states. From 2020 to 2023, we achieved 21% annual premium growth and 25% annual earnings per share growth. 2024 guidance, 17% premium revenue growth year-over-year, 13% earnings per share growth year-over-year. And for 2025, and we expect to harvest the majority of our $4 per share of embedded earnings. Our strategy is clear and simple. We are in the business of providing access to high-quality health care for individuals relying on government assistance. Our business model is also clear and simple. We take on capitated risk, take or make rates that are commensurate with medical cost trends, and manage those trends to consistently achieve our target margins while maintaining higher standards of quality. The execution of our strategy and business model has been and will continue to be strong which is why we look to the future with a great deal of confidence. In conclusion, I want to extend my special thanks to our 19,000 associates who are dedicated to delivering access to high-quality healthcare to our members. It is my privilege to serve with such a committed and capable group of professionals. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark?\nMark Keim: Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss some additional details on our fourth quarter and full year performance, the balance sheet redeterminations and our 2024 guidance. Beginning with our fourth quarter and full year results. For the quarter, we reported $9 billion in total revenue and $8.4 billion of premium revenue. I will note that total revenue includes approximately $380 million in reimbursement for our California MCO tax item that was retrospective to April. This item modestly distorts our reported G&A and margin ratios, but has no net economic consequence. On a consolidated basis, our fourth quarter MCR was 89.1% and our full year was 88.1%, reflecting continued strong medical cost management. Our full year consolidated MCR was consistent with our expectations and squarely in line with our long-term target range. In Medicaid, our fourth quarter reported MCR was 89.2%. The MCR included a moderate impact from the net effect of redetermination acuity shifts and corridors in several states, as well as some MCR pressure from the additions of our Iowa health plan and our My Choice acquisition. Across our Medicaid segment, the major medical cost categories were largely in line with our expectations and normal quarter-to-quarter trend fluctuations. Our full year Medicaid MCR was 88.7%, within our long-term target range and consistent with our expectations. In Medicare, our fourth quarter reported MCR was 93.3% and our full year was 90.7%, both above our long-term target range and impacted by increased utilization of supplemental benefits, in-home services and high-cost drugs. As Joe mentioned, we are confident that our 2024 bid strategy adjustments to benefit design as well as operational improvements will produce target margins in our Medicare business in 2024. In Marketplace, our reported fourth quarter MCR was 79.8%, reflecting our continued success in returning this business to target margins. Our full year Marketplace MCR of 75.3% was well below our long-term target range. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7% as reported. However, when accounting for the California pass-through premium tax item, the ratio restates to 7.3%. This result includes new business implementation spending for new contract wins in California, Nebraska and New Mexico as well as expected seasonal expenditures from Medicare and Marketplace marketing. Our full year adjusted G&A ratio was 7.2%. Recognizing the California tax item in the fourth quarter, the full year G&A ratio restated to 7.3%. Turning to our Bright acquisition. We successfully closed the transaction effective this past January 1, at final price of $425 million net of tax benefits which was lower than our initially announced terms. The acquisition adds 109,000 members and contributes $1.6 billion in premium this year. We acquired the business with a premium deficiency reserve, which is expected to moderate first year losses, but we still expect the acquisition to be approximately $0.50 dilutive to 2024 adjusted EPS. Now that we have owned the business for six weeks, we have increased confidence in our assumption that the Bright acquisition will deliver an ultimate accretion of $1 per share as final run rate margin. Given the expectation of this modest lot in the first year, we are updating the 2024 new store embedded earnings from the Bright acquisition to $1.50 per share, reflecting this $0.50 of first year dilution. Moving on to Medicaid redeterminations. In the quarter, we estimate we lost 200,000 members driven by redeterminations, bringing the full year figure to approximately 500,000. We are now updating our estimate of members gained during the pandemic to 1 million to include new business additions in 2023 and 2024 as well as the legacy business. Given the high rate of procedural disenrollments rather than through verification, we are seeing a nearly 30% reconnect rate, consistent with previous quarters. As reconnects continue, we expect the membership losses just described to restate to a lower level over the coming months. We continue to project ultimately retaining 40% of our updated members gained, which implies a net loss of 600,000 from the redetermination process. The offsetting positive impact from our growth initiatives is significant. We ended 2022 with 4.8 million Medicaid members, and we expect to close out 2024 with 5.1 million members, a net 300,000 member growth over a two-year period, despite the losses from redetermination. Moving to Medicaid rates. We now have visibility into rates impacting approximately 80% of our 2024 premium. All but one of our states have now included an acuity adjustment for redetermination for 2024. We continue to work with our state partners to ensure appropriate rates through the normal rate cycle, retroactive or mid-cycle adjustments given the experience to date. We are confident that the requirement for actuarially sound rates will offset trends as they may emerge. Updated rates and trend assumptions have been considered in the 2024 Medicaid MCR that supports our guidance. Turning to our balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. We harvested approximately $280 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, and our parent company cash balance was approximately $740 million, a portion of which was used to fund the Bright Medicare acquisition just after the first of the year. Debt at the end of the quarter was 1.4 times trailing 12-month EBITDA with our debt-to-cap ratio at 36.3%. These ratios reflect our low leverage position and ample cash and capital capacity for additional growth and investment. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, we are confident in the strength of our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 50. Now some additional details on our 2024 guidance, beginning with membership. In Medicaid, we expect new membership from our recent new contract wins to add approximately 650,000 members. We expect to lose 100,000 members over the remainder of the redetermination process in 2024. The net result in 2024 year-end membership of approximately 5.1 million members or 12% growth year-over-year. In Medicare, the Bright acquisition added 109,000 members. Combined with our legacy business, we expect to end 2024 with 270,000 Medicare members, representing 58% growth year-over-year. In Marketplace, based on open enrollment, we expect to begin 2024 with approximately 320,000 members, representing 14% growth from year-end 2023. We expect growth to continue through the year, boosted by the redetermination conversions and ending with approximately 370,000 members, representing 31% growth year-over-year. We are still 75% silver, which bodes well for medical margin stability. Our 2024 premium revenue guidance is approximately $38 billion, representing 17% growth from 2023. Our revenue growth is comprised of several items, $3.3 billion of revenue tied to our recent RFP wins. To this, we add $2.4 billion of revenue from our recently closed acquisitions, including $1.6 billion from Bright and $800 million from a full year of My Choice Wisconsin. And finally, $1.7 billion of organic growth across Medicaid, Medicare and Marketplace. Partially offsetting these growth drivers is a higher estimated full year impact of $1.9 billion in decreased revenue from redeterminations. Moving on to earnings guidance. We expect 2024 full year adjusted earnings of at least $23.50 per share. Our EPS guidance reflects the realization of approximately $2 per share of 2023 new store embedded earnings, approximately $2 for the underlying organic growth across our current Medicaid and Medicare footprints, the realization of $0.75 benefit from the onetime nonrecurring implementation costs incurred in 2023, partially offset by $1.25 impact from redeterminations and $0.50 impact from the Bright acquisitions first year operating and carrying costs and finally, $0.25 from a conservative view of earnings contribution from investment income. Turning to MCR guidance. Our consolidated Medical Care Ratio is expected to be 88.2%. Our Medicaid MCR is expected to be 89%, at the high end of our long-term target range. This guidance reflects the inclusion of our significant new store growth, which runs at a higher MCR in the first year. Our legacy or same-store Medicaid MCR is expected to fall in the middle of our long-term range. We anticipate our Medicare MCR to be 88%, while at the high end of our long-term target range, the MCR reflects our expected success in our 2024 bid strategy adjustments to benefit design and various operational improvements. For Marketplace, we expect the MCR at the low end of the long-term target MCR range of 78% to 80%. Moving on to select P&L guidance metrics. We expect our adjusted G&A ratio to fall to 7% as new business implementation costs subside, and we leverage the increased scale of our business. Effective tax rate of 25.7%. Adjusted pretax margin of 4.6%, well within our long-term target range. Weighted average share count unchanged at 58.1 million shares. And our quarterly EPS will be weighted slightly heavier towards the second half of the year as we drive improved performance in our new business portfolio additions over the course of the year. Turning to embedded earnings. We ended 2023 with $5.50 per share of new store embedded earnings. Our 2024 guidance includes the realization of $2, resulting in a new base of $3.50. To this, we add $0.50 for the impact of Bright acquisitions first year loss, leaving us with $4 remaining at the end of 2024. We expect the majority of this to emerge in 2025 giving us further confidence in our 15% to 18% long-term growth rate for EPS. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe 2 things. On the Medicare MLR margin, it sounds like you're attributing your improvements you're expecting largely to benefit design changes and operational improvements. Any comment on what you're assuming relative to underlying utilization trends? And then just on the Medicaid, you're sounding like you'll be on the legacy business in the middle of your long term MLR targets. How are you thinking about margin profile coming out of redeterminations? Is there an opportunity for further improvement? Is it steady? Any thoughts on that?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, A.J. With respect to the Medicare MLR question, we have three components of medical costs that ran higher than expectations. One was LTSS hours on the Medicaid side of the MMP business. Second, high-cost drugs. And third, supplemental benefits, vision, dental, cash card, over the counter was a little too richly designed in 2023 to be honest. We pulled back on those benefits in our 2024 product design and bids. We reshaped some of the allowance-based benefits to be more managed, and we're confident that that cost category will come back into line. On LTSS hours on the Medicaid side of the MMP benefit, we know where, we know why, and those corrective actions are in place. And it's not unusual in a soft economy for in-home service hours to increase. So we are very confident in the restoration of our MCRs back to the top end of the range in Medicare to 88% in 2024. You also asked about the Medicaid MLR. And let me frame it this way, and then I'll turn it to Mark. The re-determination process actually unfolded exactly as we had planned and as we had predicted. The acuity shift was noticeable, but it was -- it wasn't dramatic and it wasn't significant, but it was noticeable. And that began to happen as the redetermination process began. We then said, and it occurred, that the first financial cushion would be the corridors, the payments into the corridors that existed in the latter half of 2023. That acted as a financial buffer. In the meantime, as the acuity shift became noticeable to our state partners, they began to introduce rate adjustments to account for the acuity shift. So going into 2024, the rate actions completely compensated for what we call [poor] (ph) medical trend, completely compensated for any acuity shift, and that's why we're able to print an MCR in Medicaid at the high end of the range at 89%, which includes a little bit of pressure from the new business that we put on the books.\nMark Keim: Joe summarized that well. Look, we finished 88.7% in 2023 for Medicaid. And as Joe mentioned, that included a little bit of pressure from the acuity shift from redet, but also as we projected the benefit of some corridors. So really tracking exactly where we expect it. Here in the new year on our legacy book, trend roughly equals the rates that we're getting from our state partners. So on our legacy book into \u201824, we're roughly seeing about a flat MLR versus where we finished 2023. Now, why are we at an 89% in guidance? Just as Joe mentioned, we're adding significant new store business through both our acquisitions and a number of big wins. Whenever we have new store go into our portfolio, it tends to be a little bit hotter in the first year on an MLR. So we're seeing a pretty much flat carryover on legacy, a little bit of increased pressure on new store. That's how you get to that 89% that we have in our guidance.\nA.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: The next question comes from Cal Sternick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nCal Sternick: Yeah, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about the Marketplace. It sounds like the book is running really well and I think you were a little bit more competitively priced this year than you were previously. So I guess first, is the expectation when we talk about mid-single digit to high single digit margins that you're within sort of that 5% to 7% range, do you expect to be towards the upper half of that, or maybe a bit above? And then second, how do you think about the market and the positioning for 2025? Do you think you're still going to maintain the current pricing position or do you expect to, I guess, be more competitive across your total footprint again?\nJoe Zubretsky: Our strategy in marketplace until we were satisfied that the risk pool was stabilized is to keep it as we say small, silver, and stable. But as the risk pool has stabilized, irrational pricing has pretty much left the market. We will allocate more capital to this business and we'll grow it at a rate that allows us to earn mid to high single-digit margins. That's the key for us. The risk pool can have inherent volatility and we believe that a margin target of 5% to 7% as you suggested is the right target margin and we will grow the business at a rate that allows us to achieve that target margin. We're very competitively positioned this year. We are in our silver product. We were number one and two in 30% of our counties this year as compared to 20% last year. 75% of the book is still silver. 50% of the book is renewal, which gives us good insight to capture appropriate risk scoring. The book is very well positioned to grow. 31% membership growth, 17% revenue growth just this year, and hopefully we'll be able to grow it at this rate in the future, all with the goal of achieving mid to high single-digit margins.\nCal Sternick: All right, great. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: All right, great. Thanks. Maybe two questions as I get in. I guess the first one on the Medicare side, I just want to make sure I understand your commentary around MLR because you're bringing in Bright with a PDR, but you're still saying you are going to be at the overall target margin. You're talking about the core business being at target margin, or even with Bright losing money you'll be at target margin on the consolidated book. And then thinking about the exchanges, I guess there was potentially some issue about redetermination to kick people off and then the sickest part of that population comes onto the exchanges. Are you seeing any of that or does the risk pool benefit of lower subsidies just kind of make that not really an issue? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Thanks, Kevin. I'm going to kick it to Mark for detailed commentary on the Medicare MLR, but I think it's really important to frame the Medicare business and its component parts. They're somewhat different and situationally, they are quite different. You have $6 billion of revenue forecasted for 2024 in Medicare. $1.6 billion is Bright newly acquired, subject to the premium deficiency reserve, as you suggested, and Mark will explain that in a minute. $2.4 billion is our legacy [indiscernible] business, and $2 billion are the MMP demonstrations, where rates are received from CMS. You're not [bidding] (ph) against the benchmark. So the dynamics in the book of business are quite different. You need to look at the three components in order to develop your view of the various profitability components. But with that as the backdrop and the context, I'll kick it to Mark for detailed commentary and how you build the Medicare MLR, particularly with respect to Bright and the premium deficiency reserves. Mark?\nMark Keim: Yeah, fantastic. Good morning, Kevin. So Bright comes to us with a PDR in place. With that PDR, the benefit goes into the MLR line and effectively reduces the MLR. So on the bright component, which is a third of our book, you'll see an MLR that's below our target range at the moment. On the DSNP, which is another third of our business, we're seeing a trend of probably around 4%. But overall, we're able to offset that and pull that into our target range. And of course, on MMP, which is the third component of the book, the rates that we're getting from our state and CMS partners, we feel are quite adequate to bring us all told to that ADA in our MLR guidance.\nJoe Zubretsky: With respect to your second question, if I remember correctly, it had to do with the exchanges and members coming off of the Medicaid roles into the exchanges. If you look at the last couple of years, membership has already always started the year at a higher point and ended the year at a lower point due to the natural attrition in the book. This year, we're starting the year at 320,000 members and plan to grow it to 370,000 by the end of the year. The natural attrition rate is still 2% or 3% inside that number, but we do plan to pick up more members from not only our own Medicaid plans, but competitors' Medicaid plans. I think we're seeing a penetration rate of people coming off Medicaid of about 10% of members lost. Mark, anything to add?\nMark Keim: Yeah, in the past, when we picked up SEP members, they put a little pressure on our MLR. What we're seeing in the third and fourth quarter in \u201823, and what I expect into \u201824 is they'll come over at more sustaining and normalized levels. That is, they won't put pressure on, because they're coming off normal using services. There's not pent-up demand. They're not new to the product. So I'm expecting to see a good pickup on SEP, as we did in Q3 and Q4, and not pressure on the MLR.\nOperator: The next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Two for me as well. The health insurance exchange membership up 31%, but revenues up 17%. Is that state geography mix-related or is that reductions in prices and what's driving that versus a market that's generally raising prices? And then I'm still confused on Bright, how the target -- how the MLR for Bright that you're booking this year is below the target range, but you're actually increasing the embedded earnings by $0.50 to $1.50? Maybe just help us understand those two parts.\nMark Keim: So a couple of things, and good morning, Josh. Our metallic mix has remained unchanged. So what you're seeing in Marketplace is not at all metallic or mix related. That's state footprint related. As you know, we're in 14 states, and our mix among the states, as we're more competitive in some, maybe not so much in others, our mix does shift a little bit. So that'd be the driver there. On Bright, on the PDR, with the PDR that was booked before we bought the business, that benefits the MLR and pulls it down to a level that's actually a little bit below our target range. Now remember, our target range is largely DSNP and MMP because that's our legacy Medicare book. On the bright with the PDR in the MLR line, it does pull it down a little bit below our target range.\nJosh Raskin: So how does that impact -- I'm just trying to -- so it feels like with the PDR, you guys will sort of reverse that through the year. How does the embedded earnings go up? Right. I'm confused with how is Bright, MLR low, but they're losing more money?\nMark Keim: It's a good question and thanks for raising that. I knew we were going to get that sooner or later. So with the PDR, as you know, the PDR should largely normalize expected operating losses on a contract year. PDR accounting doesn't allow you to put all of the losses into the PDR. There are certain accounting matters that are still held out. So even with the PDR, I'll have a very small operating loss, Josh. But the other thing is when we talk about embedded earnings, we always include the carrying costs. The embedded earnings are essentially fully capitalized or fully funded for their carrying costs. So when I say I have about $0.50 of dilution this year, it's about half operating costs that aren't covered by the PDR and about half carrying costs. Remember we paid about a half billion. The opportunity cost or interest on that is maybe the other half of the $0.50. So as a result, I'm carrying a $0.50 hole in this year's EPS bridge. Since that's a $0.50 hole, I said I'd have $1 of ultimate benefit from this property. The dollar now goes to $1.50 because I'm going to crawl out of that hole over the next couple of years.\nJosh Raskin: Okay. Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. I just want to follow up on Bright. So a few things here. First, can you give me the PDR number that you put through there for 2024?\nMark Keim: Sure, we acquired the business with a $75 million PDR on the balance sheet.\nJustin Lake: Okay, and so you're saying the -- I understand the PDR getting it to normal levels potentially, but how does the PDR get it below normal MLR levels?\nMark Keim: The PDR books all of the losses. It picks up a little bit of the G&A losses, with the medical cost losses, and books them into the medical cost line. So to the extent that there were some G&A items, it'll get picked up in the MLR line. It's just an accounting convention where the net of losses get picked up in one line item or the other.\nJustin Lake: Okay, so your point is that just thinking about the math of this, the MLR is going to go up next year because it's actually below normal and you're saying the SG&A will come down.\nMark Keim: There will be a little bit of that, Justin.\nJustin Lake: Okay. And you expect to get this full dollar back plus in 2025?\nJoe Zubretsky: And that's the important point. The important point here, first of all, the first year losses were fully contemplated in the value we paid. So there was no surprise there. The business is running at a 92% MCR and a 14% G&A ratio. We plan to get the 92% down to 88% to 89% and the 14% down to 9% to 10%. So half to two thirds of the turn is G&A related and we have very, very clear line of sight to how to take their cost burden down from 14% to 9% or 10% where it should be. That dollar of accretion is expected to emerge in the third full year of ownership. First year protected by -- mostly protected by a PDR. Second year, breakeven to probably slightly profitable. Full dollar of accretion in the third full year of ownership. Getting the MCR from 92% down to 88% or 89%, getting the 14% G&A ratio down to 9% or 10%.\nJustin Lake: Got it. And then lastly, just on, there's a big RP as you know in Florida, I think a lot of anticipation there around when that might be communicated. My understanding is we're kind of into the second round in negotiations. I assume you can't tell us whether you're still kind of in the running there, but any idea given that given where you are today, any idea when you think that under normal conditions that MLR would be announced? Or should the RFP would be announced, not the MLR?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, sure. And we appreciate your sensitivity to the situation. Yeah, we observe the sanctity of all these bidding processes, including the ITN process, so we can't comment specifically on it. But look, as we -- yet we run a nice business in Florida. It's smaller than it used to be to regions. We used to be statewide back in 2017. It runs really well. We're the only four-star plant in Florida. And the same team that works on all our successful bids, our $12 billion of re-procured revenue and our $7 billion of new contract wins, that is the same team that worked on this. So we go into it with a great deal of confidence and we would hope to expand our footprint in Florida. There's $14 billion of Medicaid revenue in Florida regions where we are not currently represented. But let's see how the process plays out and hopefully something will be announced, awards will be announced sometime later this spring.\nJustin Lake: Thanks for the color.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: Hi, thanks. I appreciate all the commentary on your Medicaid expectations for the year. I was hoping you could help us think about the bridge from your Medicaid MLR exit in the year to your same-store Medicaid MLR in 2024, around the midpoint of the range. I'm curious if you think that the [core] (ph) could kind of get there earlier in the year because some of the one-one rate adjustments that we've been focused on, or do you think that'll take some time to work through the business and then other seasonal factors play out? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: As a general framework for how we stay within our long-term range year-over-year, in fact, on the same story basis, almost equivalent, we talk about the redetermination process, which late in 2023 began to put pressure on the MLR until rates caught up with it. As Mark commented in his prepared remarks, we know about Medicaid rates on 80% of our revenue for 2024. That rate increase came in at 4%. So that blends to about 3.2%. We forecasted the other 20% at less than half that. So we have a 3.5% rate increase built into our 2024 guidance. And that was exactly commensurate with trend, trend even as influenced by the modest acuity shift that we and our state customers have observed. So pretty much business as usual. There's nothing, no medical cost category that needed to be accounted for or accommodated. It's actuarially sound rates impacted by acuity adjustments that 20 of 21 of our states included. And it was completely in line with our contemplated medical cost trend, even as influenced by an acuity shift. Mark, anything to add?\nMark Keim: No, I think that's exactly right. As we look at the rates and the trend being roughly equal, our legacy book pretty much holds flat. As you know, we're bringing in a bunch of additional new business that puts a little more pressure in the first year, which rounds us out at the 89% that we have in guidance.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Hi, good morning and thanks for the questions. I wanted to ask on the Marketplace MCR, I guess moving back to the low end of the long-term range. So up about 300 basis points year-over-year. Can you just talk about what's driving that increase year-over-year? Is that just a function of the membership growth that you saw? And then have you thought of -- how, I guess, are you thinking about maybe the long-term target for that business? Is 78% to 80% still the right range to use? And then just one clarifying question for Mark. I think you said quarterly EPS is weighted towards the back half of the year. I think usually the back half is about 45% of the total year. So does that mean this year will be over 50% or is that not the right way to interpret the comment that you made? Thank you.\nJoe Zubretsky: David, I'll take the Marketplace question first. We were running really well in the middle of the 2023. Our experience was quite positive. So we consciously, consciously bid to grow the business modestly and moderately, as we suggested we would. And so we priced somewhat below the observed trend, not usually below the observed trend, but slightly below the observed trend, to essentially invest some of the excess margin. We earned nearly 10% pre-tax in that business in 2023. So in a sense, we invested some of the excess margin in growth, hence the 31% membership growth and 17% revenue growth. Mark, on the phasing -- quarterly phasing?\nMark Keim: Yeah, absolutely. Nathan, and good morning. Yeah, you got it right. We're normally 55-45 on the front half versus the second half of the year. I'd almost flip that around this year because the dynamics are a little bit different. One, we put on a lot of new business this year. As you can see in our revenue bridge, we got $5.7 billion of new revenue coming into the company, which always comes in just a little bit warmer in the first year, but in the first quarters in particular. So I'm expecting to get some momentum on MLRs in Medicaid and Medicare as we kind of grow into our new footprint there. So that'll change the dynamic a little bit. The other thing is, and I think Joe touched on this, very often, Marketplace has attrition throughout the year such that Marketplace declines during the year. This year is a little bit different. With all the members rolling off on redet and us expecting to pick up our fair share of them in Marketplace as they convert, we'll see a growing book in Marketplace. And as you know, we've got some confidence on the margins given that we really prioritize margin over volume in Marketplace. So for those two reasons, you're going to see a little bit more of a back-end loaded EPS trajectory this year. I think that should address your question.\nNathan Rich: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\nSarah James: Thank you. Can you clarify for us what you guys contemplated in for two midnights and V28 into your 2024 plan design and also for Bright? And when you mentioned the pressures that you were seeing on Medicare, you guys didn't flag outpatient or some of the inpatient trends that the rest of the group is seeing. So I wanted to clarify if you are seeing this?\nJoe Zubretsky: Hi, Sarah. I'll kick it to Mark for we have very detailed analysis of the changes in the risk adjustment rules and what it meant for our book. In answer to your second question, one of the reasons I articulated earlier the configuration of our book of business being somewhat different than what I call mainstream Medicare Advantage is that we have a low income, high acuity population. Our members are using services from the first day of the year to the last day of the year. They're chronic. They have comorbidities and are polychronic. And so the notion of discretionary utilization means far less to our business based on its mix than it might be to a mainstream population where discretionary or the pedic procedures are being done, screenings are taking place, perhaps, and up demand from the pandemic. In our book of highly chronic patients, high acuity members, that's less of a dynamic. And so the three cost categories that I articulated previously, LTSS hours, high cost drugs, GLP-1s, and the supplemental benefits were really the drivers in our book. Mark, do you want to take the risk adjustment question?\nMark Keim: Sure. And I think, Sarah, it's important, as Joe mentioned, when we talk about Medicare, it's in fact three things. Your probably question is most aimed at the DSNP, or high acuity component of our Medicare, which is a third of the book. Obviously, it's less relevant to MMP. On the two things you mentioned, on the two midnight rule, I've seen a little bit of buzz about that lately, and we're a little bit surprised because it's certainly not new. And many of us have factored this in for quite some time. And what I always remind folks is even though there's a two midnight rule, providers still have to prove medical necessity, so there's really not a big window there for a change in trend or a change in risk adjustment issues as we can see it. On V28, it's got some interesting dynamics. It is certainly a drag in many places for folks, but there's an interesting dynamic around V28 and high acuity. On single-chronic, people use the example of diabetes, where there's diabetes, but there's some other conditions that kind of correlate or are highly associated with diabetes. V28 will be a reduction on risk adjustment for those kind of situations. But when there's polychronics where there's different comorbidities that are in fact quite different than each other, V28 is actually helpful. And in our high acuity chronic book, we actually have many of those polychronics. So we don't quite see the same dynamic that maybe some of the other folks do out there.\nSarah James: That's helpful. And one more clarification if I could, just on your comment with the exchanges, I know you guys are guiding to a really favorable MLR for this year, but is there still a step-up in earnings as you mature this new book? I guess in other words, your year one is still slightly below target range, right, on new members? And then there would be an implied earnings lift as that book moves into the second year of operations?\nJoe Zubretsky: I'm not quite sure I've captured the essence of your question, but we are forecasting a 78% MCR for the year, which is at the low end of our long-term target range, which means we'll be operating high single-digit margins, certainly not the 10% pre-tax we achieved in 2023. But look, if you grow the book more aggressively, more of your members are going to be new to the book. And so you have to -- in our view, you have to strike a balance about how fast you're going to grow it and how many new members you want. Every new member that comes in, you need to find risk adjustment. If they come in during SEP, if they're chronic, you better find risk adjustment quickly or they won't get the profitability in the near term. So there's a -- very much a balance between what you get in annual enrollment, what you pick up in SEP, and how one thinks about how fast do I grow the book to achieve mid-single-digit margins when the maturity of the membership and the duration of the membership is pretty important to the stability of the risk pool. You have to balance those two factors.\nSarah James: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Yeah, good morning guys. And I think Nate and Sarah kind of covered everything I wanted to hit on the exchange, but I'll try to bring up one more topic, which is I guess, can you talk about underlying utilization trends and kind of cost growth trends there because it sounds like you guys priced the book for growth in 2024 but the utilization is going to kind of continue to remain low. So I guess I'm trying to parse the spread between utilization trends and price growth for the margin expansion. Kind of any color on that would be helpful?\nMark Keim: And, George, your question is focused on Marketplace?\nGeorge Hill: Yeah, Marketplace.\nMark Keim: Yeah, look, as Joe has been very clear, we're prioritizing margin over volume in this business, and the way we do that is we keep it silver, which we believe is the best product for both the member and the payor. But we keep it stable, which means we continue to have really good renewals. As we look at our pricing objectives here, we're putting price into the market to make sure that we can defend reasonable margins here. We did concede a little bit of margin in our pricing for 2024 just because we were well below our target range. Remember our target range is 78% to 80% and we printed something a little bit south of that in \u201823. So there's no reason to leave volume on the table if we can put a little bit of price back, drive some volume and still hit our margin targets. Hope that helps.\nGeorge Hill: It does. And maybe if I can just sneak in a quick follow-up. I know it's a tiny piece of the business. Could you talk about kind of the expected disruption in PDP in 2025 given the changes from IRA?\nJoe Zubretsky: I'm sorry, we had trouble hearing the last part of your question, George. PDP?\nGeorge Hill: Yeah, but like I said, I know it's a tiny part of the business, but we're expecting kind of PDP to be pretty disruptive or disrupted in 2025 because of the IRA changes. I know it's a tiny part of the book, but if you guys have any commentary on what you're saying would be helpful.\nMark Keim: Yeah. So on PDP, as you know, we don't price a PDP product and the IRA or the Inflation Reduction Act, as you're pointing out, is certainly a headwind for that sector, but that's not too relevant to our business, George.\nGeorge Hill: Thank you.\nOperator: The last question today will come from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Thanks. Right before the bell here. I just was interested if you could walk us through your preliminary analysis on the 2025 MA advance notice and whether you're able to parse that down between the legacy business impact and then what you're projecting will be the preliminary impact on the Bright book? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, Scott. I mean, on balance, our view is the same view that you've heard from others, is that the advance notice does not appear to be adequate to compensate for trends that we're all observing. I think in our book, if you take the CMS advance notice and project it to our book, I think we're projecting about a 50 basis point, 0.5 point of rate increase, which we believe is, along with others, is insufficient, and we'll see where the final notice comes out. It usually comes out, as you know, better than that. But our view is not any different from anybody else's.\nMark Keim: Yeah, just to build on that, and a lot of this data is in the public domain at this point. On the effective benchmark rates in the advance notice and then risk or normalization, most folks are seeing across the entire market, the net of those at about zero, right? As Joe mentioned, we see a net of about a positive 50 bps. So we're a little bit better on the benchmark rate, and we're a little bit not so bad on the risk score normalization for some reasons I alluded to earlier. So we're seeing about a 50 BP benefit there, and obviously the rest of STARS impact and what ultimately everyone does with risk scores has yet to play out. But that's our initial point on the legacy book.\nScott Fidel: Thanks. And then just to clarify, so the 50 bps, that's for the overall book, right? And then I would assume that, [directionally] (ph) the legacy book probably better in the Bright book, a little worse than the legacy in that? Is that a fair assumption?\nMark Keim: We're still working our way through that. There will be a couple things going on there. As I mentioned earlier, we're six weeks into owning it. We're working through those issues with the team there. There will also be a bunch of dynamics that happen this year. There are actually two entities there. One is Community Health Plan, and the other one, Brand New Day. There will be some issues between them on exactly how we balance the effects of all this between those two entities. So a little bit of work there and not ready to comment on that one.\nJoe Zubretsky: But I would say that we're not anticipating in any analysis when completed on rates that would move us off of achieving the $1 accretion in the third full year of ownership. We're pretty confident in that trajectory.\nScott Fidel: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session and also concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Keim",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss some additional details on our fourth quarter and full year performance, the balance sheet redeterminations and our 2024 guidance. Beginning with our fourth quarter and full year results. For the quarter, we reported $9 billion in total revenue and $8.4 billion of premium revenue. I will note that total revenue includes approximately $380 million in reimbursement for our California MCO tax item that was retrospective to April. This item modestly distorts our reported G&A and margin ratios, but has no net economic consequence. On a consolidated basis, our fourth quarter MCR was 89.1% and our full year was 88.1%, reflecting continued strong medical cost management. Our full year consolidated MCR was consistent with our expectations and squarely in line with our long-term target range. In Medicaid, our fourth quarter reported MCR was 89.2%. The MCR included a moderate impact from the net effect of redetermination acuity shifts and corridors in several states, as well as some MCR pressure from the additions of our Iowa health plan and our My Choice acquisition. Across our Medicaid segment, the major medical cost categories were largely in line with our expectations and normal quarter-to-quarter trend fluctuations. Our full year Medicaid MCR was 88.7%, within our long-term target range and consistent with our expectations. In Medicare, our fourth quarter reported MCR was 93.3% and our full year was 90.7%, both above our long-term target range and impacted by increased utilization of supplemental benefits, in-home services and high-cost drugs. As Joe mentioned, we are confident that our 2024 bid strategy adjustments to benefit design as well as operational improvements will produce target margins in our Medicare business in 2024. In Marketplace, our reported fourth quarter MCR was 79.8%, reflecting our continued success in returning this business to target margins. Our full year Marketplace MCR of 75.3% was well below our long-term target range. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7% as reported. However, when accounting for the California pass-through premium tax item, the ratio restates to 7.3%. This result includes new business implementation spending for new contract wins in California, Nebraska and New Mexico as well as expected seasonal expenditures from Medicare and Marketplace marketing. Our full year adjusted G&A ratio was 7.2%. Recognizing the California tax item in the fourth quarter, the full year G&A ratio restated to 7.3%. Turning to our Bright acquisition. We successfully closed the transaction effective this past January 1, at final price of $425 million net of tax benefits which was lower than our initially announced terms. The acquisition adds 109,000 members and contributes $1.6 billion in premium this year. We acquired the business with a premium deficiency reserve, which is expected to moderate first year losses, but we still expect the acquisition to be approximately $0.50 dilutive to 2024 adjusted EPS. Now that we have owned the business for six weeks, we have increased confidence in our assumption that the Bright acquisition will deliver an ultimate accretion of $1 per share as final run rate margin. Given the expectation of this modest lot in the first year, we are updating the 2024 new store embedded earnings from the Bright acquisition to $1.50 per share, reflecting this $0.50 of first year dilution. Moving on to Medicaid redeterminations. In the quarter, we estimate we lost 200,000 members driven by redeterminations, bringing the full year figure to approximately 500,000. We are now updating our estimate of members gained during the pandemic to 1 million to include new business additions in 2023 and 2024 as well as the legacy business. Given the high rate of procedural disenrollments rather than through verification, we are seeing a nearly 30% reconnect rate, consistent with previous quarters. As reconnects continue, we expect the membership losses just described to restate to a lower level over the coming months. We continue to project ultimately retaining 40% of our updated members gained, which implies a net loss of 600,000 from the redetermination process. The offsetting positive impact from our growth initiatives is significant. We ended 2022 with 4.8 million Medicaid members, and we expect to close out 2024 with 5.1 million members, a net 300,000 member growth over a two-year period, despite the losses from redetermination. Moving to Medicaid rates. We now have visibility into rates impacting approximately 80% of our 2024 premium. All but one of our states have now included an acuity adjustment for redetermination for 2024. We continue to work with our state partners to ensure appropriate rates through the normal rate cycle, retroactive or mid-cycle adjustments given the experience to date. We are confident that the requirement for actuarially sound rates will offset trends as they may emerge. Updated rates and trend assumptions have been considered in the 2024 Medicaid MCR that supports our guidance. Turning to our balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. We harvested approximately $280 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, and our parent company cash balance was approximately $740 million, a portion of which was used to fund the Bright Medicare acquisition just after the first of the year. Debt at the end of the quarter was 1.4 times trailing 12-month EBITDA with our debt-to-cap ratio at 36.3%. These ratios reflect our low leverage position and ample cash and capital capacity for additional growth and investment. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, we are confident in the strength of our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 50. Now some additional details on our 2024 guidance, beginning with membership. In Medicaid, we expect new membership from our recent new contract wins to add approximately 650,000 members. We expect to lose 100,000 members over the remainder of the redetermination process in 2024. The net result in 2024 year-end membership of approximately 5.1 million members or 12% growth year-over-year. In Medicare, the Bright acquisition added 109,000 members. Combined with our legacy business, we expect to end 2024 with 270,000 Medicare members, representing 58% growth year-over-year. In Marketplace, based on open enrollment, we expect to begin 2024 with approximately 320,000 members, representing 14% growth from year-end 2023. We expect growth to continue through the year, boosted by the redetermination conversions and ending with approximately 370,000 members, representing 31% growth year-over-year. We are still 75% silver, which bodes well for medical margin stability. Our 2024 premium revenue guidance is approximately $38 billion, representing 17% growth from 2023. Our revenue growth is comprised of several items, $3.3 billion of revenue tied to our recent RFP wins. To this, we add $2.4 billion of revenue from our recently closed acquisitions, including $1.6 billion from Bright and $800 million from a full year of My Choice Wisconsin. And finally, $1.7 billion of organic growth across Medicaid, Medicare and Marketplace. Partially offsetting these growth drivers is a higher estimated full year impact of $1.9 billion in decreased revenue from redeterminations. Moving on to earnings guidance. We expect 2024 full year adjusted earnings of at least $23.50 per share. Our EPS guidance reflects the realization of approximately $2 per share of 2023 new store embedded earnings, approximately $2 for the underlying organic growth across our current Medicaid and Medicare footprints, the realization of $0.75 benefit from the onetime nonrecurring implementation costs incurred in 2023, partially offset by $1.25 impact from redeterminations and $0.50 impact from the Bright acquisitions first year operating and carrying costs and finally, $0.25 from a conservative view of earnings contribution from investment income. Turning to MCR guidance. Our consolidated Medical Care Ratio is expected to be 88.2%. Our Medicaid MCR is expected to be 89%, at the high end of our long-term target range. This guidance reflects the inclusion of our significant new store growth, which runs at a higher MCR in the first year. Our legacy or same-store Medicaid MCR is expected to fall in the middle of our long-term range. We anticipate our Medicare MCR to be 88%, while at the high end of our long-term target range, the MCR reflects our expected success in our 2024 bid strategy adjustments to benefit design and various operational improvements. For Marketplace, we expect the MCR at the low end of the long-term target MCR range of 78% to 80%. Moving on to select P&L guidance metrics. We expect our adjusted G&A ratio to fall to 7% as new business implementation costs subside, and we leverage the increased scale of our business. Effective tax rate of 25.7%. Adjusted pretax margin of 4.6%, well within our long-term target range. Weighted average share count unchanged at 58.1 million shares. And our quarterly EPS will be weighted slightly heavier towards the second half of the year as we drive improved performance in our new business portfolio additions over the course of the year. Turning to embedded earnings. We ended 2023 with $5.50 per share of new store embedded earnings. Our 2024 guidance includes the realization of $2, resulting in a new base of $3.50. To this, we add $0.50 for the impact of Bright acquisitions first year loss, leaving us with $4 remaining at the end of 2024. We expect the majority of this to emerge in 2025 giving us further confidence in our 15% to 18% long-term growth rate for EPS. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Joe summarized that well. Look, we finished 88.7% in 2023 for Medicaid. And as Joe mentioned, that included a little bit of pressure from the acuity shift from redet, but also as we projected the benefit of some corridors. So really tracking exactly where we expect it. Here in the new year on our legacy book, trend roughly equals the rates that we're getting from our state partners. So on our legacy book into \u201824, we're roughly seeing about a flat MLR versus where we finished 2023. Now, why are we at an 89% in guidance? Just as Joe mentioned, we're adding significant new store business through both our acquisitions and a number of big wins. Whenever we have new store go into our portfolio, it tends to be a little bit hotter in the first year on an MLR. So we're seeing a pretty much flat carryover on legacy, a little bit of increased pressure on new store. That's how you get to that 89% that we have in our guidance. Yeah, fantastic. Good morning, Kevin. So Bright comes to us with a PDR in place. With that PDR, the benefit goes into the MLR line and effectively reduces the MLR. So on the bright component, which is a third of our book, you'll see an MLR that's below our target range at the moment. On the DSNP, which is another third of our business, we're seeing a trend of probably around 4%. But overall, we're able to offset that and pull that into our target range. And of course, on MMP, which is the third component of the book, the rates that we're getting from our state and CMS partners, we feel are quite adequate to bring us all told to that ADA in our MLR guidance. Yeah, in the past, when we picked up SEP members, they put a little pressure on our MLR. What we're seeing in the third and fourth quarter in \u201823, and what I expect into \u201824 is they'll come over at more sustaining and normalized levels. That is, they won't put pressure on, because they're coming off normal using services. There's not pent-up demand. They're not new to the product. So I'm expecting to see a good pickup on SEP, as we did in Q3 and Q4, and not pressure on the MLR. So a couple of things, and good morning, Josh. Our metallic mix has remained unchanged. So what you're seeing in Marketplace is not at all metallic or mix related. That's state footprint related. As you know, we're in 14 states, and our mix among the states, as we're more competitive in some, maybe not so much in others, our mix does shift a little bit. So that'd be the driver there. On Bright, on the PDR, with the PDR that was booked before we bought the business, that benefits the MLR and pulls it down to a level that's actually a little bit below our target range. Now remember, our target range is largely DSNP and MMP because that's our legacy Medicare book. On the bright with the PDR in the MLR line, it does pull it down a little bit below our target range. It's a good question and thanks for raising that. I knew we were going to get that sooner or later. So with the PDR, as you know, the PDR should largely normalize expected operating losses on a contract year. PDR accounting doesn't allow you to put all of the losses into the PDR. There are certain accounting matters that are still held out. So even with the PDR, I'll have a very small operating loss, Josh. But the other thing is when we talk about embedded earnings, we always include the carrying costs. The embedded earnings are essentially fully capitalized or fully funded for their carrying costs. So when I say I have about $0.50 of dilution this year, it's about half operating costs that aren't covered by the PDR and about half carrying costs. Remember we paid about a half billion. The opportunity cost or interest on that is maybe the other half of the $0.50. So as a result, I'm carrying a $0.50 hole in this year's EPS bridge. Since that's a $0.50 hole, I said I'd have $1 of ultimate benefit from this property. The dollar now goes to $1.50 because I'm going to crawl out of that hole over the next couple of years. Sure, we acquired the business with a $75 million PDR on the balance sheet. The PDR books all of the losses. It picks up a little bit of the G&A losses, with the medical cost losses, and books them into the medical cost line. So to the extent that there were some G&A items, it'll get picked up in the MLR line. It's just an accounting convention where the net of losses get picked up in one line item or the other. There will be a little bit of that, Justin. No, I think that's exactly right. As we look at the rates and the trend being roughly equal, our legacy book pretty much holds flat. As you know, we're bringing in a bunch of additional new business that puts a little more pressure in the first year, which rounds us out at the 89% that we have in guidance. Yeah, absolutely. Nathan, and good morning. Yeah, you got it right. We're normally 55-45 on the front half versus the second half of the year. I'd almost flip that around this year because the dynamics are a little bit different. One, we put on a lot of new business this year. As you can see in our revenue bridge, we got $5.7 billion of new revenue coming into the company, which always comes in just a little bit warmer in the first year, but in the first quarters in particular. So I'm expecting to get some momentum on MLRs in Medicaid and Medicare as we kind of grow into our new footprint there. So that'll change the dynamic a little bit. The other thing is, and I think Joe touched on this, very often, Marketplace has attrition throughout the year such that Marketplace declines during the year. This year is a little bit different. With all the members rolling off on redet and us expecting to pick up our fair share of them in Marketplace as they convert, we'll see a growing book in Marketplace. And as you know, we've got some confidence on the margins given that we really prioritize margin over volume in Marketplace. So for those two reasons, you're going to see a little bit more of a back-end loaded EPS trajectory this year. I think that should address your question. Sure. And I think, Sarah, it's important, as Joe mentioned, when we talk about Medicare, it's in fact three things. Your probably question is most aimed at the DSNP, or high acuity component of our Medicare, which is a third of the book. Obviously, it's less relevant to MMP. On the two things you mentioned, on the two midnight rule, I've seen a little bit of buzz about that lately, and we're a little bit surprised because it's certainly not new. And many of us have factored this in for quite some time. And what I always remind folks is even though there's a two midnight rule, providers still have to prove medical necessity, so there's really not a big window there for a change in trend or a change in risk adjustment issues as we can see it. On V28, it's got some interesting dynamics. It is certainly a drag in many places for folks, but there's an interesting dynamic around V28 and high acuity. On single-chronic, people use the example of diabetes, where there's diabetes, but there's some other conditions that kind of correlate or are highly associated with diabetes. V28 will be a reduction on risk adjustment for those kind of situations. But when there's polychronics where there's different comorbidities that are in fact quite different than each other, V28 is actually helpful. And in our high acuity chronic book, we actually have many of those polychronics. So we don't quite see the same dynamic that maybe some of the other folks do out there. And, George, your question is focused on Marketplace? Yeah, look, as Joe has been very clear, we're prioritizing margin over volume in this business, and the way we do that is we keep it silver, which we believe is the best product for both the member and the payor. But we keep it stable, which means we continue to have really good renewals. As we look at our pricing objectives here, we're putting price into the market to make sure that we can defend reasonable margins here. We did concede a little bit of margin in our pricing for 2024 just because we were well below our target range. Remember our target range is 78% to 80% and we printed something a little bit south of that in \u201823. So there's no reason to leave volume on the table if we can put a little bit of price back, drive some volume and still hit our margin targets. Hope that helps. Yeah. So on PDP, as you know, we don't price a PDP product and the IRA or the Inflation Reduction Act, as you're pointing out, is certainly a headwind for that sector, but that's not too relevant to our business, George. Yeah, just to build on that, and a lot of this data is in the public domain at this point. On the effective benchmark rates in the advance notice and then risk or normalization, most folks are seeing across the entire market, the net of those at about zero, right? As Joe mentioned, we see a net of about a positive 50 bps. So we're a little bit better on the benchmark rate, and we're a little bit not so bad on the risk score normalization for some reasons I alluded to earlier. So we're seeing about a 50 BP benefit there, and obviously the rest of STARS impact and what ultimately everyone does with risk scores has yet to play out. But that's our initial point on the legacy book. We're still working our way through that. There will be a couple things going on there. As I mentioned earlier, we're six weeks into owning it. We're working through those issues with the team there. There will also be a bunch of dynamics that happen this year. There are actually two entities there. One is Community Health Plan, and the other one, Brand New Day. There will be some issues between them on exactly how we balance the effects of all this between those two entities. So a little bit of work there and not ready to comment on that one."

            "name": "Joe Zubretsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Today, I will discuss several topics. Our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, our growth initiatives and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth, our 2024 premium revenue and earnings guidance and an affirmation of our long-term growth targets. Let me start with our fourth quarter performance. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.38 on $8.4 billion of premium revenue. Our fourth quarter results and performance metrics demonstrated strong medical cost management and operating cost discipline. Medicaid continued to perform well, withstanding the impacts of the unprecedented redetermination process. Medicare experienced higher than target medical costs, consistent with prior quarters and Marketplace performed very well despite the late in-year medical cost seasonality typically experienced. Our fourth quarter completes a strong year of operating and financial performance. Full year adjusted earnings per share of $20.88 represents 17% year-over-year growth, squarely in line with our long-term target range of 15% to 18% and 6% above our initial 2023 guidance of at least $19.75. Our full year premium revenue of $32.5 billion represents 5% year-over-year growth, and our pretax margin of 4.8% is at the high end of our long-term target range heading into 2024. In Medicaid, our flagship business representing over 80% of revenue, we reported an 88.7% MCR for the full year, which is within our long-term target range. Throughout the redetermination process, we have managed through a number of factors that shape Medicaid's performance, all to land the full year result at a solid jump-off point into 2024. These factors included medical cost utilization, various state corridors and MLR minimums and prospective rate changes. In Medicare, the full year MCR was 90.7%. While the business is profitable, we did not meet our performance expectations due to higher utilization of supplemental benefits, in-home services and high-cost drugs. I am confident that our 2024 bid strategy, adjustments to benefit design and various operational improvements will return the business to target margins in 2024. In Marketplace, we reported a 75.3% MCR for the full year, below the low end of our target range, which reflects the successful execution of our small, silver and stable strategy. This business is now positioned to grow at a rate, which allows us to sustain mid-single-digit margins. In addition to delivering strong financial results, in 2023, we continued to execute on our profitable growth strategy. To recap the growth milestones achieved in 2023. In January, we successfully reprocured our contract in Texas for the state's STAR+PLUS program, retaining all eight regions and likely growing market share. In July, we successfully launched our Iowa Medicaid plan following the RFP, which we had won in a highly competitive process in late 2022. In August, we announced that we were awarded a contract to once again serve Medicaid beneficiaries in the state of New Mexico. In September, we closed on the My Choice Wisconsin acquisition, further expanding our market-leading LTSS franchise. In June, we agreed to acquire Bright Health's California Medicare business, which we have now closed effective January 1, 2024. Also effective January 1 and after another win in a highly competitive bid process, we successfully launched our Nebraska health plan. And finally, on January 1, we launched our expanded California platform, including Los Angeles County, which doubled the size of our business in the state. Collectively, these acquisitions and RFP successes represent $7 billion of annual premium revenue, a portion of which was in our 2023 results, most of which is in our 2024 guidance and all of which will be fully realized in 2025. To say we are pleased with the execution of our 2023 growth initiatives would be an understatement. But the growth story doesn't stop there. The pipeline of opportunities, fueling our future growth trajectory is extremely strong. Let me begin with reprocurements. We have submitted our RFP responses for contract renewals in Florida, Virginia and Michigan. We are proven partners with all three of these states, and we are confident in our ability to retain and grow these relationships. With regard to new state opportunities, including the Florida opportunity just described, there is over $50 billion of total premium revenue opportunity, active or near term, up for bid in several states over the coming years. We have already submitted bids in the states of Kansas and Georgia. With our demonstrated capabilities and referenceable track record, we remain confident in our ability to continue to win new state contracts. With respect to our M&A initiatives, our acquisition pipeline remains robust with actionable opportunities and we are confident in our ability to deliver growth from this key component of our strategy. Since 2019, we have completed eight transactions having acquired over $11 billion of premium for which we paid 22% of revenue. This capital allocation to M&A will continue to be a value driver. Turning now to our 2024 guidance. We project 2024 premium revenue of approximately $38 billion, which is consistent with our previous outlook and represents 17% year-over-year growth. We project 2024 adjusted earnings per share of at least $23.50, representing 13% year-over-year growth. Mark will take you through the detailed guidance build in a few minutes. But in the meantime, let me offer some high-level commentary. Our projected premium revenue growth to $38 billion represents a well-balanced combination of new contract wins, acquisitions and growth in our current footprint, partially offset by the impact of Medicaid redeterminations. With respect to earnings guidance in the core business, in Medicaid, our guidance fully considers the impact of the redetermination process. From a margin perspective, this is playing out as we have predicted. The impact of acuity shifts is real, but not significant. The risk corridors acted as a financial buffer and rates prospective and retrospective are largely capturing the trend impact. On a same-store basis, we are projecting the 2024 Medicaid MCR to be within our long-term range. We expect Medicare to return to mid-single-digit profitability in 2024 as a result of our bid strategy, adjustments to benefit design and operational improvements in the legacy business. Our Marketplace product has been priced right, is competitively positioned and the risk pool has stabilized. We expect the business to achieve mid to high single-digit margins, membership to grow over 30% and revenue to grow 17%. On top of our 2024 earnings per share guidance of at least $23.50, we now have $4 per share of new store embedded earnings, which, as you may recall, represents the expected accretion produced by our new store growth. Mark will review the components of the updated $4 per share in his remarks. Our confidence in our 2024 guidance starts with a high-quality 2023 earnings baseline and then takes a thorough account of all the various factors, exogenous and company-specific, that could impact earnings in 2024. Now, a few comments on our longer-term trajectory. Our 2024 guidance picture is one more data point that validates our long-term targets of 13% to 15% premium growth and 15% to 18% adjusted earnings per share growth. We committed to these targets at our Investor Day last May, and we reaffirm that commitment today. With the majority of the $4 of new store embedded earnings expected to emerge in 2025, we already see a clear outlook to achieving the low end of our long-term EPS growth target in 2025, even before considering the execution of additional growth initiatives and driving growth from our current footprint. In summary, we are very pleased with our 2023 performance, our trajectory to deliver the growth and profitability inherent in our 2024 guidance and the embedded earnings outlook we provided for 2025. Our confidence in continuing to achieve our long-term targets is data-driven as demonstrated by the following historical fact set. We have reprocured approximately $12 billion in existing revenue. We have added approximately $7 billion of new revenue through wins of new or expanded contracts in seven states. From 2020 to 2023, we achieved 21% annual premium growth and 25% annual earnings per share growth. 2024 guidance, 17% premium revenue growth year-over-year, 13% earnings per share growth year-over-year. And for 2025, and we expect to harvest the majority of our $4 per share of embedded earnings. Our strategy is clear and simple. We are in the business of providing access to high-quality health care for individuals relying on government assistance. Our business model is also clear and simple. We take on capitated risk, take or make rates that are commensurate with medical cost trends, and manage those trends to consistently achieve our target margins while maintaining higher standards of quality. The execution of our strategy and business model has been and will continue to be strong which is why we look to the future with a great deal of confidence. In conclusion, I want to extend my special thanks to our 19,000 associates who are dedicated to delivering access to high-quality healthcare to our members. It is my privilege to serve with such a committed and capable group of professionals. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark? Sure, A.J. With respect to the Medicare MLR question, we have three components of medical costs that ran higher than expectations. One was LTSS hours on the Medicaid side of the MMP business. Second, high-cost drugs. And third, supplemental benefits, vision, dental, cash card, over the counter was a little too richly designed in 2023 to be honest. We pulled back on those benefits in our 2024 product design and bids. We reshaped some of the allowance-based benefits to be more managed, and we're confident that that cost category will come back into line. On LTSS hours on the Medicaid side of the MMP benefit, we know where, we know why, and those corrective actions are in place. And it's not unusual in a soft economy for in-home service hours to increase. So we are very confident in the restoration of our MCRs back to the top end of the range in Medicare to 88% in 2024. You also asked about the Medicaid MLR. And let me frame it this way, and then I'll turn it to Mark. The re-determination process actually unfolded exactly as we had planned and as we had predicted. The acuity shift was noticeable, but it was -- it wasn't dramatic and it wasn't significant, but it was noticeable. And that began to happen as the redetermination process began. We then said, and it occurred, that the first financial cushion would be the corridors, the payments into the corridors that existed in the latter half of 2023. That acted as a financial buffer. In the meantime, as the acuity shift became noticeable to our state partners, they began to introduce rate adjustments to account for the acuity shift. So going into 2024, the rate actions completely compensated for what we call [poor] (ph) medical trend, completely compensated for any acuity shift, and that's why we're able to print an MCR in Medicaid at the high end of the range at 89%, which includes a little bit of pressure from the new business that we put on the books. Our strategy in marketplace until we were satisfied that the risk pool was stabilized is to keep it as we say small, silver, and stable. But as the risk pool has stabilized, irrational pricing has pretty much left the market. We will allocate more capital to this business and we'll grow it at a rate that allows us to earn mid to high single-digit margins. That's the key for us. The risk pool can have inherent volatility and we believe that a margin target of 5% to 7% as you suggested is the right target margin and we will grow the business at a rate that allows us to achieve that target margin. We're very competitively positioned this year. We are in our silver product. We were number one and two in 30% of our counties this year as compared to 20% last year. 75% of the book is still silver. 50% of the book is renewal, which gives us good insight to capture appropriate risk scoring. The book is very well positioned to grow. 31% membership growth, 17% revenue growth just this year, and hopefully we'll be able to grow it at this rate in the future, all with the goal of achieving mid to high single-digit margins. Thanks, Kevin. I'm going to kick it to Mark for detailed commentary on the Medicare MLR, but I think it's really important to frame the Medicare business and its component parts. They're somewhat different and situationally, they are quite different. You have $6 billion of revenue forecasted for 2024 in Medicare. $1.6 billion is Bright newly acquired, subject to the premium deficiency reserve, as you suggested, and Mark will explain that in a minute. $2.4 billion is our legacy [indiscernible] business, and $2 billion are the MMP demonstrations, where rates are received from CMS. You're not [bidding] (ph) against the benchmark. So the dynamics in the book of business are quite different. You need to look at the three components in order to develop your view of the various profitability components. But with that as the backdrop and the context, I'll kick it to Mark for detailed commentary and how you build the Medicare MLR, particularly with respect to Bright and the premium deficiency reserves. Mark? With respect to your second question, if I remember correctly, it had to do with the exchanges and members coming off of the Medicaid roles into the exchanges. If you look at the last couple of years, membership has already always started the year at a higher point and ended the year at a lower point due to the natural attrition in the book. This year, we're starting the year at 320,000 members and plan to grow it to 370,000 by the end of the year. The natural attrition rate is still 2% or 3% inside that number, but we do plan to pick up more members from not only our own Medicaid plans, but competitors' Medicaid plans. I think we're seeing a penetration rate of people coming off Medicaid of about 10% of members lost. Mark, anything to add? And that's the important point. The important point here, first of all, the first year losses were fully contemplated in the value we paid. So there was no surprise there. The business is running at a 92% MCR and a 14% G&A ratio. We plan to get the 92% down to 88% to 89% and the 14% down to 9% to 10%. So half to two thirds of the turn is G&A related and we have very, very clear line of sight to how to take their cost burden down from 14% to 9% or 10% where it should be. That dollar of accretion is expected to emerge in the third full year of ownership. First year protected by -- mostly protected by a PDR. Second year, breakeven to probably slightly profitable. Full dollar of accretion in the third full year of ownership. Getting the MCR from 92% down to 88% or 89%, getting the 14% G&A ratio down to 9% or 10%. Sure, sure. And we appreciate your sensitivity to the situation. Yeah, we observe the sanctity of all these bidding processes, including the ITN process, so we can't comment specifically on it. But look, as we -- yet we run a nice business in Florida. It's smaller than it used to be to regions. We used to be statewide back in 2017. It runs really well. We're the only four-star plant in Florida. And the same team that works on all our successful bids, our $12 billion of re-procured revenue and our $7 billion of new contract wins, that is the same team that worked on this. So we go into it with a great deal of confidence and we would hope to expand our footprint in Florida. There's $14 billion of Medicaid revenue in Florida regions where we are not currently represented. But let's see how the process plays out and hopefully something will be announced, awards will be announced sometime later this spring. As a general framework for how we stay within our long-term range year-over-year, in fact, on the same story basis, almost equivalent, we talk about the redetermination process, which late in 2023 began to put pressure on the MLR until rates caught up with it. As Mark commented in his prepared remarks, we know about Medicaid rates on 80% of our revenue for 2024. That rate increase came in at 4%. So that blends to about 3.2%. We forecasted the other 20% at less than half that. So we have a 3.5% rate increase built into our 2024 guidance. And that was exactly commensurate with trend, trend even as influenced by the modest acuity shift that we and our state customers have observed. So pretty much business as usual. There's nothing, no medical cost category that needed to be accounted for or accommodated. It's actuarially sound rates impacted by acuity adjustments that 20 of 21 of our states included. And it was completely in line with our contemplated medical cost trend, even as influenced by an acuity shift. Mark, anything to add? David, I'll take the Marketplace question first. We were running really well in the middle of the 2023. Our experience was quite positive. So we consciously, consciously bid to grow the business modestly and moderately, as we suggested we would. And so we priced somewhat below the observed trend, not usually below the observed trend, but slightly below the observed trend, to essentially invest some of the excess margin. We earned nearly 10% pre-tax in that business in 2023. So in a sense, we invested some of the excess margin in growth, hence the 31% membership growth and 17% revenue growth. Mark, on the phasing -- quarterly phasing? Hi, Sarah. I'll kick it to Mark for we have very detailed analysis of the changes in the risk adjustment rules and what it meant for our book. In answer to your second question, one of the reasons I articulated earlier the configuration of our book of business being somewhat different than what I call mainstream Medicare Advantage is that we have a low income, high acuity population. Our members are using services from the first day of the year to the last day of the year. They're chronic. They have comorbidities and are polychronic. And so the notion of discretionary utilization means far less to our business based on its mix than it might be to a mainstream population where discretionary or the pedic procedures are being done, screenings are taking place, perhaps, and up demand from the pandemic. In our book of highly chronic patients, high acuity members, that's less of a dynamic. And so the three cost categories that I articulated previously, LTSS hours, high cost drugs, GLP-1s, and the supplemental benefits were really the drivers in our book. Mark, do you want to take the risk adjustment question? I'm not quite sure I've captured the essence of your question, but we are forecasting a 78% MCR for the year, which is at the low end of our long-term target range, which means we'll be operating high single-digit margins, certainly not the 10% pre-tax we achieved in 2023. But look, if you grow the book more aggressively, more of your members are going to be new to the book. And so you have to -- in our view, you have to strike a balance about how fast you're going to grow it and how many new members you want. Every new member that comes in, you need to find risk adjustment. If they come in during SEP, if they're chronic, you better find risk adjustment quickly or they won't get the profitability in the near term. So there's a -- very much a balance between what you get in annual enrollment, what you pick up in SEP, and how one thinks about how fast do I grow the book to achieve mid-single-digit margins when the maturity of the membership and the duration of the membership is pretty important to the stability of the risk pool. You have to balance those two factors. I'm sorry, we had trouble hearing the last part of your question, George. PDP? Sure, Scott. I mean, on balance, our view is the same view that you've heard from others, is that the advance notice does not appear to be adequate to compensate for trends that we're all observing. I think in our book, if you take the CMS advance notice and project it to our book, I think we're projecting about a 50 basis point, 0.5 point of rate increase, which we believe is, along with others, is insufficient, and we'll see where the final notice comes out. It usually comes out, as you know, better than that. But our view is not any different from anybody else's. But I would say that we're not anticipating in any analysis when completed on rates that would move us off of achieving the $1 accretion in the third full year of ownership. We're pretty confident in that trajectory."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJoe Krocheski: Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare\u2019s third quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina\u2019s President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our third quarter earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those of you who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that all of the remarks made are as of today, Thursday, October 26, 2023, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our third quarter 2023 earnings release. During the call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2023 guidance, Medicaid redeterminations, our recent RFP awards and related revenue growth, our 2024 outlook, our recent acquisitions and M&A activity, our long-term growth strategy and our embedded earnings power and margins. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. That could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report filed with the SEC as well as our risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?\nJoe Zubretsky: Thank you, Joe, and good morning. Today, I will provide updates on several topics. Our financial results for the third quarter 2023, our full year 2023 guidance, Medicaid redeterminations, our growth initiatives and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth and our 2024 premium outlook. Let me start with our third quarter performance. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of $5.05 or 16% year-over-year growth on $8.2 billion of premium revenue. Our results reflect the continued execution of our strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Our third quarter 88.7% consolidated MCR and 4.6% adjusted pretax margin demonstrate continued strong medical and operating cost management. Our year-to-date consolidated MCR of 87.8% is squarely in line with our long-term target range and our 5.1% pretax margin is above the high end of the range. We note that investment income continues to bolster our year-over-year earnings growth and already a strong margin profile. Our Medicaid business performed as we expected. Our 88.8% MCR was within our long-term target range. Medical cost trend including the net effect of redetermination acuity shifts in corridors in several states was within our expectations. Medicare\u2019s results came in below our expectations with a reported MCR of 92.4%. In the quarter, we continue to experience higher utilization of outpatient, professional and in-home services, all of which we believe we appropriately addressed in our 2024 bids. And finally, marketplace with a reported MCR of 78.9% continues to perform well. Medical cost trends are in line with our pricing assumptions, and our improved risk adjustment performance is meaningful. Our small silver stable strategy is working. In summary, our third quarter results build on our strong first half performance. Turning now to our 2023 guidance. Based on our third quarter results, we are affirming our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $20.75 or 16% growth year-over-year, consistent with our long-term earnings per share growth target of 15% to 18%. Our fourth quarter outlook takes full account of our year-to-date performance and considerations for seasonality and conservatism. Now a few words about Medicaid redeterminations. As of July, all our Medicaid states have begun disenrolling members. Despite the redetermination activity, our third quarter Medicaid membership was nearly unchanged from the second quarter. Growth driven by the initiation of the Iowa contract and the closing of the My Choice Wisconsin acquisition offset the $200,000 member decrease from the net impact of redeterminations and new enrollment. While many uncertainties remain on the ultimate impact of redetermination, we now believe it prudent to lower our retention assumption from 50% to 40%. Mark will address implications for revenue and our unchanged outlook for $38 billion in premium revenue for next year in his remarks. Although, the medical cost profile of members who have left the Medicaid roles continues to be more favorable than the portfolio average. When combined with the impact of corridor offsets in several states, our overall Medicaid MCR was within our expectations. Mark will provide more color on redeterminations during his remarks. Turning now to an update on our growth initiatives and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth, beginning with our recent state wins. The implementation of our new California contract, which will nearly double the size of our current membership in the state and add approximately $2 billion in annual premium is proceeding as planned for a January 1, 2024 start date. In July, we finalized our contract for the Texas STAR+ program, retaining our entire existing footprint. With numerous new entrants likely attracting low share, we expect our share of membership in the state to grow, driving incremental annual premium revenue of approximately $400 million. Also in July, we successfully launched our Iowa health plan serving approximately 180,000 members, consistent with our expectations. Our Nebraska implementation is tracking to a successful launch on January 1, 2024, and will contribute estimated annual premium of $600 million. In August, we announced that we will once again be serving Medicaid beneficiaries in the state of New Mexico. We expect the new contract to begin mid-2024 and produce approximately $500 million in annual premium revenue. In Indiana, the state deemed us not to have met the readiness requirements for a Medicaid contract due to our Medicare DSNP product becoming available in the state on January 1, 2025, and not by January 1, 2024, as required. We are proud to have won the initial award as testimony to our proposal skills, but disappointed we did not meet that one readiness requirement. Our growth agenda is in full gear. Even with the development in Indiana and changing assumptions for redetermination retention, all of these new contract wins and reprocurements combined keep us on track to approximately $38 billion of premium revenue in 2024, as previously forecasted. Shifting to our M&A activity. In early September, we announced the closing of the My Choice Wisconsin acquisition. Recall, this transaction adds approximately 40,000 mostly MLTSS members and approximately $1 billion in annual premium revenue. The regulatory approval process for the Bright Medicare acquisition is proceeding as planned. We continue to work with Bright management on satisfying the remaining closing conditions and continue to expect to close by the first quarter of 2024. Now looking ahead to 2024. Assuming a timely close of the Bright Medicare acquisition, we remain confident that all of the known building blocks provide line of sight to approximately $38 billion of premium revenue in 2024, which represents 19% year-over-year growth, even before executing on additional strategic initiatives. While there are many positive earnings catalysts going into next year, which Mark will speak to in a moment. There are also some factors, which has not yet fully developed. As is customary, we will provide our specific earnings guidance with you in February. Recall that at our Investor Day earlier this year, we announced our long-term financial targets, the centerpiece of which is a long-term earnings per share compound annual growth rate of 15% to 18%. With the visibility we have into our earnings trajectory, we are comfortable in reaffirming our commitment to that compound annual growth rate target over the next three years. As always, I would like to thank our management team who worked tirelessly every day to deliver these results. Our team has evolved to keep pace with our growth and to execute each stage of our strategy. Recall that most recently, we promoted both Jim Woys and Mark Keim to the position of Senior Executive Vice President with Jim adding the title of Chief Operating Officer. In further shaping our lineup under Jim and Mark, two Molina veterans, Executive Vice President, Deb Bacon; and Dave Reynolds will now lead our flagship Medicaid business. We are also adding additional management talent in our Medicare and Marketplace businesses and scaling up our integration platform, all to support our substantial growth. Marc Russo will be leaving the company with our thanks for his service. Not only our executive team, but all of our colleagues throughout the enterprise and across the nation are vital to our success. I want to extend my special thanks to our nearly 18,000 associates who are dedicated to deliver access to high quality healthcare to our members. It is my privilege to serve with such a committed and capable group of professionals. In summary, we are very pleased with our performance this quarter. We have maintained our attractive margin profile during this unprecedented industry-wide redetermination process, while continuing to generate double digit growth. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark?\nMark Keim: Thanks, Joe, and good morning everyone. Today I\u2019ll discuss some additional details of our third quarter performance, the balance sheet and our 2023 guidance and embedded earnings. I\u2019ll also provide an update on redeterminations, our 2024 premium revenue outlook and some early thoughts on the drivers of 2024 earnings. Beginning with our third quarter results. For the quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.05 and a consolidated MCR of 88.7%. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was 88.8%. The MCR included a moderate impact from the net effect of redetermination acuity shifts and corridors in several states. Our third quarter MCR was also slightly elevated from a provisional retroactive rate adjustment in New York State. Across our Medicaid segment, the major medical cost categories were largely in line with our expectation and normal quarter-to-quarter trend fluctuations. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 92.4%, above our long-term target range. During the quarter, we saw a continuation of increased utilization of outpatient professional and in-home services. Recall, we observed these trends emerging in the first and second quarters in time to inform our 2024 bids and benefit design. We are confident our 2024 bids will produce target margins next year. In Marketplace, our reported MCR was 78.9%. This strong result reflects our pricing strategy to return this business to target margins. Our enhanced focus on silver and renewal members helps us to drive strong performance and risk adjustment. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are well positioned to exceed our mid-single-digit target margins for the year. Also in Marketplace, we recorded a non-recurring charge in the quarter on our Texas Marketplace risk adjustment receivable from 2022 due to the financial difficulties of one major program participant in that state. While we have made our best estimate of the shortfall in collections, we will continue to pursue regulatory paths to collecting the full receivable due to us. Given it\u2019s unusual and one-time nature, we have excluded it from our adjusted earnings. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7.1 consistent with our expectations. This result includes new business implementation spending for new contract wins in Iowa, as well as several new contracts beginning in 2024. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. We harvested approximately $175 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter and used a similar amount for our Wisconsin acquisition leaving our parent company cash balance unchanged quarter-over-quarter at approximately $0.5 billion. Debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged at just 1.6x trailing 12 month EBITDA with our debt-to-cap ratio at 38.3%. Net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.3x and 33.2% reflecting our low leverage position and ample cash and capital capacity for additional growth and investment. Turning to reserves. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and we continue to be confident in the strength of our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 51, elevated from normal levels due to the inclusion of My Choice Wisconsin and our new Iowa plan. Adjusted for this temporary impact, our reported DCP would have been consistent with Q1 and Q2 levels. Now some additional color on our 2023 guidance and embedded earnings. We\u2019re affirming our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $20.75. Our full year guidance now effectively the remaining fourth quarter reflects our third quarter results, which were largely consistent with our expectations and includes considerations for seasonality and conservatism. New store embedded earnings remains unchanged at $5.50 per share, comprised of $4 for our recent new contract wins and $1.50 for acquisitions. The $4 per share for our new contract wins now includes approximately $0.50 for the combination of Texas STAR+PLUS and New Mexico replacing the same amount previously expected from the Indiana contract. The $1.50 per share of acquisition earnings includes achieving full run rate accretion from AgeWell, My Choice and Bright Health\u2019s Medicare business. Turning to redeterminations. As we discussed on prior calls, we have built robust tracking and monitoring systems to maximize retention of members who meet the eligibility criteria and to also promptly understand any financial impacts of redeterminations. Across our states approximately one-third of our members reviewed have been termed, of which over 70% have been procedural disenrollment rather than due to verification of actual ineligibility. As a result, we are seeing nearly 30% of those termed being reconnected, and we expect these numbers to grow. In the quarter, we estimate that we lost approximately 200,000 members due to the net impact of redeterminations bringing the year-to-date figure to approximately 300,000. Given the high number of procedural terminations and increasing state and CMS interventions, we expect reconnects will likely continue decreasing currently reported membership losses. As we interact with members who lose eligibility, we seek to warm transfer them to our Marketplace team for potential enrollment in that product. Throughout the process, we are seeing an increasing rate of former Medicaid members, both ours and our competitors enroll in our Marketplace products. Turning to our observations on the margin impact of redeterminations. We see that terminated members have lower medical costs than the portfolio average. However, combined with the impact of corridors in several states, the net effects from acuity shifts remains well within our expectations and our overall MCR outlook for the year. Of course, as trends have emerged, we are working with our state partners to ensure rates reflect the impact of redeterminations either prospectively in the normal fiscal year rate cycle, off cycle or retrospectively if necessary. In our states through the end of September 10 of 12 with draft or final rates have included an acuity adjustment with several considering retroactive or mid-cycle adjustments. Lastly, some additional color on 2024 starting with our premium revenue outlook. As Joe mentioned, we have line of sight to the building blocks that are expected to deliver approximately $38 billion in premium revenue for 2024 or approximately 19% growth off our 2023 premium guidance of $32 billion. These building blocks include $1.1 billion of organic growth in our current footprint, plus approximately $4 billion from our recent state contract wins with the expected premium from our Texas STAR+PLUS and New Mexico contracts, largely replacing the approximately $500 million that we had previously projected from Indiana next year. This we add approximately $2.4 billion of acquisition related premium consisting of [Audio Dip] of My Choice Wisconsin and the Bright California Medicare acquisition. Partially offsetting these growth drivers is $1.6 billion for the impact of redeterminations and known pharmacy carve-outs. We have revised our original 50% retention assumption to 40% reflecting the earlier redetermination activity we have seen and a generally conservative approach to forecasting. While this changing assumption will lower 2024 premium revenue by $300 million, we expect that gains in marketplace through increasing cross-sell and SEP and an expected strong OEP will effectively offset this result. We maintain our $38 billion in premium revenue outlook for 2024. Finally, some early thoughts on the drivers of 2024 earnings. We note the following elements that will positively influence our 2024 earnings trajectory. We have a solid 2023 earnings baseline off of which to grow. Our new store embedded earnings remain unchanged at $5.50 and continue to provide meaningful visibility into our future earnings growth potential. Investment income will likely continue to be strong. We believe our Medicare performance will improve as a result of our 2024 bids. And the impact of new business implementation costs of $0.75 a share this year go away as we begin recording premium revenue on our new business wins. However, there are some remaining variables as we close 2023 and move into 2024. First, our 2024 outlook will be better informed with another quarter of redetermination activity observed. Second, rates impacting 60% of our 2024 Medicaid premium revenue are still unknown, but we are confident that the principle of actuarial soundness will prevail, including appropriate acuity adjustments for redeterminations. We do note that rates have been finalized to date have generally been satisfactory. Finally, the first year earnings contribution from the Bright acquisition is still under review. In summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance and the momentum we have established toward achieving our growth targets. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Thanks. Good morning. I want to pick up on that last thread around the exchange growth from the redeterminations and what you\u2019re seeing early. I\u2019m curious in terms of trends and members coming in. And then is it fair to assume that that would be better risk? They\u2019re coming into your product and they\u2019ve probably been previously insured, right, coming out of Medicaid? And then I\u2019m just curious if this early experience, I understand a little less retention, does that change your view of the exchanges in 2024? I think last quarter you said that they would be relatively low growth in terms of premiums for 2024.\nJoe Zubretsky: Josh, when it comes to the exchange business in the special enrollment period, we are seeing an increase in special enrollment, monthly special enrollment. It was averaging 8,000 to 9,000 a month until the redetermination process happened, and it\u2019s increased to 12,000 a month and growing. So we are getting membership flow into the Marketplace from Medicaid redeterminations, not only from our book of business, but from competitors\u2019 book of business. We do have a product and every place we have a Medicaid footprint. But in many cases that product isn\u2019t as competitive \u2013 competitively priced as competitors. So where we\u2019re competitively priced we\u2019re getting Medicaid membership from other competitors, and we\u2019re getting Medicaid \u2013 Marketplace membership from our own book of business. So we\u2019re pretty pleased that we did not forecast Marketplace membership growth. We continued it upside to our membership case and we\u2019re seeing a nice result there. Mark, anything to add?\nMark Keim: Sure. Josh, I added about 40,000 members through SEP in the quarter compared to the 200,000 net we lost in Medicaid. So if you put some conversion rate on how many of the 40,000 came from our Medicaid book or someone else\u2019s Medicaid book, that conversion rate is pretty good. Call it, 15% or 20%. On the rate that they\u2019re coming in at, it looks like they\u2019re coming in pretty much at our portfolio run rate within Marketplace. We\u2019re not seeing pent-up demand or anything like that. So we\u2019re liking the pickup and the implications for future volume and those margins, so far are looking pretty good to us.\nJoe Zubretsky: The second part of your question, Josh, you asked about the retention percentage. We just followed the data and with 300,000 membership losses to date, the first thing we say is it\u2019s ill-advised to extrapolate any current result. Many of our states front loaded the process and by front loading we mean they specifically targeted members more likely to lose eligibility. And the fact that 70% of the terminations were procedural means that the reconnect rate has been high averaging 25% and now moving to 30% of those members who have lost eligibility. So we just followed the data and we originally said we would lose 400,000 of the 800,000 members we gained during the pandemic, and now that number has increased to 480,000. And I suppose that would mean that it is likely that whatever we\u2019re seeing in terms of Marketplace pickup would likely increase as well.\nJosh Raskin: Perfect. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I guess two questions. One, within the Medicaid business as you talked about how MLR is coming in line with expectations seems like every time we do that, you also mentioned that net of risk corridors and things like that. Is there any way to quantify what the pressure would\u2019ve been without the offset of risk corridors? And then as far as the MA commentary, it sounds like you\u2019re saying Q3 came in worse, but you still caught it in time for your bid. So I\u2019m trying to figure out how MLR in Q3 could be higher than expectations, but not be a problem for 2024 if you submitted bids in June? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: On the Medicaid MLR, I\u2019ll kick it to Mark here for more color. But as we\u2019ve always said and we made a big point of this at Investor Day. On the pre-COVID minimum MLRs and corridors that set sort of an industry benchmark of medical margin performance. We have routinely outperformed those benchmarks, which gives rise to a payback to the state in the form of a liability in many of our states. And some of those corridors we\u2019re deep into them, meaning that we\u2019re in the 100% tier. So with that having been said, if performance deteriorates during the year for any reason, whether it\u2019s an acuity shift for redetermination, whether it\u2019s a trend inflection, whether it\u2019s flu or COVID for whatever reason that liability acts as sort of the first financial cushion to absorb it before rates pick up, meaning the acuity adjustments, trend assumptions, always being baked into rates, fulfilling the concept of actuarial soundness. And we\u2019ve said that from the beginning of this process that this is developing exactly as planned. We knew there\u2019d be an acuity shift, manageable and modest as it is, and would put pressure on the underlying MCR. Our corridor liabilities would act as the first point of financial cushion until the rate process takes full credit of the acuity shift and trend. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening today.\nMark Keim: Right. And just to put a little color around that. If in normal times you\u2019re booking corridor expense and underlying trend increases quarter-to-quarter in our situation, I\u2019ll just book less corridor expense. But it is important to note, I still booked meaningful corridor expense in the third quarter. So it\u2019s not like the corridors have completely been offset. We\u2019re still booking corridor expense and we still have a significant ultimate on those liabilities. Now, as Joe mentioned that corridor works well in the current fiscal year and that it\u2019s about the new rate cycle. But remember, we tend to be best-in-class margins, which means that new rate cycle always works for us and replenishes our corridor position and keeps us in the mode we\u2019re currently running.\nJoe Zubretsky: Kevin, the second part of your question was on the Medicare MCR, which admittedly ran hot in the quarter at 92.4% and was running in the high 80s earlier in the year. We\u2019re still on target to produce 2.5% to 3% pre-tax margins in that business. It should be twice that, our target is 5% to 6% pre-tax. And yes, we saw some trend inflections in the third quarter that were higher than we observed in the first part of the year. But we\u2019re conservative pricers. We caught some of these trends early in the year, whether outpatient, professional services, screenings and PCP visits are back both on the medical side and on the behavioral side. And LTSS hours, the hours assigned to the frail members who are getting in-home services increased slightly in the quarter. All in, we believe we captured a conservative view of medical cost trend, which right now is running at 7% year-over-year higher than we had expected, but we believe we\u2019ve captured that in our 2024 bids and fully expect our Medicare business to be back to 5% to 6% pre-tax margins in 2024.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Great. Good morning. Thanks for the questions and thanks for the detail on the earnings drivers for next year. Joe, I think you kind of framed the 15% to 18% EPS growth is the average over the next three years. I guess, could you maybe just go into a little bit more detail on sort of the biggest unknowns from your point of view on that could impact growth next year relative to that that 15% to 18% range? And then just a quick clarification, on the retroactive rate adjustment in New York is it possible to quantify what impact that had in the quarter? And do you see a potential for an adjustment to this going forward potentially to be more favorable? Thank you.\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, Nathan. I\u2019ll provide the framing and then kick it to Mark. And I think Mark gave some of the building blocks in his prepared remarks. First and foremost, we\u2019re very confident in the $38 billion revenue outlook for next year. That\u2019s 19% year-over-year growth in a year where we\u2019re still producing best-in-class margins. First, I would say we\u2019re starting with a very high quality solid 2023 earnings baseline. We generally grow organically in our footprint, embedded earnings of $5.50 a share of both new store, both M&A and new contract wins is certainly a catalyst into next year. Those implementation costs of $0.75 reverse. We believe interest rates will continue to be high. Bear in mind that half our investible base is in intermediate term bonds, so they\u2019re locked in, and then the rates on the short-term portfolio are going to fluctuate with what the Fed does. But our outlook there is that interest rates will remain high going into next year, even to the end of next year. The three variables that we need to see more of before giving a specific earnings per share forecast for 2024 is how does redetermination experience emerge in the fourth quarter? To date, it has been completely in line with our expectation. We did increase our ultimate loss assumption as spoken. And we\u2019d like to see how the rates develop on our 60% of our Medicaid revenue for next year. We know about rates on 40% of our Medicaid revenue next year. Those rates have been actuarially sound. We\u2019ve been satisfied with the acuity adjustments. As Mark said, those acuity adjustments were resident in 10 out of the 12 rates that we already know about. But we want to see how the rates develop on 60% of the book. So those are the variables going into next year. As you cited at the beginning of your question, we are confident and committed to the 15% to 18% long-term earnings per share growth rate off the 2023 baseline, which means that 2026 earnings per share will be 52% to 64% higher than 2023 of $20.75. Mark, anything to add?\nMark Keim: Yeah, the only other thing Nathan, I think you asked about the rate adjustment in New York. We reported as you know an 88.8% in Medicaid for the quarter. I\u2019d estimate someplace around 30 bps is related to that specific phenomenon. And the reason it\u2019s a little uncertain is in several of our states the retro rates constantly get revisited. I\u2019m optimistic that this one gets a little bit better, but at the moment we book that adjustment.\nNathan Rich: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Good morning. Sorry about that. Appreciate the question here. The \u2013 two things I wanted to touch on were \u2013 you had a fair amount of prior year development in the third quarter kind of abnormally high relative to previous. Just curious what segments of the business might have drove that and the potential impact to earnings there. And then secondly on, Joe, you mentioned investment income. I\u2019m curious as you\u2019re having these conversations with the states on rates. Just want to confirm, like historically my understanding is states didn\u2019t really take when they set your margin \u2013 your rates actuarially sound with a margin target behind it. That margin target was before investment income. Are they looking at investment income and say, geez, maybe we could pay you a little bit less because your earnings are higher because of the investment income? Or is that still left outside of the calculation? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: I\u2019ll answer the second question first. Investment income is not only generally, but almost entirely outside the conversation of rates, which generally focused on what we call medical margin or trend assumptions. In some cases they also focus on a G&A load, but that\u2019s rare and infrequent. On the PYD, I\u2019ll kick it to Mark because we\u2019re very confident in the strength of our balance sheet. Two points I\u2019ll make. From a business perspective, our payment integrity routines are both prepay and postpay. In a postpay routine where you identify things that you should not have paid for and recover it from providers. By definition, that is accounted for in prior period development because it relates to prior periods. That is a large share of any prior period development that we report. Second point to note is, don\u2019t forget, we have corridor liabilities relating to some of these prior periods. And to the extent that PYD went against a state in a period where a corridor liability existed, then it was muted in terms of its financial impact.\nMark Keim: That that\u2019s exactly right, payment integrity has become such a fundamental part of our operations and we do it fairly well. That prior year amount that you pulled from the earnings release was largely offset by corridors. Now, more to the point when we see strong prior period development, it\u2019s tempting to be concerned about current reserving. Did they somehow offset to make earnings, something like that? Look, I\u2019d point to the strength of our current reserve position, 51 days, DCP the growth versus revenue. So I feel both good about our current reserving position, but the strength of this prior year exercise as well through our payment integrity function.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Calvin Sternick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nCalvin Sternick: Yes. Thanks. Maybe just switching gears here a little bit. I\u2019m curious what you\u2019re seeing in the cohort of members who haven\u2019t reconnected within that 90 to 120 day window, but realize afterwards that they\u2019re still eligible for Medicaid. What are the membership additions looking like there relative to what you expected? And I know you\u2019ve talked about in the past investing in quality initiatives to move up in the auto sign algorithms. So just wondering if you\u2019re seeing those efforts bear fruit here or if it\u2019s still too early to tell or just too much noise going on with redeterminations?\nJoe Zubretsky: I think you answered the question in your last statement. Because the gap is 90 to 120 days, we\u2019ve seen very little of it, given that the redetermination was in full throws, May and June. But your supposition \u2013 your theoretical supposition is correct. That member is going to go to the doctor or to the pharmacy for a service or a script realize they don\u2019t have service and then reconnect obviously with no retroactivity back to the data termination. So we suspect that member will come back in somewhere around the portfolio average because they\u2019ll be requiring services. Anything to add Mark?\nMark Keim: Yes. When we talk about reconnect, just to set the stage for everybody, we tend to think about two categories, most of them are what we call seamless that is within 90 to 120 days, they realized they lost coverage, contacted the agency and got back on as though they never lost coverage and we pick up the retro premium. Now as Joe mentioned, we\u2019re only three, four, five months into this dynamic. So the people that are outside the 90 to 120 day window are only starting to emerge now. We call those reconnects with a gap. They will come in through the typical auto assign process. And through a number of algorithms, we\u2019re getting better and better on auto-assigns in states. So I feel good about our recapture of those reconnects with the gap.\nCalvin Sternick: Thanks. If I can just ask a follow-up, and I apologize if I asked this is nitpicking a little bit, but you said the rates are generally satisfactory. Was that just a hedge against New York, maybe coming in a little bit lower? Just curious what you\u2019re seeing on the rest of the book if some things are generally better, in line or if you have something on the other side that aren\u2019t as good as you expected. Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: I think we use the word generally, obviously, because we were reporting a retroactive rate that not only us but the entire industry is advocating a guest. So that was the reason for the term. But for the most part, about 40% of rates that we know about that impact 40% of our revenue for 2024 in the Medicaid business, the rates have been actuarially sound and have included what we consider to be actuarially reasonable adjustments for acuity.\nCalvin Sternick: Great, thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: Yes, hi, thanks for the question. I just wanted to come back to the acuity discussion. I think you mentioned it was running in line with your expectations at this point. I guess, how do you think about the higher level of procedural disenrollments, having impacted that? I guess like how much does that make it challenging for you to feel like you have good visibility there at this point? And then I think you mentioned that the reconnect population you expected, the MLRs there will be in line with sort of like the rest of the stayers. I guess, do you have data at this point to support that? Or can you look back and see what utilizations look like over the past couple of years for those people. So I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s based on data at this point or it\u2019s still kind of a working period? Thank you.\nMark Keim: So on the reconnects themselves, we\u2019re seeing them come back in closer to the stayers average, the portfolio average. Now I appreciate your question about historical benchmarks of data, but the problem is over the last two to three years, we didn\u2019t really have such a phenomena. But I am feeling pretty good about the MLR of these reconnects, both seamless and with the gap.\nJoe Zubretsky: The other \u2013 maybe the last point to make on this point is a really important one. Durational acuity and lever stayers and joiners is not a new phenomenon to tracking a book of business. It\u2019s just that in this environment, it\u2019s more important to track it and to be able to forecast it. People come in to Medicaid because they need services, they can end higher than the portfolio average. And by the time they leave, they\u2019re using fewer services and leaving out lower than the portfolio average. That\u2019s the way the business works. And we have produced through all of that, on average, 88% \u2013 between 88% and 89%, 88.5% on average MCR. That\u2019s the way the business works. The issue here is because of the redetermination pause during the PHE, there\u2019s twice as many people leaving than joining. So this has always been a phenomenon. We\u2019ve had tracking mechanisms for durational acuity. We understand the levers, stayers and joiners analysis really well. But it is very early in the process. And I come back to the point we made earlier. It is ill-advised to mathematically extrapolate any of these data points, certain states front-loaded the process. And as you suggested, with the procedural termination rate being so high, the reconnect rate is higher than anybody expected and likely growing.\nOperator: Next question comes from Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Would appreciate if you can just give us sort of, I guess, your sense on your comfort levels right now with the current performance and then the bid positioning of the Bright Medicare asset that you\u2019re going to be acquiring. And maybe just sort of talk about how you\u2019re thinking about sort of factoring that into your 2024 outlook and maybe some of the downside protections that exist if that performance does come in, let\u2019s say, a bit meaningfully below optimal levels. Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: So Scott, we\u2019re very pleased with the strategic complement to our Medicare business, taking it from a $4 billion business to nearly a $6 billion business in a very important state for us, obviously, in California, where we\u2019re doubling the size of our Medicaid business. So from a strategic rationale perspective, we\u2019re very excited about it. In our embedded earnings is a run rate accretion level of $1 of earnings per share, ultimately, given the way the CMS pricing cycle works, it is going to take us a little longer than normal to get there, but we\u2019re confident in doing so. I\u2019ll stop short on commenting about their financial performance. They\u2019re a public company. This is a material to their operations. So I would allow them to report on how they\u2019re doing. But we do have visibility into how they\u2019re performing. And when we said that one of the variables going into next year is how will it perform in the first year. We don\u2019t yet know because we don\u2019t know where it will be performing when we close on it. I\u2019ll stop short of commenting on their performance because that would be inappropriate. Obviously, they\u2019ll report earnings soon, and you can get a view as to how the Medicare business is doing.\nOperator: Our next question next question comes from A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Just maybe to ask about the exchanges a bit more. It sounds like you\u2019ve got some conservatism, at least you believe you have in the fourth quarter baked in. I know you\u2019ve been running a pretty low MCR year-to-date and exchanges. Are you allowing for significant uptick? Sometimes we see that utilization. Obviously, as people hit their deductible limits, et cetera, and exchanges. Can you give us any sense of what you\u2019ve baked in? And I think the comment was made and as you look ahead to 2024, you\u2019re not expecting a lot of premium growth, it seems like you\u2019ve repriced the business pretty well. Why not take a little more active approach to growing that product line next year, given it sounds like you\u2019re hitting your margin targets pretty easily this year in that product? Or maybe I\u2019m missing something.\nJoe Zubretsky: So yes, you aren\u2019t missing anything. Thanks for the question. Let me frame it in terms of you asked two questions, one about the MCR and one about membership growth. On the MCR, when we gave guidance at the end of the second quarter, we built in roughly an 85% back half MCR. And obviously, we outperformed that in the third quarter. We continue to bake in something in the mid-80s for the fourth quarter, which would put us at 76% for the full year, which is 200 basis points below the low end of the range. This business is going to produce 8.5% to 9% pretax margins for the year. Small, silver and stable work given the potential for inherent volatility in the risk pool, I think we have this right. Now to your point, Mark mentioned it in his prepared remarks and some, but he mentioned it, that we do plan to grow the marketplace business next year. We plan to grow it measuredly and modestly. The early read on our pricing competitiveness. I\u2019ll just give you one stat that\u2019s really important. In our Silver product, which is our flagship product, we are now number one or number two priced in 30% of our counties versus 20% this year. It will grow next year. We plan to do it measurably and modestly, all with the view are producing at least mid-single-digit pretax margins, which this year will be very high single-digit pretax margins. Anything to add Mark?\nMark Keim: A.J., the only thing I\u2019d add is Joe has been adamant about small, stable and silver in this product. And so when we set rates last June, we set them on our discipline on our margin expectations. It looks like the risk pool next year is stabilizing with some of the more strangely players dropping out, which means the risk pool for the rest of us has stabilized as a result on pricing we committed to last June, we\u2019re seeing a much better competitive position. Joe mentioned 20% of our county is now growing to 30%, where we\u2019re number one or number two, which means I\u2019m expecting to get more volume than I thought before at margins that conform with our discipline. So we\u2019re feeling good about that outlook.\nA.J. Rice: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Hey, good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. I guess with respect to the retrospective rate adjustments that you guys talked about, is there any way to quantify both how far you guys are through the process? And simplistically speaking, I guess, how much money you guys think you might be owed from rate adjustments that kind of didn\u2019t \u2013 that need to be trued up historically?\nMark Keim: I\u2019ll take that. Obviously, I\u2019m in no position to comment on retro rates that haven\u2019t been contractually committed to by our state partners. But with our actuarial team and our data-driven process, we\u2019re in there working with them. And I\u2019d say there\u2019s a handful right now where the data is compelling. The state is receptive to the discussion. We\u2019ll let that play out. And of course, I\u2019ll book those benefits if and when they come.\nGeorge Hill: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gary Taylor from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. I had two questions. One was just on the $5.50 of embedded earnings, which I think you reiterated I think a portion of that historically was Indiana that might have only been sort of $0.15 or $0.20. So I just wanted to make sure understanding what sort of backfilling that to keep the embedded earnings at $5.50. And also, if you would agree, it sounds like maybe just the Bright year one profitability is the biggest I guess, question mark right now in terms of how much of that embedded earnings will get realized in 2024. Is that fair?\nJoe Zubretsky: First question, Gary, this is Joe. Yes, as embedded earnings, you\u2019re absolutely right. We removed Indiana from embedded earnings but replaced it with New Mexico and an expansion in Texas now that the contract is finalized. And yes, as I said, we\u2019re very confident that we can get Bright to target margins after a two-year period and achieve the $1 earnings per share accretion number. And again, we\u2019re just saying that we just don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to inherit in terms of earnings per share closing to forecast the first year.\nMark Keim: And given that company is going into OEP themselves, they\u2019re probably still working through what their outlook is for next year. So it\u2019s definitely too early given the situation for us to comment on that one.\nGary Taylor: Thank you.\nOperator: The last question comes from Sarah James from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\nSarah James: Thank you. One clarification on the rejoiners, can you give us a split of what\u2019s coming back in exchanges versus coming back on Medicaid? And then in the two of the 12 states that didn\u2019t put in the acuity adjustments, are you able to see any pattern there, either in how the cost that is coming in, maybe the timing that they started redeterminations or how the rate is structured with risk corridors that you\u2019re able to determine maybe why those two were outliers?\nJoe Zubretsky: I\u2019ll kick it to Mark for the cover on these, but the first point I\u2019ll make is on your second question. I think we appropriately need to include the word yet in the two that haven\u2019t. Bear in mind, some of our rate cycle actually incepts only as the redetermination process starting even before it started, which makes it not possible for any Medicaid department to project what the acuity shift would be. So I would introduce the word yet. And who knows, maybe we\u2019ll get a retro or a mid-cycle adjustment on those two states. Mark?\nMark Keim: Hey Sarah, on the reconnects, when we use the term reconnects, both seamless and with a gap, that is purely a Medicaid concept. So that 25% going to 30% that we\u2019re seeing is strictly within Medicaid \u2013 then separately, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re picking up members in the marketplace. I mentioned closer to 40,000 through SEP in the third quarter. So that would be a different concept. And obviously, as an enterprise, only helps \u2013 in the overall membership story. And then Joe is exactly right, on the two of the 12 states where we haven\u2019t seen it yet, there\u2019s a few things driving that. The timing of when folks started impacts how quickly data develops to have a data-driven process. The timing of the fiscal year is definitely a component, but in all cases, the concept of actuarial sales just means it\u2019s a matter of getting the data into timing consistent with fiscal years and appropriate retro periods. So we feel good about that process. And again, the vast majority have already given us those concessions. So we feel good about how the process will unfold.\nSarah James: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Keim",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and good morning everyone. Today I'll discuss some additional details of our third quarter performance, the balance sheet and our 2023 guidance and embedded earnings. I'll also provide an update on redeterminations, our 2024 premium revenue outlook and some early thoughts on the drivers of 2024 earnings. Beginning with our third quarter results. For the quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.05 and a consolidated MCR of 88.7%. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was 88.8%. The MCR included a moderate impact from the net effect of redetermination acuity shifts and corridors in several states. Our third quarter MCR was also slightly elevated from a provisional retroactive rate adjustment in New York State. Across our Medicaid segment, the major medical cost categories were largely in line with our expectation and normal quarter-to-quarter trend fluctuations. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 92.4%, above our long-term target range. During the quarter, we saw a continuation of increased utilization of outpatient professional and in-home services. Recall, we observed these trends emerging in the first and second quarters in time to inform our 2024 bids and benefit design. We are confident our 2024 bids will produce target margins next year. In Marketplace, our reported MCR was 78.9%. This strong result reflects our pricing strategy to return this business to target margins. Our enhanced focus on silver and renewal members helps us to drive strong performance and risk adjustment. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are well positioned to exceed our mid-single-digit target margins for the year. Also in Marketplace, we recorded a non-recurring charge in the quarter on our Texas Marketplace risk adjustment receivable from 2022 due to the financial difficulties of one major program participant in that state. While we have made our best estimate of the shortfall in collections, we will continue to pursue regulatory paths to collecting the full receivable due to us. Given it's unusual and one-time nature, we have excluded it from our adjusted earnings. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7.1 consistent with our expectations. This result includes new business implementation spending for new contract wins in Iowa, as well as several new contracts beginning in 2024. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. We harvested approximately $175 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter and used a similar amount for our Wisconsin acquisition leaving our parent company cash balance unchanged quarter-over-quarter at approximately $0.5 billion. Debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged at just 1.6x trailing 12 month EBITDA with our debt-to-cap ratio at 38.3%. Net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.3x and 33.2% reflecting our low leverage position and ample cash and capital capacity for additional growth and investment. Turning to reserves. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and we continue to be confident in the strength of our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 51, elevated from normal levels due to the inclusion of My Choice Wisconsin and our new Iowa plan. Adjusted for this temporary impact, our reported DCP would have been consistent with Q1 and Q2 levels. Now some additional color on our 2023 guidance and embedded earnings. We're affirming our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $20.75. Our full year guidance now effectively the remaining fourth quarter reflects our third quarter results, which were largely consistent with our expectations and includes considerations for seasonality and conservatism. New store embedded earnings remains unchanged at $5.50 per share, comprised of $4 for our recent new contract wins and $1.50 for acquisitions. The $4 per share for our new contract wins now includes approximately $0.50 for the combination of Texas STAR+PLUS and New Mexico replacing the same amount previously expected from the Indiana contract. The $1.50 per share of acquisition earnings includes achieving full run rate accretion from AgeWell, My Choice and Bright Health's Medicare business. Turning to redeterminations. As we discussed on prior calls, we have built robust tracking and monitoring systems to maximize retention of members who meet the eligibility criteria and to also promptly understand any financial impacts of redeterminations. Across our states approximately one-third of our members reviewed have been termed, of which over 70% have been procedural disenrollment rather than due to verification of actual ineligibility. As a result, we are seeing nearly 30% of those termed being reconnected, and we expect these numbers to grow. In the quarter, we estimate that we lost approximately 200,000 members due to the net impact of redeterminations bringing the year-to-date figure to approximately 300,000. Given the high number of procedural terminations and increasing state and CMS interventions, we expect reconnects will likely continue decreasing currently reported membership losses. As we interact with members who lose eligibility, we seek to warm transfer them to our Marketplace team for potential enrollment in that product. Throughout the process, we are seeing an increasing rate of former Medicaid members, both ours and our competitors enroll in our Marketplace products. Turning to our observations on the margin impact of redeterminations. We see that terminated members have lower medical costs than the portfolio average. However, combined with the impact of corridors in several states, the net effects from acuity shifts remains well within our expectations and our overall MCR outlook for the year. Of course, as trends have emerged, we are working with our state partners to ensure rates reflect the impact of redeterminations either prospectively in the normal fiscal year rate cycle, off cycle or retrospectively if necessary. In our states through the end of September 10 of 12 with draft or final rates have included an acuity adjustment with several considering retroactive or mid-cycle adjustments. Lastly, some additional color on 2024 starting with our premium revenue outlook. As Joe mentioned, we have line of sight to the building blocks that are expected to deliver approximately $38 billion in premium revenue for 2024 or approximately 19% growth off our 2023 premium guidance of $32 billion. These building blocks include $1.1 billion of organic growth in our current footprint, plus approximately $4 billion from our recent state contract wins with the expected premium from our Texas STAR+PLUS and New Mexico contracts, largely replacing the approximately $500 million that we had previously projected from Indiana next year. This we add approximately $2.4 billion of acquisition related premium consisting of [Audio Dip] of My Choice Wisconsin and the Bright California Medicare acquisition. Partially offsetting these growth drivers is $1.6 billion for the impact of redeterminations and known pharmacy carve-outs. We have revised our original 50% retention assumption to 40% reflecting the earlier redetermination activity we have seen and a generally conservative approach to forecasting. While this changing assumption will lower 2024 premium revenue by $300 million, we expect that gains in marketplace through increasing cross-sell and SEP and an expected strong OEP will effectively offset this result. We maintain our $38 billion in premium revenue outlook for 2024. Finally, some early thoughts on the drivers of 2024 earnings. We note the following elements that will positively influence our 2024 earnings trajectory. We have a solid 2023 earnings baseline off of which to grow. Our new store embedded earnings remain unchanged at $5.50 and continue to provide meaningful visibility into our future earnings growth potential. Investment income will likely continue to be strong. We believe our Medicare performance will improve as a result of our 2024 bids. And the impact of new business implementation costs of $0.75 a share this year go away as we begin recording premium revenue on our new business wins. However, there are some remaining variables as we close 2023 and move into 2024. First, our 2024 outlook will be better informed with another quarter of redetermination activity observed. Second, rates impacting 60% of our 2024 Medicaid premium revenue are still unknown, but we are confident that the principle of actuarial soundness will prevail, including appropriate acuity adjustments for redeterminations. We do note that rates have been finalized to date have generally been satisfactory. Finally, the first year earnings contribution from the Bright acquisition is still under review. In summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance and the momentum we have established toward achieving our growth targets. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Sure. Josh, I added about 40,000 members through SEP in the quarter compared to the 200,000 net we lost in Medicaid. So if you put some conversion rate on how many of the 40,000 came from our Medicaid book or someone else's Medicaid book, that conversion rate is pretty good. Call it, 15% or 20%. On the rate that they're coming in at, it looks like they're coming in pretty much at our portfolio run rate within Marketplace. We're not seeing pent-up demand or anything like that. So we're liking the pickup and the implications for future volume and those margins, so far are looking pretty good to us. Right. And just to put a little color around that. If in normal times you're booking corridor expense and underlying trend increases quarter-to-quarter in our situation, I'll just book less corridor expense. But it is important to note, I still booked meaningful corridor expense in the third quarter. So it's not like the corridors have completely been offset. We're still booking corridor expense and we still have a significant ultimate on those liabilities. Now, as Joe mentioned that corridor works well in the current fiscal year and that it's about the new rate cycle. But remember, we tend to be best-in-class margins, which means that new rate cycle always works for us and replenishes our corridor position and keeps us in the mode we're currently running. Yeah, the only other thing Nathan, I think you asked about the rate adjustment in New York. We reported as you know an 88.8% in Medicaid for the quarter. I'd estimate someplace around 30 bps is related to that specific phenomenon. And the reason it's a little uncertain is in several of our states the retro rates constantly get revisited. I'm optimistic that this one gets a little bit better, but at the moment we book that adjustment. That that's exactly right, payment integrity has become such a fundamental part of our operations and we do it fairly well. That prior year amount that you pulled from the earnings release was largely offset by corridors. Now, more to the point when we see strong prior period development, it's tempting to be concerned about current reserving. Did they somehow offset to make earnings, something like that? Look, I'd point to the strength of our current reserve position, 51 days, DCP the growth versus revenue. So I feel both good about our current reserving position, but the strength of this prior year exercise as well through our payment integrity function. Yes. When we talk about reconnect, just to set the stage for everybody, we tend to think about two categories, most of them are what we call seamless that is within 90 to 120 days, they realized they lost coverage, contacted the agency and got back on as though they never lost coverage and we pick up the retro premium. Now as Joe mentioned, we're only three, four, five months into this dynamic. So the people that are outside the 90 to 120 day window are only starting to emerge now. We call those reconnects with a gap. They will come in through the typical auto assign process. And through a number of algorithms, we're getting better and better on auto-assigns in states. So I feel good about our recapture of those reconnects with the gap. So on the reconnects themselves, we're seeing them come back in closer to the stayers average, the portfolio average. Now I appreciate your question about historical benchmarks of data, but the problem is over the last two to three years, we didn't really have such a phenomena. But I am feeling pretty good about the MLR of these reconnects, both seamless and with the gap. A.J., the only thing I'd add is Joe has been adamant about small, stable and silver in this product. And so when we set rates last June, we set them on our discipline on our margin expectations. It looks like the risk pool next year is stabilizing with some of the more strangely players dropping out, which means the risk pool for the rest of us has stabilized as a result on pricing we committed to last June, we're seeing a much better competitive position. Joe mentioned 20% of our county is now growing to 30%, where we're number one or number two, which means I'm expecting to get more volume than I thought before at margins that conform with our discipline. So we're feeling good about that outlook. I'll take that. Obviously, I'm in no position to comment on retro rates that haven't been contractually committed to by our state partners. But with our actuarial team and our data-driven process, we're in there working with them. And I'd say there's a handful right now where the data is compelling. The state is receptive to the discussion. We'll let that play out. And of course, I'll book those benefits if and when they come. And given that company is going into OEP themselves, they're probably still working through what their outlook is for next year. So it's definitely too early given the situation for us to comment on that one. Hey Sarah, on the reconnects, when we use the term reconnects, both seamless and with a gap, that is purely a Medicaid concept. So that 25% going to 30% that we're seeing is strictly within Medicaid \u2013 then separately, as I mentioned earlier, we're picking up members in the marketplace. I mentioned closer to 40,000 through SEP in the third quarter. So that would be a different concept. And obviously, as an enterprise, only helps \u2013 in the overall membership story. And then Joe is exactly right, on the two of the 12 states where we haven't seen it yet, there's a few things driving that. The timing of when folks started impacts how quickly data develops to have a data-driven process. The timing of the fiscal year is definitely a component, but in all cases, the concept of actuarial sales just means it's a matter of getting the data into timing consistent with fiscal years and appropriate retro periods. So we feel good about that process. And again, the vast majority have already given us those concessions. So we feel good about how the process will unfold."

            "content": "Thank you, Joe, and good morning. Today, I will provide updates on several topics. Our financial results for the third quarter 2023, our full year 2023 guidance, Medicaid redeterminations, our growth initiatives and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth and our 2024 premium outlook. Let me start with our third quarter performance. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of $5.05 or 16% year-over-year growth on $8.2 billion of premium revenue. Our results reflect the continued execution of our strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Our third quarter 88.7% consolidated MCR and 4.6% adjusted pretax margin demonstrate continued strong medical and operating cost management. Our year-to-date consolidated MCR of 87.8% is squarely in line with our long-term target range and our 5.1% pretax margin is above the high end of the range. We note that investment income continues to bolster our year-over-year earnings growth and already a strong margin profile. Our Medicaid business performed as we expected. Our 88.8% MCR was within our long-term target range. Medical cost trend including the net effect of redetermination acuity shifts in corridors in several states was within our expectations. Medicare's results came in below our expectations with a reported MCR of 92.4%. In the quarter, we continue to experience higher utilization of outpatient, professional and in-home services, all of which we believe we appropriately addressed in our 2024 bids. And finally, marketplace with a reported MCR of 78.9% continues to perform well. Medical cost trends are in line with our pricing assumptions, and our improved risk adjustment performance is meaningful. Our small silver stable strategy is working. In summary, our third quarter results build on our strong first half performance. Turning now to our 2023 guidance. Based on our third quarter results, we are affirming our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $20.75 or 16% growth year-over-year, consistent with our long-term earnings per share growth target of 15% to 18%. Our fourth quarter outlook takes full account of our year-to-date performance and considerations for seasonality and conservatism. Now a few words about Medicaid redeterminations. As of July, all our Medicaid states have begun disenrolling members. Despite the redetermination activity, our third quarter Medicaid membership was nearly unchanged from the second quarter. Growth driven by the initiation of the Iowa contract and the closing of the My Choice Wisconsin acquisition offset the $200,000 member decrease from the net impact of redeterminations and new enrollment. While many uncertainties remain on the ultimate impact of redetermination, we now believe it prudent to lower our retention assumption from 50% to 40%. Mark will address implications for revenue and our unchanged outlook for $38 billion in premium revenue for next year in his remarks. Although, the medical cost profile of members who have left the Medicaid roles continues to be more favorable than the portfolio average. When combined with the impact of corridor offsets in several states, our overall Medicaid MCR was within our expectations. Mark will provide more color on redeterminations during his remarks. Turning now to an update on our growth initiatives and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth, beginning with our recent state wins. The implementation of our new California contract, which will nearly double the size of our current membership in the state and add approximately $2 billion in annual premium is proceeding as planned for a January 1, 2024 start date. In July, we finalized our contract for the Texas STAR+ program, retaining our entire existing footprint. With numerous new entrants likely attracting low share, we expect our share of membership in the state to grow, driving incremental annual premium revenue of approximately $400 million. Also in July, we successfully launched our Iowa health plan serving approximately 180,000 members, consistent with our expectations. Our Nebraska implementation is tracking to a successful launch on January 1, 2024, and will contribute estimated annual premium of $600 million. In August, we announced that we will once again be serving Medicaid beneficiaries in the state of New Mexico. We expect the new contract to begin mid-2024 and produce approximately $500 million in annual premium revenue. In Indiana, the state deemed us not to have met the readiness requirements for a Medicaid contract due to our Medicare DSNP product becoming available in the state on January 1, 2025, and not by January 1, 2024, as required. We are proud to have won the initial award as testimony to our proposal skills, but disappointed we did not meet that one readiness requirement. Our growth agenda is in full gear. Even with the development in Indiana and changing assumptions for redetermination retention, all of these new contract wins and reprocurements combined keep us on track to approximately $38 billion of premium revenue in 2024, as previously forecasted. Shifting to our M&A activity. In early September, we announced the closing of the My Choice Wisconsin acquisition. Recall, this transaction adds approximately 40,000 mostly MLTSS members and approximately $1 billion in annual premium revenue. The regulatory approval process for the Bright Medicare acquisition is proceeding as planned. We continue to work with Bright management on satisfying the remaining closing conditions and continue to expect to close by the first quarter of 2024. Now looking ahead to 2024. Assuming a timely close of the Bright Medicare acquisition, we remain confident that all of the known building blocks provide line of sight to approximately $38 billion of premium revenue in 2024, which represents 19% year-over-year growth, even before executing on additional strategic initiatives. While there are many positive earnings catalysts going into next year, which Mark will speak to in a moment. There are also some factors, which has not yet fully developed. As is customary, we will provide our specific earnings guidance with you in February. Recall that at our Investor Day earlier this year, we announced our long-term financial targets, the centerpiece of which is a long-term earnings per share compound annual growth rate of 15% to 18%. With the visibility we have into our earnings trajectory, we are comfortable in reaffirming our commitment to that compound annual growth rate target over the next three years. As always, I would like to thank our management team who worked tirelessly every day to deliver these results. Our team has evolved to keep pace with our growth and to execute each stage of our strategy. Recall that most recently, we promoted both Jim Woys and Mark Keim to the position of Senior Executive Vice President with Jim adding the title of Chief Operating Officer. In further shaping our lineup under Jim and Mark, two Molina veterans, Executive Vice President, Deb Bacon; and Dave Reynolds will now lead our flagship Medicaid business. We are also adding additional management talent in our Medicare and Marketplace businesses and scaling up our integration platform, all to support our substantial growth. Marc Russo will be leaving the company with our thanks for his service. Not only our executive team, but all of our colleagues throughout the enterprise and across the nation are vital to our success. I want to extend my special thanks to our nearly 18,000 associates who are dedicated to deliver access to high quality healthcare to our members. It is my privilege to serve with such a committed and capable group of professionals. In summary, we are very pleased with our performance this quarter. We have maintained our attractive margin profile during this unprecedented industry-wide redetermination process, while continuing to generate double digit growth. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark? Josh, when it comes to the exchange business in the special enrollment period, we are seeing an increase in special enrollment, monthly special enrollment. It was averaging 8,000 to 9,000 a month until the redetermination process happened, and it's increased to 12,000 a month and growing. So we are getting membership flow into the Marketplace from Medicaid redeterminations, not only from our book of business, but from competitors' book of business. We do have a product and every place we have a Medicaid footprint. But in many cases that product isn't as competitive \u2013 competitively priced as competitors. So where we're competitively priced we're getting Medicaid membership from other competitors, and we're getting Medicaid \u2013 Marketplace membership from our own book of business. So we're pretty pleased that we did not forecast Marketplace membership growth. We continued it upside to our membership case and we're seeing a nice result there. Mark, anything to add? The second part of your question, Josh, you asked about the retention percentage. We just followed the data and with 300,000 membership losses to date, the first thing we say is it's ill-advised to extrapolate any current result. Many of our states front loaded the process and by front loading we mean they specifically targeted members more likely to lose eligibility. And the fact that 70% of the terminations were procedural means that the reconnect rate has been high averaging 25% and now moving to 30% of those members who have lost eligibility. So we just followed the data and we originally said we would lose 400,000 of the 800,000 members we gained during the pandemic, and now that number has increased to 480,000. And I suppose that would mean that it is likely that whatever we're seeing in terms of Marketplace pickup would likely increase as well. On the Medicaid MLR, I'll kick it to Mark here for more color. But as we've always said and we made a big point of this at Investor Day. On the pre-COVID minimum MLRs and corridors that set sort of an industry benchmark of medical margin performance. We have routinely outperformed those benchmarks, which gives rise to a payback to the state in the form of a liability in many of our states. And some of those corridors we're deep into them, meaning that we're in the 100% tier. So with that having been said, if performance deteriorates during the year for any reason, whether it's an acuity shift for redetermination, whether it's a trend inflection, whether it's flu or COVID for whatever reason that liability acts as sort of the first financial cushion to absorb it before rates pick up, meaning the acuity adjustments, trend assumptions, always being baked into rates, fulfilling the concept of actuarial soundness. And we've said that from the beginning of this process that this is developing exactly as planned. We knew there'd be an acuity shift, manageable and modest as it is, and would put pressure on the underlying MCR. Our corridor liabilities would act as the first point of financial cushion until the rate process takes full credit of the acuity shift and trend. And that's exactly what's happening today. Kevin, the second part of your question was on the Medicare MCR, which admittedly ran hot in the quarter at 92.4% and was running in the high 80s earlier in the year. We're still on target to produce 2.5% to 3% pre-tax margins in that business. It should be twice that, our target is 5% to 6% pre-tax. And yes, we saw some trend inflections in the third quarter that were higher than we observed in the first part of the year. But we're conservative pricers. We caught some of these trends early in the year, whether outpatient, professional services, screenings and PCP visits are back both on the medical side and on the behavioral side. And LTSS hours, the hours assigned to the frail members who are getting in-home services increased slightly in the quarter. All in, we believe we captured a conservative view of medical cost trend, which right now is running at 7% year-over-year higher than we had expected, but we believe we've captured that in our 2024 bids and fully expect our Medicare business to be back to 5% to 6% pre-tax margins in 2024. Sure, Nathan. I'll provide the framing and then kick it to Mark. And I think Mark gave some of the building blocks in his prepared remarks. First and foremost, we're very confident in the $38 billion revenue outlook for next year. That's 19% year-over-year growth in a year where we're still producing best-in-class margins. First, I would say we're starting with a very high quality solid 2023 earnings baseline. We generally grow organically in our footprint, embedded earnings of $5.50 a share of both new store, both M&A and new contract wins is certainly a catalyst into next year. Those implementation costs of $0.75 reverse. We believe interest rates will continue to be high. Bear in mind that half our investible base is in intermediate term bonds, so they're locked in, and then the rates on the short-term portfolio are going to fluctuate with what the Fed does. But our outlook there is that interest rates will remain high going into next year, even to the end of next year. The three variables that we need to see more of before giving a specific earnings per share forecast for 2024 is how does redetermination experience emerge in the fourth quarter? To date, it has been completely in line with our expectation. We did increase our ultimate loss assumption as spoken. And we'd like to see how the rates develop on our 60% of our Medicaid revenue for next year. We know about rates on 40% of our Medicaid revenue next year. Those rates have been actuarially sound. We've been satisfied with the acuity adjustments. As Mark said, those acuity adjustments were resident in 10 out of the 12 rates that we already know about. But we want to see how the rates develop on 60% of the book. So those are the variables going into next year. As you cited at the beginning of your question, we are confident and committed to the 15% to 18% long-term earnings per share growth rate off the 2023 baseline, which means that 2026 earnings per share will be 52% to 64% higher than 2023 of $20.75. Mark, anything to add? I'll answer the second question first. Investment income is not only generally, but almost entirely outside the conversation of rates, which generally focused on what we call medical margin or trend assumptions. In some cases they also focus on a G&A load, but that's rare and infrequent. On the PYD, I'll kick it to Mark because we're very confident in the strength of our balance sheet. Two points I'll make. From a business perspective, our payment integrity routines are both prepay and postpay. In a postpay routine where you identify things that you should not have paid for and recover it from providers. By definition, that is accounted for in prior period development because it relates to prior periods. That is a large share of any prior period development that we report. Second point to note is, don't forget, we have corridor liabilities relating to some of these prior periods. And to the extent that PYD went against a state in a period where a corridor liability existed, then it was muted in terms of its financial impact. I think you answered the question in your last statement. Because the gap is 90 to 120 days, we've seen very little of it, given that the redetermination was in full throws, May and June. But your supposition \u2013 your theoretical supposition is correct. That member is going to go to the doctor or to the pharmacy for a service or a script realize they don't have service and then reconnect obviously with no retroactivity back to the data termination. So we suspect that member will come back in somewhere around the portfolio average because they'll be requiring services. Anything to add Mark? I think we use the word generally, obviously, because we were reporting a retroactive rate that not only us but the entire industry is advocating a guest. So that was the reason for the term. But for the most part, about 40% of rates that we know about that impact 40% of our revenue for 2024 in the Medicaid business, the rates have been actuarially sound and have included what we consider to be actuarially reasonable adjustments for acuity. The other \u2013 maybe the last point to make on this point is a really important one. Durational acuity and lever stayers and joiners is not a new phenomenon to tracking a book of business. It's just that in this environment, it's more important to track it and to be able to forecast it. People come in to Medicaid because they need services, they can end higher than the portfolio average. And by the time they leave, they're using fewer services and leaving out lower than the portfolio average. That's the way the business works. And we have produced through all of that, on average, 88% \u2013 between 88% and 89%, 88.5% on average MCR. That's the way the business works. The issue here is because of the redetermination pause during the PHE, there's twice as many people leaving than joining. So this has always been a phenomenon. We've had tracking mechanisms for durational acuity. We understand the levers, stayers and joiners analysis really well. But it is very early in the process. And I come back to the point we made earlier. It is ill-advised to mathematically extrapolate any of these data points, certain states front-loaded the process. And as you suggested, with the procedural termination rate being so high, the reconnect rate is higher than anybody expected and likely growing. So Scott, we're very pleased with the strategic complement to our Medicare business, taking it from a $4 billion business to nearly a $6 billion business in a very important state for us, obviously, in California, where we're doubling the size of our Medicaid business. So from a strategic rationale perspective, we're very excited about it. In our embedded earnings is a run rate accretion level of $1 of earnings per share, ultimately, given the way the CMS pricing cycle works, it is going to take us a little longer than normal to get there, but we're confident in doing so. I'll stop short on commenting about their financial performance. They're a public company. This is a material to their operations. So I would allow them to report on how they're doing. But we do have visibility into how they're performing. And when we said that one of the variables going into next year is how will it perform in the first year. We don't yet know because we don't know where it will be performing when we close on it. I'll stop short of commenting on their performance because that would be inappropriate. Obviously, they'll report earnings soon, and you can get a view as to how the Medicare business is doing. So yes, you aren't missing anything. Thanks for the question. Let me frame it in terms of you asked two questions, one about the MCR and one about membership growth. On the MCR, when we gave guidance at the end of the second quarter, we built in roughly an 85% back half MCR. And obviously, we outperformed that in the third quarter. We continue to bake in something in the mid-80s for the fourth quarter, which would put us at 76% for the full year, which is 200 basis points below the low end of the range. This business is going to produce 8.5% to 9% pretax margins for the year. Small, silver and stable work given the potential for inherent volatility in the risk pool, I think we have this right. Now to your point, Mark mentioned it in his prepared remarks and some, but he mentioned it, that we do plan to grow the marketplace business next year. We plan to grow it measuredly and modestly. The early read on our pricing competitiveness. I'll just give you one stat that's really important. In our Silver product, which is our flagship product, we are now number one or number two priced in 30% of our counties versus 20% this year. It will grow next year. We plan to do it measurably and modestly, all with the view are producing at least mid-single-digit pretax margins, which this year will be very high single-digit pretax margins. Anything to add Mark? First question, Gary, this is Joe. Yes, as embedded earnings, you're absolutely right. We removed Indiana from embedded earnings but replaced it with New Mexico and an expansion in Texas now that the contract is finalized. And yes, as I said, we're very confident that we can get Bright to target margins after a two-year period and achieve the $1 earnings per share accretion number. And again, we're just saying that we just don't know what we're going to inherit in terms of earnings per share closing to forecast the first year. I'll kick it to Mark for the cover on these, but the first point I'll make is on your second question. I think we appropriately need to include the word yet in the two that haven't. Bear in mind, some of our rate cycle actually incepts only as the redetermination process starting even before it started, which makes it not possible for any Medicaid department to project what the acuity shift would be. So I would introduce the word yet. And who knows, maybe we'll get a retro or a mid-cycle adjustment on those two states. Mark?"

[Operator Instructions] Please note, today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Joe Krocheski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJoe Krocheski: Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare\u2019s second quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina\u2019s President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our second quarter earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that the remarks made are as of today, Thursday, July 27, 2023, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our second quarter 2023 earnings release. During our call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2023 guidance, Medicaid redeterminations, our recent RFP awards and related revenue growth, our recent acquisitions and M&A activity, our long-term growth strategy and our embedded earnings power and margins. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?\nJoe Zubretsky: Thank you, Joe, and good morning. Today we will provide updates on our financial results for the second quarter 2023, our full year 2023 guidance in the context of our second quarter results, Medicaid redeterminations and our growth initiatives, and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth, including our 2024 premium revenue growth drivers. Let me begin with the second quarter highlights. Last night, we\u2019ve reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $5.65, or 24% year-over-year growth on $8 billion of premium revenue. Our 87.5% consolidated MCR in the second quarter demonstrates continued strong operating performance in medical cost management and was at the low end of our long-term target range. We produced a 5.3% adjusted pre-tax margin or 3.9% after tax, a very strong result that was above the high end of our long-term target range. Year-to-date, our consolidated MCR is 87.3% and our adjusted pre-tax margin is 5.4%. We note that investment income produced higher than expected results due to the increasing yield environment. In the second quarter, we continued to generate excellent margins in our Medicaid business with an MCR of 88.3%, bringing our year-to-date MCR to 88.4%. This result was in line with our full year guidance and long-term target range. As expected, the medical cost impact of redeterminations was negligible, although we are in the very early stages of that process. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 89.2%, which is above the high end of our long-term target range. We are experiencing some cost, pressure and professional and outpatient services and higher first year MCRs associated with growth. With a year-to-date Medicare MCR of 88.6%, the book of business continues to produce attractive margins. In Marketplace, our reported MCR was 73.7% for the quarter and 71.2% year-to-date. This result reflects the successful implementation of our pricing, metallic mix, and membership continuity strategies to restore this business to mid-single-digit target margins. In summary, our second quarter results built on our strong start to the year. Medicaid, our flagship business representing over 80% of revenue continues to produce strong, predictable operating results and cash flows. Our high acuity Medicare niche serving low-income members continues to grow organically and our Marketplace business is now well positioned to achieve target margins. Turning now to our 2023 guidance. Based on our strong second quarter results, we are increasing our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.50 per share to at least $20.75 or 16% growth year-over-year. Consistent with our long-term earnings per share growth target of 15% to 18%. Our earnings per share guidance is now $1 per diluted share higher than our initial guidance issued in February. Our pre-tax margins are exceeding our expectations. The Medicaid MCR is right on target, Medicare slightly behind target and marketplace substantially better. We note that these target ratios produce best in industry margins. Then of course, the interest rate environment has allowed us to produce investment income that has provided a short term earnings boost. Now, a few words on Medicaid redeterminations. During the second quarter, all but four of our states began disenrolling members with the remaining states initiating disenrollments on July 1. Our Medicaid membership declined by 93,000 members during the quarter, which was well within our expectations. Although the medical cost profile of members who have left is slightly more favorable than the portfolio average, the impact on our overall Medicaid MCR was negligible and within our expectations. We continued our outreach to members to minimize procedural disenrollment. We also continued to work with our state partners to ensure rates remain actuarially sound to account for any potential shifts in acuity. To date, all of our states have expressed a willingness to adjust rates as needed to account for any changes in acuity or trend. Mark will provide more color on redetermination during his remarks. Turning now to an update on our growth strategy. At our May Investor conference, we laid out our strategy for sustaining profitable growth. We plan to grow premiums at 13% to 15% through a combination of growth in our current footprint, strategic initiatives and accretive acquisitions. We also established a 2026 premium revenue target of $46 billion. We already have significant momentum toward achieving these growth goals. Our five recent state RFP wins drive more than $5 billion in incremental premium revenue. A portion of this incremental revenue is included in our 2023 guidance attributable to our Iowa contract, which we successfully launched July 1 with approximately 200,000 members consistent with our expectations. Most of the remainder emerges in our 2024 revenue outlook and a small component in 2025. We are also executing on the M&A component of our growth strategy consistent with our strategy of acquiring capitated government-sponsored assets. In June, we announced the acquisition of Bright HealthCare\u2019s California Medicare Business for an attractive purchase price of approximately 28% of expected 2023 premium revenue. Bright\u2019s Medicare business serves approximately 125,000 MAPD, D-SNP and C-SNP members across 23 counties in California with 60% membership overlap with Molina\u2019s Medicaid footprint. We expect the transaction to add approximately $1.8 billion of premium revenue, deliver $1 of adjusted earnings per share at full run rate, but no earnings contribution in the first full year of ownership. We expect the transaction to close by the first quarter of 2024. The closing is subject to the solvency and continued operation as a going concern of Bright Health Group throughout the pre-closing period, as well as federal and state regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. Based on known building blocks, we now have line of sight to approximately $38 billion of premium revenue in 2024 or 19% growth before executing on additional strategic initiatives. Our new store embedded earnings is now $5.50 per share, providing meaningful visibility into our future earnings growth potential. We see additional embedded earnings upside if and when the several remaining COVID era corridors are eliminated. Two short months ago at our Investor Day, we reaffirmed our long-term financial targets, the centerpiece of which is the long-term earnings per share annual growth rate of 15% to 18%. Our performance this quarter supports that outlook. The revenue base and new store earnings profile continue to build with highly accretive new contract wins and M&A. Our second quarter and year-to-date operating results provide a very solid earnings base off of which to grow, and we have seen nothing in the early stages of the Medicaid redetermination process that changes our view of the earnings trajectory of the business. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark?\nMark Keim: Thanks, Joe, and good morning everyone. Today, I will discuss some additional details of our second quarter performance, the balance sheet, some thoughts on our 2023 guidance, including an update on redeterminations and our 2024 premium revenue outlook. Beginning with our second quarter results, our consolidated MCR for the second quarter was 87.5%, reflecting continued strong medical cost management. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was 88.3%, a strong result that was in line with our expectations and long-term target range. The major medical cost categories were largely in line with our expectation and normal quarter-to-quarter trend fluctuations and COVID-related costs have largely subsided. Second quarter Medicaid membership is down 93,000 from the first quarter, largely attributable to the expected initial impact of redeterminations. In Medicare our reported MCR was 89.2%, which is above our long-term target range. During the quarter, we saw increased utilization of outpatient and professional services, as well as the continuing expected impact from strong growth in our D-SNP and MAPD products, due to the normal lag in new member margins. We make note of two key dynamics of our year-to-date Medicare performance and implications for 2024 bids. First, our MMP block of business representing half of our Medicare premium is not tied to annual Medicare bid process. And second, we were conservative in our trend assumptions in our 2024 bid process. In Marketplace, our reported MCR was 73.7%. This strong result reflects our pricing strategy to return this business to target margins prior year risk adjustment true up benefiting the quarter, as well as normal seasonal patterns for utilization. We call our pricing strategy increased our premium yield by approximately 9% this year, and with three quarters of our book in renewing members and two-thirds in silver metallic products, our risk scores should be appropriately valued. We feel well positioned to achieve our mid-single-digit target margins in this business for the year. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7.4% and includes the expected new business implementation spending, ahead of new contract wins incepting in July and next year. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. We harvested approximately $150 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, and our parent company cash balance was approximately $0.5 a billion. We expect to fund the acquisition of Bright HealthCare\u2019s Medicare business in the first quarter of 2024 with cash on hand. Debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged at just 1.6 times trailing 12 month EBITDA with our debt to cap ratio at 40%. Net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.3 times and 35% reflecting our low leverage position and ample cash and capital capacity for additional growth and investment. Turning to reserves. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and we continue to be confident in the strength of our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 47. Now some additional color on our 2023 guidance. We increased our 2023 adjusted earnings guidance by $0.50 to at least $20.75 per share. This increase is driven by second quarter operating and investment income performance above our expectations and higher expected investment income in the second half of the year, partially offset by some continued conservatism. As Joe mentioned, our current new store embedded earnings are $5.50 per share, comprised of $4 per share for our recent new contract wins in California, Iowa, Nebraska, and Indiana, plus a $1.50 [ph] per share for the acquisitions of AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin and now the recently announced acquisition of Bright Health\u2019s Medicare business, all achieving their full run rate accretion. Elimination of the remaining COVID era with corridors would provide upside to the $5.50 of new store embedded earnings. Turning to redeterminations. While the redetermination process differs from state to state and is quite complex at this early stage, we have not observed any emerging trends that would change our membership or financial outlooks. We have built robust tracking and monitoring systems to maximize retention of members that meet the eligibility criteria and to also promptly understand any financial impacts of redeterminations. Some early observations include the following, starting with membership. Our outreach protocols have been successful in helping eligible members remain in the Medicaid program. Each state has implemented an ex parte membership renewal program from state to state. We see automatic re-enrollment rates through these ex parte programs ranging from 20% to 70% of members reviewed. Data suggests and states have verified that two-thirds of those disenrolled have been procedural rather than due to verification of ineligibility. Many of these members potentially remain fully Medicaid eligible and will have a high likelihood of reconnecting to the Medicaid program. Members have 90 days to 120 days to reconnect depending on state policies. Once reconnected, Medicaid coverage and premiums reinstate retroactively to the date of disenrollment. As we interact with members who lose eligibility, we seek to warm transfer them to our Marketplace team for potential enrollment in that product. This process is in its beginning stages. Turning to early observations on the financial impact of redeterminations. Terminated members have slightly lower medical costs than the portfolio average. However, these impacts are well within our expectations and our overall MCR outlook for the year. Of course, as trends emerge, we\u2019ll be working with our state partners to ensure rates reflect any impacts of redetermination either prospectively in the normal fiscal year rate cycle, off cycle or retrospectively if necessary. We are still in the early stages of the Medicaid redetermination process. States representing half of our Medicaid revenue just began the process in June, and states representing a third of our revenue are now initiating disenrollments in July. Based on our experience to date, our current outlook on the impact of redeterminations on our business remains consistent with our previously stated expectations. Through the end of the first quarter, we estimated we had gained approximately 800,000 Medicaid members organically since the start of the pandemic. We continued to expect to retain roughly half of the members gained with no assumption for marketplace recapture. We expect the premium impact of members disenrolling to be approximately $1.6 billion and at portfolio average margins, the earnings impact could be approximately a $1 per share, split one-third in 2023 and two-thirds in 2024. Lastly, some additional color on our 2024 premium revenue outlook. As Joe mentioned, we have line of sight to the building blocks that are expected to deliver approximately $38 billion in projected revenue in 2024 or 19% growth off our 2023 premium guidance of $32 billion. These building blocks include $1.1 billion of organic growth in our current footprint, plus $4 billion from our recent state contract wins and approximately $2.3 billion of acquisition related premium, consisting of the full year of My Choice Wisconsin and the recently announced California Medicare acquisition. Partially offsetting these growth drivers is $1.4 billion for the impact of redeterminations and known pharmacy carve-outs. In summary, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance and the momentum we have established toward achieving our growth targets.  This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s first question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Appreciate all the color on the redeterminations. That\u2019s where I\u2019ll start. So could you just sort of speak to the discussions that you\u2019re having with the states? I know it\u2019s early and, four of them, you know, literally started this month, but just the conversations around rates and the impact from reverifications. You mentioned this slight mix shift that you\u2019re seeing, but could you just walk us through sort of the timing of potential rate adjustments and, how you think that plays out over time? And then is there a scenario where you can accrue higher rates based on discussions with the states, or are we going to need to see, you know, something in writing or something, formally passed at the state level before you can match, your rates to the change in acuity?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, Josh, I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll kick it to Mark for some color. First of all, the rate cycle in terms of the \u2013 our portfolio of states and how the rate cycles emerge actually couldn\u2019t be better positioned for how the redetermination process is going to unfold. 25% of our revenue has rates that renew between April and July, another 25% in the early fall and 50% on January 1, which gives us good opportunity to have great visibility into any potential impact of redeterminations and engage in those discussions with the state, which are already occurring. Now as you know, and I\u2019ll note the impact of acuity shifts is a normal rating criteria. Rating criteria includes a credible medical cost baseline, a trend off the baseline, benefit changes, plus or minus, and any potential acuity shift. So the fact that there\u2019s an acuity shift that\u2019s speculated to occur is actually part of the dialogue we\u2019re already having in the states. Now only a handful of states actually implemented rates between April and July. And I\u2019ll hand it over to Mark and he can give you some color on how those discussions went.\nMark Keim: Hey, good morning Josh, so in July, we had five states representing about 10% of our revenue move into a new pricing cycle. About half of those states led with a proactive concession for what\u2019s going on with redetermination. The other half said, gee [ph], we have no data yet. But as data develops, we will either retro or mid-cycle make an adjustment. I think the overarching theme here, it is still so early, even here in late July to be looking at data-driven conclusions on redetermination. So all states have made the commitment that rates will be actuarially sound. And just about all states have said that mid-cycle, they\u2019ll make a mid-cycle adjustment or a retro adjustment to do a catch up if needed. And of course, we\u2019re in there talking with states that on normal rate cycles, we\u2019re getting things proactively where we need it. The other part of your question, our accounting policies require that we have specific documentation on rates \u2013 so we\u2019ll book them as they actually get confirmed by the states.\nJosh Raskin: Okay. So bottom line half are reflecting this already in some sort of perspective, we see it coming and the other half are going to make you whole at some point?\nMark Keim: Of the states in July, that is correct. \nJosh Raskin: Yes. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Justin Lake at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. \nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of questions on numbers. First, on the exchanges, can you tell us what the potential benefit was or what the actual benefit was to second quarter in terms of the 2022 final risk adjustment true-up. And then you said there that you\u2019re confident in mid-single-digit target margins your MLR looks to me like it\u2019s down 10% plus in the first and second quarter. Last year was flat. So it looks like you\u2019re on target to do well better than 5%. And am I missing something there? Or is the back half going to be kind of flat year-over-year on an MLR basis?\nJoe Zubretsky: Justin, it\u2019s Joe, I\u2019ll kick it to Mark for some color. The marketplace business, our strategy of keep it small, silver and stable, plus starring in a 9% price increase for the year clearly has us on track for mid-single-digit margins. In fact, our guidance contemplates about just over 6% pretax margin for the full year. Now to your question, while you\u2019re at 71.2% for the first half, that must mean you\u2019re at 85% for the second half. Two factors. One, we\u2019re taking on special enrollment period membership as the year goes on. So as the year progresses, more \u2013 higher mix of your membership is special enrollment membership, which carries a higher initial MLR and second, a greater proportion of our book is in higher deductible products, which makes the seasonality toward the back half more dramatic than it has been in the past. 71% first half, 85% second half, 78% for the year. Mark, do you want to talk about the drop?\nMark Keim: Sure. I saw some analysts right on this topic. And some of them, we\u2019re throwing around some pretty big numbers as much as $66 million in positive development of December 31. Just on risk adjustment. And what those analysts miss is that about half of that benefit a little more is tied up in margins. For those of you that follow the accounting, when we hang up an actuarial liability for risk adjustment, we try to identify the liability, but we also book a margin associated with it in case we\u2019re wrong.  More to the point, we also book a margin for risk adjustment data validation or RADV. So that $66 potential benefit that folks were looking at is roughly cut in half, a little bit more than cut in half just by the retention of margins that don\u2019t fall to the bottom line. So then you\u2019re working with a little bit less than half of that. The other thing is, as these risk adjustment liabilities ultimately emerge, most of you are aware that a service called Wakeley [ph], which anonymously combines the inputs from everybody so that we can all get some insights as we move along. As a result, quarter-to-quarter, we\u2019re accruing and getting pretty dialed in on the ultimate liability. So this big number we\u2019re potentially talking about more than cut and half, and largely recognized in first quarter with a little bit in the second quarter. The only other thing I\u2019d say on the topic is this is normal development of risk adjustment kind of like IBNR, you always book it, but you expect it to roll off slightly favorable. So I wouldn\u2019t call this necessarily an anomaly, but it is spread between the first and second quarter, and it\u2019s in our numbers.\nJoe Zubretsky: And Justin, the last thing I would say on the topic, the return to mid-single-digit margins is really a result of that disciplined strategy that has worked and was executed perfectly for the year, 6% pretax for the full year not because of accounting adjustments, but because of the pricing discipline and the positioning of the book. Thank you.\nJustin Lake: That\u2019s great detail. Thanks. I\u2019ll \u2013 can I squeeze in one on investment income, Joe? What\u2019s the expectation for the full year? And then you said some of this is temporary. What should we think about normal investment income as we take out to 2026?\nJoe Zubretsky: Well, the way we look at it, first of all, your pick on the yield curve would determine for the most part, what that would look like. But what we try to remind folks is that of our $8 billion portfolio, half is in intermediate term securities where we won\u2019t be immediately responsible to interest rate changes and the other half is in cash, which will be immediately responsible to interest rate changes. That\u2019s the first fact. And make your yield curve pick for the rest of the year. We certainly are forecasting lower interest rates for the back half of the year on our cash balance, which also will be reduced between mid-year and end of the year due to the payment of some significant government payables that we need to get paid. Mark, any more color?\nMark Keim: Joe\u2019s got it right. Half of the portfolio is in cash, we made close to 5% on that cash in the second quarter. Now if anybody\u2019s guess what the Fed does here. But our balance sheet is obviously very responsive to changes in Fed short-term rates. So 5% of that cash in the second quarter, but it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess where these rates go third and fourth quarter. And as Joe mentioned, I\u2019m also forecasting a slight decline in cash balance as we pay out some payables and some other true-ups on our balance sheet. \nJustin Lake: Thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Stephen Baxter of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nStephen Baxter: Yes. Hey, I appreciate all the color on redeterminations and the procedural terminations that we\u2019re seeing out there. I guess I wanted to ask on the ex parte reviews and the success getting some members reenrolled. I\u2019d love to get a sense of what percentage of members getting terminated for procedural reasons are actually getting these ex parte reviews? Is it all members that are terminated for those reasons or some kind of subset, and then is your expectation that going forward, more of these reviews will be happening ahead of disenrollment \u2013 my understanding was that\u2019s generally how it\u2019s supposed to work. So I\u2019m surprised there\u2019s so much focus on it now occurring on the back end? Thank you.\nJoe Zubretsky: Let me just reframe the numbers, and I\u2019ll keep it to more. Our states have all have executed ex parte processes. The automatic renewal rates have ranged from 20% to 70%, which is actually quite high. On terminations, at least two-thirds of the terminations have been procedural, in some cases, up to 75%, which then means \u2013 and this is the important point on the procedural terminations. The number of reconnects of the members that will reconnect to the process within the 90- to 120-day grace period is actually expected to be quite high since the procedural termination rate was also quite high. Now we haven\u2019t seen that yet. Because this process just started. But we believe throughout the third quarter into the fourth, we\u2019re going to see significant reconnection activity, which will carry with it retroactive premium back to the initial data disenrollment. Mark, some color on the detail numbers?\nMark Keim: Absolutely. So, ex parte, 20% to 70% of folks reviewed, just to be clear, that\u2019s in advance of any loss of membership. It\u2019s obviously a way to avoid folks losing their eligibility. There\u2019s a few resources out there that have published views on this 40% of members when they go through eligibility verification, are losing their eligibility. 60% are retaining eligibility. It\u2019s estimated that 50% of the 60% that retain get it through ex parte. So it\u2019s obviously very powerful, and CMS is encouraging states to step it up and do more ex parte.  Finally, as Joe mentioned, with two-thirds of the folks losing eligibility due to procedural reasons, this reconnects is really important. States are giving between 90 and 120 days for folks that lose eligibility to become aware of it, refile and get back on rolls. And if they do it within 90 to 120 days, their eligibility goes retro to the day they lost it. So we cover any claims in the interim, but also the premium for us goes retro back to the day they lost their eligibility. So very powerful on these reconnects. It\u2019s too early here in July for us to really see good data on reconnects. Most of our markets started in June, which means reconnects will just start coming in the next month or two, but a really powerful part of these enrollments.\nStephen Baxter: Thanks. And just one quick follow-up, if I can. You mentioned the medical cost profile on the early disenrollment slightly favorable. I guess at this stage, how are you thinking about what that could look like for the reconnects. Thank you. \nJoe Zubretsky: Didn\u2019t get the last part of your question. But yes, on the members that are disenrolling the medical loss ratio is slightly more favorable than the portfolio average as expected. All contemplated within the 88.5% medical care ratio that we projected for the Medicaid business for the full year. We have seen nothing that suggests that we will not be able to hit that. And bear in mind, as we mentioned many other times, we also have, in many of our states, either a corridor or a minimum MLR, that carries with it a rather significant liability that we\u2019ve already recorded. Any medical cost inflection that happens in the back half of the year would be first absorbed by any corridor or minimum MLR liability before impacting our earnings. Mark?\nMark Keim: Yes. Just to add to that, levers are slightly lower on MLR. We\u2019re expecting a lot of reconnects. How will reconnects come back on MLR? Well, there\u2019s a theory out there that reconnects many of them will only become aware of their need to reconnect because they have another claim or another doc visit, which means when they\u2019re coming back on, they may come with a claim but they were also likely to come with two to three months of premium revenue. So I\u2019m expecting pretty much a reversion to our mean as we see these reconnects and not a lot of volatility there.\nStephen Baxter: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. \nA.J. Rice: Hi everybody. Maybe just quickly, a couple of other aspects on the reverification process. I wonder you can see the states are publishing about how many members are getting disenrolled and how much of process disenrollments, I know you\u2019ve got a lot of outreach efforts. Is your own experience at this point different than the aggregate numbers we\u2019re seeing states? Are you able to engage more effectively? And I\u2019d also wonder I know these people engage with the health system, clinics, ERs and hospitals, pharmacies, et cetera. Do you have any data on how often a member engages with one of those locations that might end up being a catalyst to get renewed proactively?\nJoe Zubretsky: Well, I think on the first part of your question, first of all, state mix is really important. As we said in our prepared remarks, some states moved very aggressively initially, some states more cautiously. Some states, even \u2013 three of our states pause to let the administrative processes catch up with the flow of work. So I think state mix is really, really important as you judge any one company or any one state against sort of the market average. But we have seen nothing in the process that is outside of our expectations as we said. In terms of experience, we believe that a member will be reminded that they need to be on Medicaid if and when they have to go to the doctor or the emergency room or for some procedure. And as Mark said, maybe they\u2019ll come back with a claim, but they\u2019ll also come back with three or four months of retro premium. And that means the reversion to the mean to the portfolio average MCR is supported by that thesis.\nMark Keim: A.J., the only other thing I\u2019d add is so many of our members are associated with family members and the incidence of one family member over the first couple of months needing medical care of some kind is high, which means the whole family gets renewed. So that\u2019s really a helpful fact as we think about these reconnects.\nA.J. Rice: Okay. And maybe just one follow-up on the \u2013 in your comments about the Bright Health acquisition. You mentioned that one; you\u2019ve got a solvency contingency in there. Is that related to the California plan you\u2019re buying? Or is that related to all of Bright Health and would there be any opportunity if there is any issues for you to support the California plan as you\u2019re waiting to get the regulatory approvals. \nJoe Zubretsky: No, that comment did not relate to the properties that we acquired \u2013 the properties we acquired will carry with it the amount of regulatory capital needed to run the plan. They are underperforming on margin, but really good line of sight to membership and revenue. That comment was really to state that the ongoing, going concern in the financial solvency of the parent company would obviously be critical to their ability to close the transaction. That\u2019s all that referred to. The properties have intact revenue and will be delivered with the required amount of capital.\nA.J. Rice: Okay, thanks a lot. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Calvin Sternick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nCalvin Sternick: Yes. Thanks for the question. I know it\u2019s pretty early on the marketplace side of things, but just curious what kind of sort of trends you\u2019re seeing in terms of applications or enrollment in June and July that you can speak to? And then maybe just one follow-up on the Bright business, $1 per share of embedded earnings, no contribution next year, but can you give a sense for what sort of the time line is to reaching run rate on that business?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure. I\u2019ll comment on the Bright acquisition first, and then we\u2019ll comment about the marketplace. This is the first Medicare acquisition we\u2019ve done. And Medicare, as works on an annual cycle for star ratings, for risk adjustment for rates, et cetera. The business had its own profit improvement plan in place. So the answer to your question is unknown at the time. How much profit improvement will that business have during the period time to close, we don\u2019t know. We are still confident that whatever is delivered to us at the time of closing, we will be able to get that to our target margins by the end of the second year. So when we said no earnings contribution early because we don\u2019t know exactly what the financial status, the margin status of the plan that will be delivered to us will be at the time of closing. So breakeven initially a minimum, and then we\u2019ll build a target margin in a two year period, and we\u2019re very confident in the $1 estimate that we\u2019ve given you.\nMark Keim: On the marketplace question, you\u2019ll appreciate with special enrollment period, we\u2019re constantly picking up members month-to-month. That\u2019s a pretty routine phenomenon here. What will be different going forward is we\u2019ll start to pick up people that came off the Medicaid roles. Now we\u2019ve got good visibility in special enrollment period, month-to-month, who\u2019s coming in from Medicaid. Who\u2019s coming in from our Medicaid plans, who\u2019s coming in from other Medicaid plans, those numbers are still quite de minimis. Within our special enrollment period gains. But I would expect them to pick up dramatically in the months ahead. Remember, June is still the first month that most folks came off. So July, August, September, I would expect to see the marketplace numbers start to creep up. And we\u2019re able to track those who\u2019s coming from Medicaid and what plans.\nJoe Zubretsky: And just as a reminder, our membership forecast do not include the retention of Medicaid membership losses into our marketplace product. We didn\u2019t have a good estimate of what that would look like. We still don\u2019t \u2013 that would be upside to our membership projection.\nCalvin Sternick: Great. Thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead. \nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Actually just wanted to stick on the marketplace topic. And just interested in some of your early thoughts around positioning for 2024, given that if you\u2019re going to be back at target margins here this year, I know that you\u2019re very sensitive to managing the exposure on this business given how volatile it\u2019s been on the margin side, but it definitely looks like there\u2019s a pretty hardening pricing environment for individual and small group occurring \u2013 for 2024. And then if there is continued opportunity on the Catcher\u2019s Mitt side for [indiscernible] in 2024 as well. So really just sort of thinking about where your sort of philosophy is right now on that growth versus margin question for the exchanges in 2024. \nJoe Zubretsky: So Scott, our position on margin versus growth for Marketplace has not changed. We will position the business to earn mid-single-digit target margins and then allow it to grow at whatever rate can produce those margins, small, silver and stable. Now we\u2019ve just put out a revenue estimate for next year an outlook of $38 billion or 19% growth year-over-year, which includes only a modest amount, a moderate amount of projected growth in Marketplace. So we do plan to allocate more capital to Marketplace next year, but the growth we anticipate by the prices we filed will be measured and moderate. We actually don\u2019t need to allocate more capital to Marketplace in order to produce high-teens growth rates in the business, 19% premium growth year-over-year with only modest and moderate growth in Marketplace since Medicaid is doing so well.\nScott Fidel: Okay. Got it. And then just for the follow-up. Interested if you could maybe just walk us through what\u2019s now factored into guidance for Medicare MLR for the back half of the year? And then just, I guess, obviously, you\u2019re not giving 2024 guidance here, but some early thoughts on some suggestions on how we should think about Medicare MLR sort of modeling for 2024. Obviously, it\u2019s a bit elevated this year and looking out to a pretty challenging rate environment next year and then you\u2019ve got the Bright asset coming online as well at breakeven. So just sort of your thinking here on sort of Medicare MLR, I guess, sort of trajectory in the back half and it\u2019s 2024. Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure. For 2024, first of all, we are \u2013 we believe we were conservative in our trend estimates that we included in our Medicare bids for 2024. Second point is, recall, only about half our business actually relies on the Medicare bidding process. The other half is the MMP business, where we get rates that are not tied to that process. When it comes to star ratings and risk adjustment and all those other features and factors, again, the fact that we\u2019re in the half of the business is MNP is helpful to that process. And when it comes to stars, we have plenty of value-added benefits, the actuarial value of value-added benefits is significant as it is with competitors. So we believe that we can maintain margins by pulling back some of the ancillary benefits still have a very competitively priced product and a very competitively positioned product from a benefit perspective to continue to grow the business.\nMark Keim: And just to build on that, I feel good that we had a reasonable line of sight into Q2 as we put in our pricing for next year. Scott, just on your question on the rest of 2023, we\u2019re conservative guys within our guidance is mid-to-low 88 [ph] for the rest of the year, and that\u2019s within the guidance we\u2019ve given.\nScott Fidel: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\nSarah James: Thank you. Some of the states have filed waivers that allow you to be a little bit more hands on in communicating updated contact information. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re noticing any difference in those states with the procedural and unable to contact terminations. And then in the states that didn\u2019t file the waivers like Florida, when [indiscernible] opened the door for more collaboration between health plans and states on that. Did that make a difference in your discussions with Florida around how to reach out correctly to eligible?\nJoe Zubretsky: Well, Sarah, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to comment on any particular state, but we \u2013 our protocols that we started building a year ago on member outreach and every state was different. Some states allowed significant involvement from MCOs, some states less so. Some states allow you to actually help the member reestablish eligibility by filling out forms. Some states didn\u2019t. Now as you know, CMS has stepped in and sort of suggested through policy statements that states should allow MCOs to be more involved in the reverification process. So I assure you that we are locked in to every single state in which we do business with the state regulatory authorities and are working hand in glove with them to make sure that everybody that should be on Medicaid is and people that shouldn\u2019t be thrown off Medicaid aren\u2019t. State by state. And yes, it has had an impact on our outreach efforts and gives us really good line of sight and good visibility into the fact that if a member should be on Medicaid, we\u2019re pretty confident between the state\u2019s efforts and our efforts that we\u2019ll be able to keep them in the system.\nSarah James: Great. And then just to follow up on Scott\u2019s question around the Medicare bids. If I think about in context of the book that you\u2019re acquiring from Bright, and your guidance of breakeven in year one, are you assuming that if there is any industry-wide utilization inflation on Medicare that, that was captured in their 2024 bid?\nJoe Zubretsky: Without getting into specifics, I will answer the question this way. Our due diligence process through a clean room process allowed us visibility into their bid through an independent third party. And we are confident that the transparency that was provided in that process gives us confidence that the bid was rational, included all trend factors that should be included in a bid. And as I said, their profit improvement plan is going to be the key factor. How much of that profit improvement did they actually achieve between sign and close in terms of what we inherit is actually going to determine whether \u2013 what the bet earnings picture looks like at the point of closing.\nSarah James: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Michael Ha with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ha: Thank you. Just quickly, first on redetermination, Mark, I know you mentioned the state made proactive concessions and rates for redeterminations in July. Just wanted to clarify, were those rate adjustments ready embedded in your current 2023 guidance? Or does that represent upside to your guide and are you able to provide a sense on magnitude of those rate concessions?\nMark Keim: Well, a couple of things. Those couple of states that we already had rate concessions in the July 1 race. A very small part of our revenue and also done somewhat academically as the data hadn\u2019t developed in those states quite yet. All of that is incorporated in the guidance I\u2019ve given you. But again, such a small component. I think I mentioned five states started their new fiscal year, July 1, representing just 10% of revenue, and the states that gave those concessions were a subset within that. So not really a big deal, but in guidance.\nMichael Ha: Got it. Thank you. And just to dive deeper into MA MLR, curious, what specific type of outpatient utilization driving the pressure this quarter? Was it pent-up demand, hips, knees, could you walk us through the progression of the utilization year-to-date? Like how much of it might have been 1Q versus 2Q? And on the \u2013 I think there\u2019s about $27 million of unfavorable PPD in the quarter. Curious if you could help us break it out between MA commercial Medicaid. Thank you.\nJoe Zubretsky: I\u2019ll keep the PPD question to Mark, but on the Medicare MLR, it was outpatient, mostly ambulatory surgeries. Our population really doesn\u2019t have a lot of the hips, knees and joints that you\u2019d see in a more standard Medicare advance population. But we\u2019re also seeing PCP visits and the typical routine preventive screenings come back. I won\u2019t call it pent-up demand, but returning to normal, the types of services that Medicare patients and members normally get. Ambulatory surgeries, PCP visits, preventive screenings and care, a little bit of drug usage, but not a lot. And keep in mind, we\u2019re only operating \u2013 I need to \u2013 I\u2019m not rationalized again, 120 basis points above the top end of our range. The Medicare book is well positioned to earn a 4.5% pretax margin this year. So we\u2019re in good shape there. Mark, do you want to talk about the PPD?\nMark Keim: Yep. Michael, what\u2019s your question about the prior year development?\nMichael Ha: Yes.\nMark Keim: Yes. So\u2026\nMichael Ha: About $27 million.\nMark Keim: You got it exactly right. So in general, overall development was favorable. We take great confidence in quarter-after-quarter, our development is favorable. The prior year portion, as you point out, negative by a small amount. Typically, we would expect that to develop positively. But whenever there\u2019s a particular provider contracts settlement or something going on, it can create some noise. But in particular, what happened to this quarter was there\u2019s something some of you may be familiar with California SB 510, which was a specific court ruling that held health plans liable for certain COVID expenses. We\u2019ve recognized that charge as did some of our other competitors this quarter, and that created a little bit of the noise you\u2019re seeing.\nMichael Ha: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning. So I guess, given your comments earlier on the call to address all the investor debate as to whether or not the Medicaid MLR could be adversely impacted by just lower utilization members coming off the rolls during redeterminations and thus risk of higher Medicaid MLR on the remaining Medicaid members. Really just the conclusion around all that is what is your level of concern around this higher Medicaid MLR risk at this point, if any? Can be now put this to bed from your perspective. And also, if you could remind us, is there any preliminary buy as you can point to for your 2024 Medicaid MLR to be either better, in line or worse versus what you guided for Medicaid MLR for 2023? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Well, Steven, since we haven\u2019t changed our outlook for the redetermination process, 800,000 members up, 400,000 down, $1.6 billion in premium, one third this year, two thirds next and an 88.5% Medicaid MCR for the year. Since we haven\u2019t changed all our acuity determination and we\u2019re holding firm on our Medicaid outlook \u2013 Medicaid MLR outlook for the year \u2013 that\u2019s all been contemplated. So we\u2019re in good shape there. We see nothing that causes us to change that point of view. The fact that the MCRs of levers is slightly more favorable than the portfolio average is not a surprise, and it\u2019s maybe not as dramatic as one might think. The other point to make and bear in mind, and we don\u2019t disclose year-by-year how much of this we have. But most of our states have some form of either minimum MLR or some type of corridor program that we are well into because we operate very efficiently, we historically have paid into these mechanisms. Any intra-year impact from on medical margin, whether it\u2019s trend or whether it\u2019s yield, would be first absorbed by the significant liabilities we have already recorded for these conventions. That gives us great confidence that the 88.5% is a very good estimate for the year, all contemplated within the $20.75 guide for the year. Mark, do you want to talk about maybe some of the bridging items in the next year?\nMark Keim: Yes, into next year, specifically around Medicaid MLRs \u2013 it will be partly a function of these pricings and rate cycles that we\u2019re having, most of which are in front of us. 50% of our revenue comes up for our January 1 fiscal year. That \u2013 those pricing discussions, obviously, actuarial policies require that states recognize anything that goes on with redetermination. And then finally, as Joe mentioned, even into next year, those continuing corridors and minimum MLRs continue to give us great comfort on our projected margins. So not looking at a lot of volatility into next year.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Kevin Fischbeck at Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. I want to go back to a question a couple of times, I\u2019m not sure if you answered it. Is there a way to quantify how much the states who have built in something for rates are putting in? Is it something like 20 basis points? Is it 200 basis points? Like how should we think about how the states are thinking about the types of rates that need to be adjusted to reflect redeterminations.\nMark Keim: Yes. Thanks for the question, Kevin. I\u2019m hesitant to give specific numbers because it differs state to state. But the real reason I\u2019m hesitant to give the numbers is two things. One, for the most part, they were done academically, not on data they were done prospectively academically, so means they were guessing no better than all the rest of us were three months ago. So academic prospective. But the bigger point is you might get a specific concession for redetermination. But in the presence of seven or eight adjustments up and down for other reasons, it gets lost co-mingled into the grand scheme of things. We have to come back to the overall concept of actuarial soundness. And if those rates develop in a place that just aren\u2019t appropriate, we\u2019ll be back with our states to make sure that they are.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay. That makes sense. And then I guess maybe just on trend, generally speaking, \u2013 it seems like a lot of companies are talking about MA trend being higher, but not seeing it in commercial or Medicaid. Is there a reason why you look at this and say, that makes sense why it\u2019s not broader, like MA has been below trend, but I guess Medicaid has kind of been below trend, too. So why do you think that we\u2019re seeing an above-average return on Medicare Advantage, but not within Medicaid?\nJoe Zubretsky: It\u2019s really hard to say. First of all, our Medicare book, the profile of it is vastly different than many of the other books of business. This is not mainstream MAPD. This is high acuity, D-SNP and the demonstrations, which are the fully integrated Medicare and Medicaid product. So the population is vastly different. Look, our trends in the quarter were very simple to understand, 3% in Medicaid, 6% in Medicare, 7.5% in Marketplace. All well within expectations. And I would just say that the mix of the book of business and the profile of the book of business better said, is probably reasons for some of the differential as competitors report their results.\nKevin Fischbeck: I guess when you think about it within your own book of business, if Medicaid is come in well during COVID and Medicare came in well during COVID and now Medicare snapping back of Medicaid is not is there a reason why by case, not snapping back?\nJoe Zubretsky: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any discernible answer to that. The 81% of our book of business is Medicaid. The trend is behaving exactly within our expectations. And why one is behaving slightly hotter or more warm than the other, it\u2019s hard to tell.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Nathan Rich at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Great. Good morning, and thank you for the question. Just as it relates to the exchange opportunity from members that go through the redetermination process. It sounds like you haven\u2019t seen much, if anything, on that front yet. But I guess in the outreach you\u2019re doing with members, \u2013 have you had any kind of early success with potentially directing those members to a Marketplace plan who might not be eligible for Medicaid.\nJoe Zubretsky: Well, the process \u2013 again, it\u2019s early. The process is in full gear. We have robust distribution channels internally, call center employees or licensed agents who know how to do this, and the warm transfer process is enacted and in process. All we\u2019re saying is because it\u2019s so early, we have not seen a huge uptick in the number of marketplace members we\u2019re getting out of Medicaid. We track what we obtain in marketplace out of our own Medicaid plans, but we also track what we get in the marketplace from other Medicaid plans. And because it\u2019s drilling the process, all we\u2019re saying is that monthly figure has not increased dramatically, but we expect it will as this process gets more traction.\nMark Keim: I think that\u2019s right to build on that. Remember, two-thirds of these folks that are coming off are procedural, which means they don\u2019t even know that they\u2019re losing coverage. When they do, they\u2019ll either come back on to Medicaid or what a great chance to get them on the Marketplace.\nNathan Rich: Great. And then some state Medicaid programs, I think, are looking at covering the GLP-1 drugs for obesity. I guess, have you had any conversations with states with respect to that? And what factors they might be considering and how that could be worked into state programs just as we think about what potential impact could be?\nJoe Zubretsky: Yes. Right now, I think the way to look at it is Medicare doesn\u2019t pay for off-label uses. And when it comes to the individual states, some do allow it for weight control and many don\u2019t. But as they contemplate it, it\u2019s a rate discussion. My view is there\u2019s no medical cost that is inappropriate. If there\u2019s a medical cost or a benefit that\u2019s included in the program as long as it\u2019s rated for that\u2019s fine. So the trend in these prescriptions is well known and well documented. Some states already included in their formularies, others don\u2019t. And when that conversation comes up, then it\u2019s a conversation between actuaries in terms of the pharmacy component of the rate and whether it covers the $12,000 a year that it\u2019s going to cost to dispense one of these prescriptions.\nNathan Rich: Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, our final question today comes from George Hill at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Hey good morning guys and thanks for sneaking me in. I know it\u2019s a small part of the business. But I guess is there a way to big picture think about like the magnitude of the change in the value of the benefit in MA for 2024 as you guys try to balance the kind of the challenging rate environment with the changes to the risk model with kind of the need to preserve the margin profile of the business or preserve the margin profile of the business. Everybody kind of talks about the kind of the like the drawing down on benefit bout just trying to get a sense of magnitude, if there\u2019s a way to quantify that or kind of talk about it directionally.\nJoe Zubretsky: George, we couldn\u2019t hear the first part of your question. Are you talking about Medicare Advantage?\nGeorge Hill: Yes, I was. And just like with the challenging rate environment, everybody is talking about kind of like the raining and it benefits a little bit. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a way to quantify that a little bit or kind of speak to it directionally kind of the magnitude of the change of benefit.\nJoe Zubretsky: Yes. No, I understand. We\u2019re not going to begin to publish sort of the percentage of actuarial value of the product that\u2019s represented by ancillary benefits. But it\u2019s significant. Our products are very competitive. With all the types of benefits, vision, dental, those cash card benefits, travel benefits, gym memberships, all those things are included in the product. And our competitive intelligence and analysis suggests that we can have a zero premium product with competitive benefits if and when our star ratings aren\u2019t necessarily benchmarked with the rest of the market. We\u2019re not going to size that, but we\u2019re pretty confident that we can pull in benefits marginally, still have a very, very robust product in respect to ancillary benefits and still be competitive.\nMark Keim: The only other thing I\u2019d add, George, is when we think about benefit design, there are a number of items which for a competitive shopper are must-have. And there\u2019s a bunch of other things, which are part of the benefit load that are nice to have but don\u2019t necessarily influence the buying decision. You can imagine how we\u2019re thinking about changing benefit design. But we and our decisions probably won\u2019t be much different than the broader markets. So I\u2019m expecting a pretty even competitive dynamic next year.\nGeorge Hill: That\u2019s great color. Thanks guys.\nJoe Zubretsky: And with no other calls, that concludes our call today. Thank you, everyone.",

            "name": "Mark Keim",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and good morning everyone. Today, I will discuss some additional details of our second quarter performance, the balance sheet, some thoughts on our 2023 guidance, including an update on redeterminations and our 2024 premium revenue outlook. Beginning with our second quarter results, our consolidated MCR for the second quarter was 87.5%, reflecting continued strong medical cost management. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was 88.3%, a strong result that was in line with our expectations and long-term target range. The major medical cost categories were largely in line with our expectation and normal quarter-to-quarter trend fluctuations and COVID-related costs have largely subsided. Second quarter Medicaid membership is down 93,000 from the first quarter, largely attributable to the expected initial impact of redeterminations. In Medicare our reported MCR was 89.2%, which is above our long-term target range. During the quarter, we saw increased utilization of outpatient and professional services, as well as the continuing expected impact from strong growth in our D-SNP and MAPD products, due to the normal lag in new member margins. We make note of two key dynamics of our year-to-date Medicare performance and implications for 2024 bids. First, our MMP block of business representing half of our Medicare premium is not tied to annual Medicare bid process. And second, we were conservative in our trend assumptions in our 2024 bid process. In Marketplace, our reported MCR was 73.7%. This strong result reflects our pricing strategy to return this business to target margins prior year risk adjustment true up benefiting the quarter, as well as normal seasonal patterns for utilization. We call our pricing strategy increased our premium yield by approximately 9% this year, and with three quarters of our book in renewing members and two-thirds in silver metallic products, our risk scores should be appropriately valued. We feel well positioned to achieve our mid-single-digit target margins in this business for the year. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7.4% and includes the expected new business implementation spending, ahead of new contract wins incepting in July and next year. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. We harvested approximately $150 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, and our parent company cash balance was approximately $0.5 a billion. We expect to fund the acquisition of Bright HealthCare's Medicare business in the first quarter of 2024 with cash on hand. Debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged at just 1.6 times trailing 12 month EBITDA with our debt to cap ratio at 40%. Net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.3 times and 35% reflecting our low leverage position and ample cash and capital capacity for additional growth and investment. Turning to reserves. Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters and we continue to be confident in the strength of our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 47. Now some additional color on our 2023 guidance. We increased our 2023 adjusted earnings guidance by $0.50 to at least $20.75 per share. This increase is driven by second quarter operating and investment income performance above our expectations and higher expected investment income in the second half of the year, partially offset by some continued conservatism. As Joe mentioned, our current new store embedded earnings are $5.50 per share, comprised of $4 per share for our recent new contract wins in California, Iowa, Nebraska, and Indiana, plus a $1.50 [ph] per share for the acquisitions of AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin and now the recently announced acquisition of Bright Health's Medicare business, all achieving their full run rate accretion. Elimination of the remaining COVID era with corridors would provide upside to the $5.50 of new store embedded earnings. Turning to redeterminations. While the redetermination process differs from state to state and is quite complex at this early stage, we have not observed any emerging trends that would change our membership or financial outlooks. We have built robust tracking and monitoring systems to maximize retention of members that meet the eligibility criteria and to also promptly understand any financial impacts of redeterminations. Some early observations include the following, starting with membership. Our outreach protocols have been successful in helping eligible members remain in the Medicaid program. Each state has implemented an ex parte membership renewal program from state to state. We see automatic re-enrollment rates through these ex parte programs ranging from 20% to 70% of members reviewed. Data suggests and states have verified that two-thirds of those disenrolled have been procedural rather than due to verification of ineligibility. Many of these members potentially remain fully Medicaid eligible and will have a high likelihood of reconnecting to the Medicaid program. Members have 90 days to 120 days to reconnect depending on state policies. Once reconnected, Medicaid coverage and premiums reinstate retroactively to the date of disenrollment. As we interact with members who lose eligibility, we seek to warm transfer them to our Marketplace team for potential enrollment in that product. This process is in its beginning stages. Turning to early observations on the financial impact of redeterminations. Terminated members have slightly lower medical costs than the portfolio average. However, these impacts are well within our expectations and our overall MCR outlook for the year. Of course, as trends emerge, we'll be working with our state partners to ensure rates reflect any impacts of redetermination either prospectively in the normal fiscal year rate cycle, off cycle or retrospectively if necessary. We are still in the early stages of the Medicaid redetermination process. States representing half of our Medicaid revenue just began the process in June, and states representing a third of our revenue are now initiating disenrollments in July. Based on our experience to date, our current outlook on the impact of redeterminations on our business remains consistent with our previously stated expectations. Through the end of the first quarter, we estimated we had gained approximately 800,000 Medicaid members organically since the start of the pandemic. We continued to expect to retain roughly half of the members gained with no assumption for marketplace recapture. We expect the premium impact of members disenrolling to be approximately $1.6 billion and at portfolio average margins, the earnings impact could be approximately a $1 per share, split one-third in 2023 and two-thirds in 2024. Lastly, some additional color on our 2024 premium revenue outlook. As Joe mentioned, we have line of sight to the building blocks that are expected to deliver approximately $38 billion in projected revenue in 2024 or 19% growth off our 2023 premium guidance of $32 billion. These building blocks include $1.1 billion of organic growth in our current footprint, plus $4 billion from our recent state contract wins and approximately $2.3 billion of acquisition related premium, consisting of the full year of My Choice Wisconsin and the recently announced California Medicare acquisition. Partially offsetting these growth drivers is $1.4 billion for the impact of redeterminations and known pharmacy carve-outs. In summary, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance and the momentum we have established toward achieving our growth targets.  This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Hey, good morning Josh, so in July, we had five states representing about 10% of our revenue move into a new pricing cycle. About half of those states led with a proactive concession for what's going on with redetermination. The other half said, gee [ph], we have no data yet. But as data develops, we will either retro or mid-cycle make an adjustment. I think the overarching theme here, it is still so early, even here in late July to be looking at data-driven conclusions on redetermination. So all states have made the commitment that rates will be actuarially sound. And just about all states have said that mid-cycle, they'll make a mid-cycle adjustment or a retro adjustment to do a catch up if needed. And of course, we're in there talking with states that on normal rate cycles, we're getting things proactively where we need it. The other part of your question, our accounting policies require that we have specific documentation on rates \u2013 so we'll book them as they actually get confirmed by the states. Of the states in July, that is correct. Sure. I saw some analysts right on this topic. And some of them, we're throwing around some pretty big numbers as much as $66 million in positive development of December 31. Just on risk adjustment. And what those analysts miss is that about half of that benefit a little more is tied up in margins. For those of you that follow the accounting, when we hang up an actuarial liability for risk adjustment, we try to identify the liability, but we also book a margin associated with it in case we're wrong.  More to the point, we also book a margin for risk adjustment data validation or RADV. So that $66 potential benefit that folks were looking at is roughly cut in half, a little bit more than cut in half just by the retention of margins that don't fall to the bottom line. So then you're working with a little bit less than half of that. The other thing is, as these risk adjustment liabilities ultimately emerge, most of you are aware that a service called Wakeley [ph], which anonymously combines the inputs from everybody so that we can all get some insights as we move along. As a result, quarter-to-quarter, we're accruing and getting pretty dialed in on the ultimate liability. So this big number we're potentially talking about more than cut and half, and largely recognized in first quarter with a little bit in the second quarter. The only other thing I'd say on the topic is this is normal development of risk adjustment kind of like IBNR, you always book it, but you expect it to roll off slightly favorable. So I wouldn't call this necessarily an anomaly, but it is spread between the first and second quarter, and it's in our numbers. Joe's got it right. Half of the portfolio is in cash, we made close to 5% on that cash in the second quarter. Now if anybody's guess what the Fed does here. But our balance sheet is obviously very responsive to changes in Fed short-term rates. So 5% of that cash in the second quarter, but it's anybody's guess where these rates go third and fourth quarter. And as Joe mentioned, I'm also forecasting a slight decline in cash balance as we pay out some payables and some other true-ups on our balance sheet. Absolutely. So, ex parte, 20% to 70% of folks reviewed, just to be clear, that's in advance of any loss of membership. It's obviously a way to avoid folks losing their eligibility. There's a few resources out there that have published views on this 40% of members when they go through eligibility verification, are losing their eligibility. 60% are retaining eligibility. It's estimated that 50% of the 60% that retain get it through ex parte. So it's obviously very powerful, and CMS is encouraging states to step it up and do more ex parte.  Finally, as Joe mentioned, with two-thirds of the folks losing eligibility due to procedural reasons, this reconnects is really important. States are giving between 90 and 120 days for folks that lose eligibility to become aware of it, refile and get back on rolls. And if they do it within 90 to 120 days, their eligibility goes retro to the day they lost it. So we cover any claims in the interim, but also the premium for us goes retro back to the day they lost their eligibility. So very powerful on these reconnects. It's too early here in July for us to really see good data on reconnects. Most of our markets started in June, which means reconnects will just start coming in the next month or two, but a really powerful part of these enrollments. Yes. Just to add to that, levers are slightly lower on MLR. We're expecting a lot of reconnects. How will reconnects come back on MLR? Well, there's a theory out there that reconnects many of them will only become aware of their need to reconnect because they have another claim or another doc visit, which means when they're coming back on, they may come with a claim but they were also likely to come with two to three months of premium revenue. So I'm expecting pretty much a reversion to our mean as we see these reconnects and not a lot of volatility there. A.J., the only other thing I'd add is so many of our members are associated with family members and the incidence of one family member over the first couple of months needing medical care of some kind is high, which means the whole family gets renewed. So that's really a helpful fact as we think about these reconnects. On the marketplace question, you'll appreciate with special enrollment period, we're constantly picking up members month-to-month. That's a pretty routine phenomenon here. What will be different going forward is we'll start to pick up people that came off the Medicaid roles. Now we've got good visibility in special enrollment period, month-to-month, who's coming in from Medicaid. Who's coming in from our Medicaid plans, who's coming in from other Medicaid plans, those numbers are still quite de minimis. Within our special enrollment period gains. But I would expect them to pick up dramatically in the months ahead. Remember, June is still the first month that most folks came off. So July, August, September, I would expect to see the marketplace numbers start to creep up. And we're able to track those who's coming from Medicaid and what plans. And just to build on that, I feel good that we had a reasonable line of sight into Q2 as we put in our pricing for next year. Scott, just on your question on the rest of 2023, we're conservative guys within our guidance is mid-to-low 88 [ph] for the rest of the year, and that's within the guidance we've given. Well, a couple of things. Those couple of states that we already had rate concessions in the July 1 race. A very small part of our revenue and also done somewhat academically as the data hadn't developed in those states quite yet. All of that is incorporated in the guidance I've given you. But again, such a small component. I think I mentioned five states started their new fiscal year, July 1, representing just 10% of revenue, and the states that gave those concessions were a subset within that. So not really a big deal, but in guidance. Yep. Michael, what's your question about the prior year development? Yes. So... You got it exactly right. So in general, overall development was favorable. We take great confidence in quarter-after-quarter, our development is favorable. The prior year portion, as you point out, negative by a small amount. Typically, we would expect that to develop positively. But whenever there's a particular provider contracts settlement or something going on, it can create some noise. But in particular, what happened to this quarter was there's something some of you may be familiar with California SB 510, which was a specific court ruling that held health plans liable for certain COVID expenses. We've recognized that charge as did some of our other competitors this quarter, and that created a little bit of the noise you're seeing. Yes, into next year, specifically around Medicaid MLRs \u2013 it will be partly a function of these pricings and rate cycles that we're having, most of which are in front of us. 50% of our revenue comes up for our January 1 fiscal year. That \u2013 those pricing discussions, obviously, actuarial policies require that states recognize anything that goes on with redetermination. And then finally, as Joe mentioned, even into next year, those continuing corridors and minimum MLRs continue to give us great comfort on our projected margins. So not looking at a lot of volatility into next year. Yes. Thanks for the question, Kevin. I'm hesitant to give specific numbers because it differs state to state. But the real reason I'm hesitant to give the numbers is two things. One, for the most part, they were done academically, not on data they were done prospectively academically, so means they were guessing no better than all the rest of us were three months ago. So academic prospective. But the bigger point is you might get a specific concession for redetermination. But in the presence of seven or eight adjustments up and down for other reasons, it gets lost co-mingled into the grand scheme of things. We have to come back to the overall concept of actuarial soundness. And if those rates develop in a place that just aren't appropriate, we'll be back with our states to make sure that they are. I think that's right to build on that. Remember, two-thirds of these folks that are coming off are procedural, which means they don't even know that they're losing coverage. When they do, they'll either come back on to Medicaid or what a great chance to get them on the Marketplace. The only other thing I'd add, George, is when we think about benefit design, there are a number of items which for a competitive shopper are must-have. And there's a bunch of other things, which are part of the benefit load that are nice to have but don't necessarily influence the buying decision. You can imagine how we're thinking about changing benefit design. But we and our decisions probably won't be much different than the broader markets. So I'm expecting a pretty even competitive dynamic next year."

            "content": "Thank you, Joe, and good morning. Today we will provide updates on our financial results for the second quarter 2023, our full year 2023 guidance in the context of our second quarter results, Medicaid redeterminations and our growth initiatives, and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth, including our 2024 premium revenue growth drivers. Let me begin with the second quarter highlights. Last night, we've reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $5.65, or 24% year-over-year growth on $8 billion of premium revenue. Our 87.5% consolidated MCR in the second quarter demonstrates continued strong operating performance in medical cost management and was at the low end of our long-term target range. We produced a 5.3% adjusted pre-tax margin or 3.9% after tax, a very strong result that was above the high end of our long-term target range. Year-to-date, our consolidated MCR is 87.3% and our adjusted pre-tax margin is 5.4%. We note that investment income produced higher than expected results due to the increasing yield environment. In the second quarter, we continued to generate excellent margins in our Medicaid business with an MCR of 88.3%, bringing our year-to-date MCR to 88.4%. This result was in line with our full year guidance and long-term target range. As expected, the medical cost impact of redeterminations was negligible, although we are in the very early stages of that process. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 89.2%, which is above the high end of our long-term target range. We are experiencing some cost, pressure and professional and outpatient services and higher first year MCRs associated with growth. With a year-to-date Medicare MCR of 88.6%, the book of business continues to produce attractive margins. In Marketplace, our reported MCR was 73.7% for the quarter and 71.2% year-to-date. This result reflects the successful implementation of our pricing, metallic mix, and membership continuity strategies to restore this business to mid-single-digit target margins. In summary, our second quarter results built on our strong start to the year. Medicaid, our flagship business representing over 80% of revenue continues to produce strong, predictable operating results and cash flows. Our high acuity Medicare niche serving low-income members continues to grow organically and our Marketplace business is now well positioned to achieve target margins. Turning now to our 2023 guidance. Based on our strong second quarter results, we are increasing our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.50 per share to at least $20.75 or 16% growth year-over-year. Consistent with our long-term earnings per share growth target of 15% to 18%. Our earnings per share guidance is now $1 per diluted share higher than our initial guidance issued in February. Our pre-tax margins are exceeding our expectations. The Medicaid MCR is right on target, Medicare slightly behind target and marketplace substantially better. We note that these target ratios produce best in industry margins. Then of course, the interest rate environment has allowed us to produce investment income that has provided a short term earnings boost. Now, a few words on Medicaid redeterminations. During the second quarter, all but four of our states began disenrolling members with the remaining states initiating disenrollments on July 1. Our Medicaid membership declined by 93,000 members during the quarter, which was well within our expectations. Although the medical cost profile of members who have left is slightly more favorable than the portfolio average, the impact on our overall Medicaid MCR was negligible and within our expectations. We continued our outreach to members to minimize procedural disenrollment. We also continued to work with our state partners to ensure rates remain actuarially sound to account for any potential shifts in acuity. To date, all of our states have expressed a willingness to adjust rates as needed to account for any changes in acuity or trend. Mark will provide more color on redetermination during his remarks. Turning now to an update on our growth strategy. At our May Investor conference, we laid out our strategy for sustaining profitable growth. We plan to grow premiums at 13% to 15% through a combination of growth in our current footprint, strategic initiatives and accretive acquisitions. We also established a 2026 premium revenue target of $46 billion. We already have significant momentum toward achieving these growth goals. Our five recent state RFP wins drive more than $5 billion in incremental premium revenue. A portion of this incremental revenue is included in our 2023 guidance attributable to our Iowa contract, which we successfully launched July 1 with approximately 200,000 members consistent with our expectations. Most of the remainder emerges in our 2024 revenue outlook and a small component in 2025. We are also executing on the M&A component of our growth strategy consistent with our strategy of acquiring capitated government-sponsored assets. In June, we announced the acquisition of Bright HealthCare's California Medicare Business for an attractive purchase price of approximately 28% of expected 2023 premium revenue. Bright's Medicare business serves approximately 125,000 MAPD, D-SNP and C-SNP members across 23 counties in California with 60% membership overlap with Molina's Medicaid footprint. We expect the transaction to add approximately $1.8 billion of premium revenue, deliver $1 of adjusted earnings per share at full run rate, but no earnings contribution in the first full year of ownership. We expect the transaction to close by the first quarter of 2024. The closing is subject to the solvency and continued operation as a going concern of Bright Health Group throughout the pre-closing period, as well as federal and state regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. Based on known building blocks, we now have line of sight to approximately $38 billion of premium revenue in 2024 or 19% growth before executing on additional strategic initiatives. Our new store embedded earnings is now $5.50 per share, providing meaningful visibility into our future earnings growth potential. We see additional embedded earnings upside if and when the several remaining COVID era corridors are eliminated. Two short months ago at our Investor Day, we reaffirmed our long-term financial targets, the centerpiece of which is the long-term earnings per share annual growth rate of 15% to 18%. Our performance this quarter supports that outlook. The revenue base and new store earnings profile continue to build with highly accretive new contract wins and M&A. Our second quarter and year-to-date operating results provide a very solid earnings base off of which to grow, and we have seen nothing in the early stages of the Medicaid redetermination process that changes our view of the earnings trajectory of the business. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark? Sure, Josh, I'll start and then I'll kick it to Mark for some color. First of all, the rate cycle in terms of the \u2013 our portfolio of states and how the rate cycles emerge actually couldn't be better positioned for how the redetermination process is going to unfold. 25% of our revenue has rates that renew between April and July, another 25% in the early fall and 50% on January 1, which gives us good opportunity to have great visibility into any potential impact of redeterminations and engage in those discussions with the state, which are already occurring. Now as you know, and I'll note the impact of acuity shifts is a normal rating criteria. Rating criteria includes a credible medical cost baseline, a trend off the baseline, benefit changes, plus or minus, and any potential acuity shift. So the fact that there's an acuity shift that's speculated to occur is actually part of the dialogue we're already having in the states. Now only a handful of states actually implemented rates between April and July. And I'll hand it over to Mark and he can give you some color on how those discussions went. Justin, it's Joe, I'll kick it to Mark for some color. The marketplace business, our strategy of keep it small, silver and stable, plus starring in a 9% price increase for the year clearly has us on track for mid-single-digit margins. In fact, our guidance contemplates about just over 6% pretax margin for the full year. Now to your question, while you're at 71.2% for the first half, that must mean you're at 85% for the second half. Two factors. One, we're taking on special enrollment period membership as the year goes on. So as the year progresses, more \u2013 higher mix of your membership is special enrollment membership, which carries a higher initial MLR and second, a greater proportion of our book is in higher deductible products, which makes the seasonality toward the back half more dramatic than it has been in the past. 71% first half, 85% second half, 78% for the year. Mark, do you want to talk about the drop? And Justin, the last thing I would say on the topic, the return to mid-single-digit margins is really a result of that disciplined strategy that has worked and was executed perfectly for the year, 6% pretax for the full year not because of accounting adjustments, but because of the pricing discipline and the positioning of the book. Thank you. Well, the way we look at it, first of all, your pick on the yield curve would determine for the most part, what that would look like. But what we try to remind folks is that of our $8 billion portfolio, half is in intermediate term securities where we won't be immediately responsible to interest rate changes and the other half is in cash, which will be immediately responsible to interest rate changes. That's the first fact. And make your yield curve pick for the rest of the year. We certainly are forecasting lower interest rates for the back half of the year on our cash balance, which also will be reduced between mid-year and end of the year due to the payment of some significant government payables that we need to get paid. Mark, any more color? Let me just reframe the numbers, and I'll keep it to more. Our states have all have executed ex parte processes. The automatic renewal rates have ranged from 20% to 70%, which is actually quite high. On terminations, at least two-thirds of the terminations have been procedural, in some cases, up to 75%, which then means \u2013 and this is the important point on the procedural terminations. The number of reconnects of the members that will reconnect to the process within the 90- to 120-day grace period is actually expected to be quite high since the procedural termination rate was also quite high. Now we haven't seen that yet. Because this process just started. But we believe throughout the third quarter into the fourth, we're going to see significant reconnection activity, which will carry with it retroactive premium back to the initial data disenrollment. Mark, some color on the detail numbers? Didn't get the last part of your question. But yes, on the members that are disenrolling the medical loss ratio is slightly more favorable than the portfolio average as expected. All contemplated within the 88.5% medical care ratio that we projected for the Medicaid business for the full year. We have seen nothing that suggests that we will not be able to hit that. And bear in mind, as we mentioned many other times, we also have, in many of our states, either a corridor or a minimum MLR, that carries with it a rather significant liability that we've already recorded. Any medical cost inflection that happens in the back half of the year would be first absorbed by any corridor or minimum MLR liability before impacting our earnings. Mark? Well, I think on the first part of your question, first of all, state mix is really important. As we said in our prepared remarks, some states moved very aggressively initially, some states more cautiously. Some states, even \u2013 three of our states pause to let the administrative processes catch up with the flow of work. So I think state mix is really, really important as you judge any one company or any one state against sort of the market average. But we have seen nothing in the process that is outside of our expectations as we said. In terms of experience, we believe that a member will be reminded that they need to be on Medicaid if and when they have to go to the doctor or the emergency room or for some procedure. And as Mark said, maybe they'll come back with a claim, but they'll also come back with three or four months of retro premium. And that means the reversion to the mean to the portfolio average MCR is supported by that thesis. No, that comment did not relate to the properties that we acquired \u2013 the properties we acquired will carry with it the amount of regulatory capital needed to run the plan. They are underperforming on margin, but really good line of sight to membership and revenue. That comment was really to state that the ongoing, going concern in the financial solvency of the parent company would obviously be critical to their ability to close the transaction. That's all that referred to. The properties have intact revenue and will be delivered with the required amount of capital. Sure. I'll comment on the Bright acquisition first, and then we'll comment about the marketplace. This is the first Medicare acquisition we've done. And Medicare, as works on an annual cycle for star ratings, for risk adjustment for rates, et cetera. The business had its own profit improvement plan in place. So the answer to your question is unknown at the time. How much profit improvement will that business have during the period time to close, we don't know. We are still confident that whatever is delivered to us at the time of closing, we will be able to get that to our target margins by the end of the second year. So when we said no earnings contribution early because we don't know exactly what the financial status, the margin status of the plan that will be delivered to us will be at the time of closing. So breakeven initially a minimum, and then we'll build a target margin in a two year period, and we're very confident in the $1 estimate that we've given you. And just as a reminder, our membership forecast do not include the retention of Medicaid membership losses into our marketplace product. We didn't have a good estimate of what that would look like. We still don't \u2013 that would be upside to our membership projection. So Scott, our position on margin versus growth for Marketplace has not changed. We will position the business to earn mid-single-digit target margins and then allow it to grow at whatever rate can produce those margins, small, silver and stable. Now we've just put out a revenue estimate for next year an outlook of $38 billion or 19% growth year-over-year, which includes only a modest amount, a moderate amount of projected growth in Marketplace. So we do plan to allocate more capital to Marketplace next year, but the growth we anticipate by the prices we filed will be measured and moderate. We actually don't need to allocate more capital to Marketplace in order to produce high-teens growth rates in the business, 19% premium growth year-over-year with only modest and moderate growth in Marketplace since Medicaid is doing so well. Sure. For 2024, first of all, we are \u2013 we believe we were conservative in our trend estimates that we included in our Medicare bids for 2024. Second point is, recall, only about half our business actually relies on the Medicare bidding process. The other half is the MMP business, where we get rates that are not tied to that process. When it comes to star ratings and risk adjustment and all those other features and factors, again, the fact that we're in the half of the business is MNP is helpful to that process. And when it comes to stars, we have plenty of value-added benefits, the actuarial value of value-added benefits is significant as it is with competitors. So we believe that we can maintain margins by pulling back some of the ancillary benefits still have a very competitively priced product and a very competitively positioned product from a benefit perspective to continue to grow the business. Well, Sarah, I don't think we're going to comment on any particular state, but we \u2013 our protocols that we started building a year ago on member outreach and every state was different. Some states allowed significant involvement from MCOs, some states less so. Some states allow you to actually help the member reestablish eligibility by filling out forms. Some states didn't. Now as you know, CMS has stepped in and sort of suggested through policy statements that states should allow MCOs to be more involved in the reverification process. So I assure you that we are locked in to every single state in which we do business with the state regulatory authorities and are working hand in glove with them to make sure that everybody that should be on Medicaid is and people that shouldn't be thrown off Medicaid aren't. State by state. And yes, it has had an impact on our outreach efforts and gives us really good line of sight and good visibility into the fact that if a member should be on Medicaid, we're pretty confident between the state's efforts and our efforts that we'll be able to keep them in the system. Without getting into specifics, I will answer the question this way. Our due diligence process through a clean room process allowed us visibility into their bid through an independent third party. And we are confident that the transparency that was provided in that process gives us confidence that the bid was rational, included all trend factors that should be included in a bid. And as I said, their profit improvement plan is going to be the key factor. How much of that profit improvement did they actually achieve between sign and close in terms of what we inherit is actually going to determine whether \u2013 what the bet earnings picture looks like at the point of closing. I'll keep the PPD question to Mark, but on the Medicare MLR, it was outpatient, mostly ambulatory surgeries. Our population really doesn't have a lot of the hips, knees and joints that you'd see in a more standard Medicare advance population. But we're also seeing PCP visits and the typical routine preventive screenings come back. I won't call it pent-up demand, but returning to normal, the types of services that Medicare patients and members normally get. Ambulatory surgeries, PCP visits, preventive screenings and care, a little bit of drug usage, but not a lot. And keep in mind, we're only operating \u2013 I need to \u2013 I'm not rationalized again, 120 basis points above the top end of our range. The Medicare book is well positioned to earn a 4.5% pretax margin this year. So we're in good shape there. Mark, do you want to talk about the PPD? Well, Steven, since we haven't changed our outlook for the redetermination process, 800,000 members up, 400,000 down, $1.6 billion in premium, one third this year, two thirds next and an 88.5% Medicaid MCR for the year. Since we haven't changed all our acuity determination and we're holding firm on our Medicaid outlook \u2013 Medicaid MLR outlook for the year \u2013 that's all been contemplated. So we're in good shape there. We see nothing that causes us to change that point of view. The fact that the MCRs of levers is slightly more favorable than the portfolio average is not a surprise, and it's maybe not as dramatic as one might think. The other point to make and bear in mind, and we don't disclose year-by-year how much of this we have. But most of our states have some form of either minimum MLR or some type of corridor program that we are well into because we operate very efficiently, we historically have paid into these mechanisms. Any intra-year impact from on medical margin, whether it's trend or whether it's yield, would be first absorbed by the significant liabilities we have already recorded for these conventions. That gives us great confidence that the 88.5% is a very good estimate for the year, all contemplated within the $20.75 guide for the year. Mark, do you want to talk about maybe some of the bridging items in the next year? It's really hard to say. First of all, our Medicare book, the profile of it is vastly different than many of the other books of business. This is not mainstream MAPD. This is high acuity, D-SNP and the demonstrations, which are the fully integrated Medicare and Medicaid product. So the population is vastly different. Look, our trends in the quarter were very simple to understand, 3% in Medicaid, 6% in Medicare, 7.5% in Marketplace. All well within expectations. And I would just say that the mix of the book of business and the profile of the book of business better said, is probably reasons for some of the differential as competitors report their results. I don't think there's any discernible answer to that. The 81% of our book of business is Medicaid. The trend is behaving exactly within our expectations. And why one is behaving slightly hotter or more warm than the other, it's hard to tell. Well, the process \u2013 again, it's early. The process is in full gear. We have robust distribution channels internally, call center employees or licensed agents who know how to do this, and the warm transfer process is enacted and in process. All we're saying is because it's so early, we have not seen a huge uptick in the number of marketplace members we're getting out of Medicaid. We track what we obtain in marketplace out of our own Medicaid plans, but we also track what we get in the marketplace from other Medicaid plans. And because it's drilling the process, all we're saying is that monthly figure has not increased dramatically, but we expect it will as this process gets more traction. Yes. Right now, I think the way to look at it is Medicare doesn't pay for off-label uses. And when it comes to the individual states, some do allow it for weight control and many don't. But as they contemplate it, it's a rate discussion. My view is there's no medical cost that is inappropriate. If there's a medical cost or a benefit that's included in the program as long as it's rated for that's fine. So the trend in these prescriptions is well known and well documented. Some states already included in their formularies, others don't. And when that conversation comes up, then it's a conversation between actuaries in terms of the pharmacy component of the rate and whether it covers the $12,000 a year that it's going to cost to dispense one of these prescriptions. George, we couldn't hear the first part of your question. Are you talking about Medicare Advantage? Yes. No, I understand. We're not going to begin to publish sort of the percentage of actuarial value of the product that's represented by ancillary benefits. But it's significant. Our products are very competitive. With all the types of benefits, vision, dental, those cash card benefits, travel benefits, gym memberships, all those things are included in the product. And our competitive intelligence and analysis suggests that we can have a zero premium product with competitive benefits if and when our star ratings aren't necessarily benchmarked with the rest of the market. We're not going to size that, but we're pretty confident that we can pull in benefits marginally, still have a very, very robust product in respect to ancillary benefits and still be competitive. And with no other calls, that concludes our call today. Thank you, everyone."

Lastly, we want to invite you to attend our 2023 Investor Day meeting scheduled for Monday, May 15, where we will share more about our future growth plans and longer term strategy. Details for the event can be found in our Investor Relations website. I will now turn the call over to Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?\nJoe Zubretsky: Thank you, Joe, and good morning. Today, we will provide updates on our financial results for the first quarter 2023, our full year 2023 guidance in the context of our first quarter results and our growth initiatives and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Let me start with the first quarter highlights. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of $5.81 or 19% year-over-year growth. Total premium revenues at $7.9 billion were as expected, representing a 5% increase over the prior year. Our 87.1% consolidated MCR in the first quarter demonstrates continued strong operating performance. We produced a 5.5% adjusted pretax margin, 4.1% after-tax, a very strong result that is above the high-end of our long-term target range. In the first quarter, we continued to generate excellent margins in our Medicaid business with a medical care ratio of 88.4%. This result was in line with our guidance and long-term target range. Our portfolio of 19 state contracts in 2023 growing to 21 states in 2024, provides earnings [balanced] (ph) and diversification related to rate setting and contract reprocurements. Actuarially sound rates prevail, as the rate-setting process continues to capture a credible medical cost baseline with forward trend and benefit changes and core medical cost trends remained stable and well-controlled. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 88%, which is at the high-end of our long-term target range as a result of driving growth into high acuity low-income consumer segment. In Marketplace, we ended the quarter with 271,000 members. Our Marketplace business is appropriately sized in the overall portfolio, given the inherent volatility of that risk pool. Our first quarter Marketplace MCR was 68.6%, significantly below full year expectations even when considering seasonal patterns. This result reflects the successful implementation of our pricing, metallic mix and membership continuity strategy to restore this business to mid-single digit target margins. In summary, 2023 is off to a very strong start. Medicaid, our flagship business representing over 80% of revenue continues to produce strong predictable operating results and cash flows. Our high acuity Medicare niche serving low income members continues to grow organically and Marketplace is now well positioned to achieve target margins in 2023. Turning now to our 2023 guidance. Based on our strong start to the year, we are increasing our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance to no less than $20.25 or 30% growth year-over-year, even after absorbing $0.75 of one-time implementation costs for new contract wins. We have deliberately reframed from increasing our guidance beyond the first quarter outperformance as we continue to apply appropriate conservatism to our forecast. We believe this conservative discipline is appropriate for several reasons. First, we would not project our significant first quarter Marketplace outperformance to be repeated for the balance of the year. Second, we are not forecasting short-term interest rates to remain at their current levels. Third, as a general matter at this early-stage in the year, it is prudent to anticipate potential medical cost variations. And fourth, and lastly, we do not believe the acuity shift due to redeterminations will have a significant net margin impact, but there is the potential for some sporadic and isolated shifts in acuity. If that were to be the case, there are significant mitigants to any potential impact. These mitigants include a commensurate mix effect premium benefit, experienced rebate and minimum MLR offsets in certain states, and of course, actuarially sound rate adjustments, both retrospective and prospective. That being said, we believe that any potential shift in Medicaid member acuity that could increase medical costs for 2023 is captured in our 88.5% Medicaid MCR guidance for the year. Turning now to an update on our strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Building on our momentum from last year, we are off to a strong start in 2023. At the end of January, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission posted its intent to award our Texas Health Plan, a contract for all our existing eight service areas in the state. Given the continuity of coverage in these service areas and strong brand loyalty, we expect to see continued market share gains and revenue upside in Texas. In March, we announced that our Indiana Health plan was awarded a four year contract to provide managed long-term services and supports. We believe this contract will commence in mid-2024. As one of four managed care organizations in the program, we expect to serve approximately 33,000 members, resulting in annual premium revenue of approximately $1 billion. With the addition of the Indiana LTSS win, our five recent state RFP wins driving within $5 billion in incremental revenue, with a portion included in our 2023 guidance, but most emerging in our 2024 outlook and achieving full run rate in 2025. Based on known building blocks, we now have line of sight to $36 billion of premium revenue in 2024 or 13% growth before additional strategic initiatives. Our new store embedded earnings are now $4.50 per share, providing meaningful visibility into our future earnings growth potential. We see an additional $2 per share of embedded earnings upside if and when the several remaining COVID era corridors are eliminated. Our acquisition pipeline remains replete with actionable opportunities. While the timing of transactions remains inherently difficult to predict, the strength of our pipeline and our track record of success give us confidence in our ability to drive further growth from this important element of our growth strategy. The company's performance continues to validate our long-term strategy, and its value creation potential. Our strategy is sound and it's working. We are delivering topline growth, both organically and with accretive acquisitions, while sustaining industry leading margins. Our model is clear and proven. We will grow organically in our existing footprint. We will win new state contracts and sign new acquisitions, building clear visibility to new store revenues and their related embedded earnings. We will harvest the embedded earnings and include them in our guidance as the contracts incept and the acquisitions closed, all while adding yet additional new revenue streams to our forward outlook. I look-forward to sharing more about our future growth plans and longer-term strategy at our Investor Meeting on May 15th. As is our hallmark style, we will provide you with our detailed playbook for achieving our growth targets and maintaining industry-leading margins. We will not only [declare those] (ph) but also show you with transparency and specificity, how we will achieve them. Our May 15th Investor Day session is appropriately titled, sustaining profitable growth, the next wave. With that I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark?\nMark Keim: Thanks, Joe, and good morning everyone. This morning I will discuss some additional details of our first quarter performance. I'll then turn to the balance sheet and some thoughts on our 2023 guidance. Beginning with some detailed commentary on our first-quarter results, our consolidated MCR for the first-quarter was 87.1%, reflecting continued strong medical cost management in each of our segments. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was 88.4%, a strong result that was in-line with our expectations and long-term target. During the quarter, flu, RSV and COVID related medical costs were minimal. The major medical cost categories were largely in-line with our expectation and normal quarter-to-quarter trend fluctuations. In the quarter, our Medicaid results were burdened with the prior-period premium adjustments. Absent those adjustments, our MCR was at the low-end of our long-term target range. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 88%, also within our long-term target range. During the quarter, we saw sharply lower flu and a continuing decline of COVID related costs, somewhat offset by the impact from continued growth in our D-SNP and MAPD products. In Marketplace, our reported MCR was 68.6%. This strong result reflects our pricing strategy to return this business to target margins, as well as seasonal patterns, which favored the first-half of the year. Recall, our pricing strategy increased our premium yield by approximately 9% this year and with approximately three quarters of our book in renewing members and two-thirds [indiscernible] metallic products, our risk scores should be optimally valued. We feel well-positioned to achieve our Mid-single digit target margins in this business for the year. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7.2% which includes new business implementation spending ahead of the new contract wins, incepting in July and next year. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. We harvested $100 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter and our quarter-end parent company cash balance was $283 million. Debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged and just 1.7 times trailing 12 months EBITDA with debt to cap ratio at 42.3%. Net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.5 times and 39.3%, respectively, reflecting our low leverage position and ample cash and capital capacity for additional growth and investments. Turning to reserves, our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and we continue to be confident in the strength of our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was one day higher sequentially at 48 days of medical cost expense. Prior year development was favorable in the quarter demonstrating the integrity of our actuarial and reserving practices. I would note that the reported favorable prior year development, includes the release of margins on the prior year reserves, which is reestablished in the current quarter. And remaining P&L impact was largely absorbed by prior year minimum MLRs and experienced rebates. Finally, a few comments on guidance. We increased our 2023 adjusted earnings guidance by $0.50 to at least $20.25 per share. This increase is driven by first-quarter performance above our expectations. Partially offset by additional new store implementation costs for our recently-announced Indiana LTSS win and some general early in the year conservativism. We projected a little more than half of this year's earnings in the first two quarters. As Joe mentioned, our new-store embedded earnings in 2023 is now expected to be $4.50 per share comprised of two components: $4 per share, up from previously reported $3.50 for our recent new contract wins in California, Iowa, Nebraska and now including our new Indiana LTSS contract, plus $0.50 per share for the AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin acquisitions achieving their full run-rate accretion. We continue to carry approximately $2 per share for COVID era risk corridors, providing additional potential upside to the $4.50 of new-store embedded earnings. Within our guidance, our outlook on the resumption of redeterminations and the impact on our business is unchanged. Through March closing, we estimate we gained approximately 800,000 members organically since the start of the pandemic. We continue to expect to retain roughly half of the members gained. We expect the premium impact to be approximately $1.6 billion and that portfolio average margins the earnings impact to be approximately $1 per share. Due to the timing of when members dis-enrolled, we are projecting one-third of the premium and earnings impact to emerge in 2023 with the remainder mostly in 2024. Given that redetermination and disenrollment have just begun on April 1st in only one of our markets, we are unable to share additional data driven insights. However, we remain comfortable with our outlook on margins as we expect numerous items to minimize any potential trend impact from redetermination. First, as discussed in past quarters, our internal membership cohort analysis indicates limited acuity shift potential from several perspectives. Second, the mix effect of impacted membership cohorts dampens the impact. To be clear, redetermination likely effects lower PMPM members. So any cost pressure would be muted by the weighted average of continuing higher premium PMPM members. Third, the gradual rate of dis enrollment over the course of 2023 into 2024 dilutes any ultimate impact ahead of normal rate cycle adjustments. Fourth, the remaining COVID era risk corridors and pre-existing experienced rebate mechanisms as minimum MLR's in many states provides a cushion to absorb potential adverse trend development should it emerge. And finally, rate adjustments, both on-cycle and off-cycle prospective or retrospective will countering emerging trends as states honor their commitments for actuarially sound rates. In summary, we are very pleased with our first-quarter performance in each of our segments and our increased full-year earnings guidance. We look forward to sharing more about our growth strategy and compelling value creation story at our May 15th Investor Day. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Appreciate the comments you just made, Mark, on the re-verification impact and that you'll keep 400,000 of the 800,000 lives that you gained since the start of the pandemic. But of the 400,000 that get redetermined, can you just update us on your views on how many you think end-up in -- of those Medicaid lives end-up choosing exchanges? And then how granular can you be in terms of assisting your specific re-verified members to find in exchanges. For example, can you target specific populations or even specific individuals in terms of trying to get them to choose exchange products? Thanks.\nMark Keim: Great, thanks for the questions, Josh. I'll take the second one first. The states have a lot of different protocols and policies about how we can interact with members ahead of redetermination. The good news is, they're giving us the list of at risk members months ahead of time, which is very helpful to reach-out to them, interact with them, see if we can re-verify them or in many cases, put them into our Marketplace product if appropriate. Now in the cases where members are being redetermined, they lose their eligibility, which we're estimating is about 50%. I don't know that I had great insights on specifically where they'll go. And Josh, it's complicated, because what we see is some will get re-verified, lose eligibility and move right into another product, others may go uninsured for a few months and then eventually wind-up in one of those products. So I don't have good estimates on that. The only other thing I'll remind you of is, we didn't put any upside on retaining redetermined members in our Marketplace outlook. So anything that we pick up through redetermination is upside to our Marketplace outlook.\nJosh Raskin: Perfect, thanks.\nMark Keim: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Stephen Baxter at Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: Yes. Hi, thanks for the question. I appreciate that you're thinking on redeterminations hasn't really changed. Over the past few months, though, we have seen a lot of states come out with their own projections on membership losses. It does seem like these estimates would generally skew towards lower levels of retention and 50%. You're assuming -- I assume you spend time talking to the states about their expectations. I'm curious what you think is the key difference between what they're assuming and what you think will play out? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Stephen, our analysis is bottoms up state-by-state. And of course, we are in active discussions with our state-based customers and helping them manage the 90 million people nationwide and we're going to go through the redetermination process. As Mark had mentioned, many of the states have various protocols and different protocols on how interactive we can be. But we are in very active discussions with our state-based customers. They have given us a list of what they consider at risk members, meaning, members that will likely have to go through a reverification process. And from everything we've learned since this all started months ago and now has only started in one state actually in the month of April, we stand pretty firm that our 800,000 member increase during the pandemic will decrease by 50% and end up at 400,000.\nMark Keim: And just to put a point on what Joe said, Stephen, maybe what you're reacting to is some of the at-risk member data points. The states are putting those out specifically so that managed care organizations can reach out to those members and whether its eligibility issues or verification issues, interact with those members to minimize it. So the list of at-risk is certainly bigger than the list of folks that will actually lose eligibility.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, our next question today comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks, good morning. A couple of things. One, Medicare Advantage, you talked about mix pushing you to the higher end of the MLR range there. What is the long-term MLR range you expect for Medicare Advantage? And can you give us a little color on the mix of business and why it's pushing it towards the higher end? And then lastly, just a number question on investment income, what is assumed in your guidance for investment income this year? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Justin, on the MLRs for Medicare, we continue to hold firm on our long-term forecast of between 87% and 88%. And I would just summarize it by saying, the faster we grow, it would push you towards the higher end of that range because the members we yet -- are not yet risk-scored, they're not yet into care management programs. And it takes a while for that a year or two for that MLR to settle back into our target range. So if we're growing nicely, which we are today at greater than 10% a year, it will push the MLR up into the higher end of that range, and we're very comfortable with that. On investment income, sure, short-term interest rates are very high currently. As our guidance suggested, we do not forecast them to remain at this level. I will remind you that half of our investable base is locked in at two to three year duration in short-term bonds. But the other half is entirely floating, it's cash and it's floating at short-term rates. And Mark and his team were, I think, appropriately cautious in projecting those rates to decline for the balance of the year.\nMark Keim: Yes, that's exactly right, Joe. The things to think about there is the investable balance will decline over the year from where it is and about $8.2 billion right now. It will decline as we pay down previous year corridors, minimum MLRs, things like that. Second, we're mostly in cash, which means we're instantly responsive to any cuts in rates. And when I look at the Fed funds outlook, most folks are baking in maybe another raise in the second quarter, but likely two cuts in the back half of the year. So we are cautious in our outlook.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, our next question today from comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Great, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on the Marketplace business. How much of the outperformance, do you see as sustainable? It sounded like it was mainly driven by pricing and I guess, helped by strong retention. I guess, do you have an updated view of where MCR will land for the year? And then enrollment was a little bit lower than we had expected. I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on if 230,000 members by year-end is still the right target.\nJoe Zubretsky: Nathan, it's Joe. Our strategy is working. The strategy to reallocate capital to businesses that add less inherent volatility like Medicare and Medicaid and to keep this at about 5% of the portfolio keeping it small, 5% of the portfolio, keeping its silver with two-thirds of our members in silver products and keeping it stable, 75% of the members renewing. Not only as is projected toward our target mid-single digit pretax target margins, but probably with less inherent volatility. So we're really pleased with that. The first quarter MCR had some seasonality aspects to it, and we did outperform. I would say that our guidance includes something closer to the bottom end of our long term range of 78% to 80%, perhaps a little lower than that. But particularly that more of the business was bronze than we had projected and bronze has higher deductibles. The seasonality tilt is a little steeper than we originally projected. We're on target for the bottom end of our 78% to 80% long-term target range for the full year.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Scott Fidel at Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to get some of your analysis on the final 2024 MA rates and then on the risk model as well in terms of what your estimated -- your MA rate impact will be? And then maybe give us some insights just into how you're thinking about the impact of the risk model to your particular membership base, which is heavily weighted, obviously, towards D-SNPs? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Scott, it's Joe. Yes, there are a variety of factors, regulatory factors that have been introduced in the past number of months that have caused folks in the Medicare Advantage business to think differently about the earnings trajectory. First, let me remind everyone that Medicare is only 15% of our total book. Also remind you that of that Medicare book, half of it are the MMP demonstrations. Now while MMP demonstrations aren't totally insulated from these industry dynamics, they do not have STARS scores. They're not subject to the rate notice, although rates come in a different way, 40% of that revenue is actually Medicaid driven and not Medicare-driven. So I wouldn't say we're insulated from it, but with half the book being in MMP, which is not responsive to those various rate type actions. We're pretty well insulated. But it does relate to our D-SNP book. We believe that our product is competitive. It is replete with value-added benefits. Many of these factors affected the entire market. So, if we have to pull back on value-added benefits to keep the product at zero premium and competitive, we think we can do so. I think we're well positioned for a couple of other good years in Medicare.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Michael Hall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Hall: Thank you. Just quickly first on Medicaid revenue PMPM looks like it was roughly flat year-to-year, which may have driven your Medicaid revenue to be slightly below the street this quarter. I am having a tough time just thinking of what could have driven this, especially given higher LTSS mix, which presumably would have increased the blended PMPM. So any color you could provide there? And then on your comments about redeterminations, not expecting the acuity shift to have net margin impact, but could see some strategic cases. And I know you mentioned, Joe, that the shift in acuity captured in your current 88.5% guide. But comments today do sound a bit more optimistic. Is it fair to say what you've learned since fourth quarter about the acuity of your at-risk redetermined lives might be more incrementally positive?\nJoe Zubretsky: I'm going to take the second part of the question first and kick it to Mark for the analysis of Medicaid revenue. No, we know very little more than we knew at the fourth quarter. Only one state has actually started the redetermination process, and it's a very small state for us. Now we believe that our cohort analysis, which analyzes various aspects of durational acuity, how many members do you have greater than a year or less than a year. How many members do you have that have zero 25% MCR. What's your lapse rate. Didn't go to zero, it decreased, but members were terminating during the pandemic. What's your coordination of benefits rates. It's up slightly, but not a lot. So the data does not suggest that there's a huge shift of members, durational acuity members, and we start there. Second, all we did was mention the mitigants that if something should occur somewhere in one of our markets. There's premium adjustments, premium mix will help us if we're deep into a rebate mechanism or a minimum MLR in that market, that will be the first cushion for a potential effect. And then, of course, you're into the rate cycle. And we believe -- not we believe, we know that the state and CMS have been in active discussions about what could potentially happen and they are not only amenable, but they're very supportive of potential retrospective or prospective rate actions. So that's our point of view. It really hasn't changed from the fourth quarter because we know very little more today than we do at that point.\nMark Keim: And Michael, it's Mark. Let me just take the first question on Medicaid, not sure what your model was, but the Medicaid revenue for me came in right about on expectation. But there's things that can move it a little up, a little down quarter-to-quarter, which might be driving some of what you're seeing. Certainly, mix changes quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year. Retro premiums, which are driven by a number of different items, retro membership updates, things like that certainly drive variations in revenues. And don't forget when we book corridors, minimum MLRs or any form of experience rebates, those run through the revenue line as well. So you put those things together, my hunch is, that's what explains what you're seeing. But overall, I think we're pretty close to just out everybody's model on first quarter.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from George Hill at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Yes. Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. Joe, one of your competitors talked about kind of getting enhanced from the states as they start to go through the redetermination process. Would just be interested to hear kind of like what kind of data that you guys are having access to as this process begins to kick off and kind of how that impacts your early thoughts about 2024?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure. I'll send to Mark. But for the most part, what we're getting from states is what we're calling members at risk, members that will have to go through some form of process, either specifically or on an [indiscernible] basis to be redetermined. Mark, you're closer to the situation.\nMark Keim: Absolutely. So we started one state in April, but the vast majority of my states won't actually go through eligibility and redetermination until June and July. So, we're fairly back-end loaded here, which is why we're a little limited on data just at the moment. We've got one state. But as Joe mentioned, the way this works is long before a member would actually get redetermined or lose eligibility, they go on in at-risk list. And the states define at-risk in two ways. One, places where they have some data that suggests the member will lose eligibility, some data point that suggests that or just verification failures where they can't reach that number. They're giving us those lists months in advance. So I\u2019m mostly back ended for June and July. But in many cases, I have a list of those members already. We can start reaching out to them, contacting them through all of our different channels long in advance. Now that data is not particularly helpful on what will happen because the whole point of that data is to preempt some of the people that shouldn't lose coverage. So, it's very helpful on us retaining members, but it's not helpful in saying from a data perspective, how many will we lose or what would the economic impact be, if any? Now the real data points on real stairs and levers don't happen until redetermination actually occurs. And again, for us, that's just one state so far. The states published files 834s, 820s, which let us know specifically who's coming and going, who the stairs and levers are. And we're way too early to have real insights on that given one state so far.\nGeorge Hill: Okay. So maybe just a quick follow-up to simplify this is, what you guys largely have now is kind of the medical data and the claims data on all these members. You guys don't have the economic and eligibility data, and it's kind of the eligibility. Like, I'm trying to figure out what is the data like, what changes from a data access perspective that kind of better informs what you guys see? And it sounds like it's really kind of like the eligibility data and the at-risk list.\nJoe Zubretsky: Yes. Just because the member has been identified as someone who will have to go through the reeligibility process. And by the way, that data is very immature. It's not in hundreds of thousands of members. It's tens of thousands of members. We can extrapolate very little from that. And so, it's way too early to make -- draw any conclusions from the early at-risk member data that we've seen. It will build over time. And as we have insights and we report quarters, we'll fill you in on where we are.\nGeorge Hill: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Rice: Hi, everybody. Thanks for the question. Two, I guess, really. One, when you think about the flow of information as it comes in both on the -- your enrollment assumptions and whether they're correct and then also on the risk pool itself and what's happening there when you think about claims experience, et cetera. How do you see incremental information developing? When -- at what point over the next 12 months do you think you'll have a pretty good sense that, hey, our estimates are pretty accurate on enrollment, our estimates about the risk pool are pretty accurate. I guess I'm trying to figure out, was that a fourth quarter of this year? Is it a first half of next year? Any thoughts on that? And then you've mentioned a couple of times some protection from being in a Medicaid corridor payable position. I guess, I'd love to get a little bit more color, if there is any, on how extensive that is across your Medicaid book rather and how much protection you think that provides on kind of deterioration in the risk pools?\nJoe Zubretsky: A.J., I'll answer the second first. We talked about risk-sharing corridors during the pandemic that were introduced in a dozen of our states as a direct result of the pandemic. Reminding everyone that pre-pandemic, dating all the way back to earlier in the decade, various types of mechanisms existed in 17 of our states, MLR floors experience rebates. Those have always been in place. And because of our performance, we routinely pay into them. The better you perform, the more you'll pay into them. And the more you pay into them, the greater the cushion should your fortunes reverse later in the year. So we're not going to go through the actual numbers because it actually matters where you're in the money, in what state and it's way too difficult to project anything other than we have routinely paid into these mechanisms, the experience rebates, we did last year in 2022 because we were very profitable. Reminding you, we still have best-in-class industry margins even after having paid into them. And yes, should an inflection occur later in the year for whatever reason, redetermination for any other reason, these payables act as the first cushion to financial performance. Mark, do you want to take the question about what quarter we'll have visibility? We've talked about that a lot. And it\u2019s might be third, more likely fourth.\nMark Keim: Absolutely. I mentioned that the majority of our states don't actually redetermine members. That is, take members off the roles until June and July. So we, across our 18 Medicaid states are very back-end loaded. That means the true data development won't really start to accrue until Q3 and Q4. Now remember, these states have a year to go through this process. Some will move a little faster, some will move a little bit slower. But picture on a weighted average going down over time, this data will start to develop, and I think we'll have a meaningful discussion in Q3 and Q4 on real data-driven insights.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Calvin Sternick with JPMorgan.\nCalvin Sternick: Yes. Thank for the question. Sort of a follow-up to A.J's . In terms of the potential mitigants. As you go through the discussions of the states as they finalize their implementation plans for determinations, do you have a sense for how they're thinking about making the rate adjustments are most looking at it doing it on a retrospective basis? Or is it mostly perspective? And then do you have a sense for what level of margin degradation needs to occur before the state sort of look to step in there? And any color on whether like how many we could look to do it off-cycle versus how many would look to do on-cycle adjustments? Thanks. A - Joe Zubretsky Calvin, I'll start and I'll kick it to Mark for a more detailed discussion. But the timing of how the redetermination process is unfolding couldn't actually be better timed with the timing of our rate cycles. We have a September 1, we have an October 1. But for the most part, we're January 1. In early discussions with many of our states, they're willing to have discussions about both retrospective rate adjustments and prospective rate adjustments, and they're willing to have a conversation on-cycle and off-cycle. The conversations have been very productive. I can't speculate as to how much of an acuity shift would actually cause them to take action, but their actuarial resources, CMS's actuarial resources are all very much geared to engaging in a conversation both on a retrospective and prospective basis in both on and off cycle. As this information unfolds, we will be smack dab in the middle of our January 1 traditional rate cycle, which couldn't be better timing.\nMark Keim: Hi, Calvin, it's Mark. Joe got it exactly right. The majority of our states, the calendar year is the same as the fiscal year. Which means, if data is developing in the third and fourth quarters it positions you very well for an on-cycle rate review. Now at least two of our states have already committed to a mid-cycle rate review as well, anticipating that at least we should look at the data together. So we feel good about that. Overall, I think on the topic of retrospective and prospective, states have been really open to both. And in many cases, I think they're waiting for the initial gimps of data to decide on-cycle, off-cycle, retrospective, prospective, how they might do that. But the general signal from the states is very much of a partnership here to work through this rate cycle.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Sarah James of Cantor. Please go ahead. Sarah, your line is muted perhaps.\nSarah James: Yes. Sorry about that. So I wanted to follow-up on the timings. As far as your discussions with state goes, they have 12 months to get through the redetermination, but some of the states have been vocal about staffing issues on teams that would be evaluating that. So as you talk to them, what kind of color are they giving you on how ratable or front-end loaded their process might be? And then just to follow-up on your earlier bronze mix shift in the exchanges. Has that influenced how you accrue for risk adjusters versus past years, given the shift in metal tier? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Sarah, I'll answer the last question first, and Mark and I will tag team the question on timing. With respect to bronze, we've limited bronze to four markets, three markets require us to sell it. In Florida, we actually want to sell it because it's a bronze market, and it's very profitable. We sold more in Florida this year, which accounts for most of the -- the shift to bronze wasn't significant, but it was entirely accounted for our Florida sales efforts, and it's very profitable in Florida. It does add to the seasonality tilt since Bronze has higher deductibles. But we're very comfortable on the profitability of the bronze book because most of the states where we actually want to sell and try to sell. Mark, on the other question?\nMark Keim: Yes. Hi, Sarah. On your about timing, don't forget the states have 12 months from the end of the PHE to complete redetermination, the PHE ends in May. So even though some states began redetermination in April, the clock starts ticking as of May. So 12 months from May, I think there may be a difference between states intentions of how fast they move versus how fast they actually move. And we're seeing a little bit of that in some of our partnership discussions with them. So we'll obviously be accommodative of any schedule they want to roll out. But staffing issues, resource issues, it will be interesting to see how the next 13 months here play out.\nJoe Zubretsky: I'll give you the editorial comment. We have not projected it to take longer than we said originally. But I expect that it would. And states are going to be -- most states will be very careful to make sure they don't strain members without coverage if they're in fact eligible. We're not projecting it to take longer, but it could be more back-end loaded than we have projected.\nSarah James: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. For the first quarter itself, Mark, you mentioned that the major medical cost categories were largely in line with your expectations. So I guess just trying to reconcile this with some of the strong inpatient and surgical volume growth trends coming out of the public hospital companies this quarter. Just curious if you can just remind us what magnitude you may have anticipated this and factor that into the guidance across the different books of business as far as any sort of extraordinary growth in inpatient? Medicaid and Medicare MLRs were still both up year-over-year in 1Q 2023 versus 1Q 2022 despite the MLR beat versus the street. But again, just curious how much elevated inpatient costs maybe not have been a factor in the MLR dynamics in the first quarter? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: Steven, our medical cost trends were completely in line with expectations, flat in Medicaid, 2% in Medicare, 3% in Marketplace year-over-year. We saw an increase in utilization, but it's important to note when we say that to make the companion statement that expensive inpatient stays were down but less expensive. Our outpatient services, ambulatory services were up. So [indiscernible] were up, but the intensity of service and the types of services really reduce unit costs. Our trends were completely in line. We saw nothing in the quarter that wasn't expected or anticipated, trends are completely in line with what we assumed in pricing.\nMark Keim: Right. On inpatient, I hear you on the data points, but we're seeing just something just a little bit different. Lower surgical and obviously, lower COVID as the effects of the pandemic are diminishing, but also increasingly outpatient type of care for COVID cases. So as Joe mentioned, a fairly light trend for the first quarter.\nJoe Zubretsky: COVID has gone from almost being completely and inpatient phenomenon to almost completely a laboratory phenomenon. You trade one inpatient -- the cost of one inpatient stay for one lab test all the time. So it has changed dramatically year-over-year, some pandemic-related and some just trend-related.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, our last question today comes from Gary Taylor at Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Two quick ones for me. Just one, I think I missed just a little bit of the opening comment on exchange. So I just want to go back to that for a second. I know that trended better than you thought, but I didn't hear if that change where you thought you would land on your original 78% to 80% for the year. And then I just also wondered if anything you've seen so far makes you change your outlook on whether you have a receivable or a payable accrual in exchange for 2023?\nJoe Zubretsky: Gary, our fast start to the year and the exchanges at 68.6% gives us great comfort that we'll operate at or below the low end of our long-term target range of 78% to 80% on the MCR. A little bit more seasonality due to the heavier than expected bronze mix, but completely in line with expectations. We are on target to hit our mid-single digit margin target for the year. With respect to the risk pool, the risk pool has really stabilized. A lot of the irresponsible pricing is out of the market. We have our arms around special enrollment. It's coming in at much lower levels due to the cutoff at 150% of FPL. So we have our arms around that. The risk pool has somewhat stabilized, which gives us really good visibility, not only into the acuity of our members, given that 75% of them are renewed members, but also two-thirds of them are in a silver product, which gives us the opportunity to optimize the value of a risk floor. We're in good shape on the marketplace so far, and we expect to operate at the low end of our long-term target range for the full year.\nMark Keim: The only thing I'd add to that is, with risk adjustment, the correlation between medical cost experience and risk adjustment at this point is pretty tight. So if the risk pool changes a little bit, I'm expecting effectively a hedge from our performance on risk adjustment.\nGary Taylor: And then just last quick one, if I could. You mentioned the prior period premium adjustments in Medicaid having impact on Medicaid MLR. I mean, presumably, there is a pretax earnings headwind that you bore in the quarter for that as well?\nJoe Zubretsky: Yes. Given where we performed -- I'm sorry, we couldn't hear the first part of your, you're referring to Medicaid, correct?\nGary Taylor: Medicaid, yes.\nJoe Zubretsky: Thank you. Yes. As I said, 17 of our states have always for a long period of time had mechanisms, experienced rebate mechanisms and minimum MLR mechanisms, which are set at pretty low levels, which allow you to actually earn excellent margins as we have been even though we still have been paying into these mechanisms. So yes, as I mentioned, last year, we had a good year and paid into them. And in the first quarter, again, good first quarter. We also paid into them in the first quarter. We don't disclose how much, but it's a routine part of the business. It's part of the overall earnings trajectory of how we think about the business and the first quarter was business as usual, excellent margins in Medicaid and still paid into these corridors and rabates.\nGary Taylor: Thank you\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session and today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. And have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Keim",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and good morning everyone. This morning I will discuss some additional details of our first quarter performance. I'll then turn to the balance sheet and some thoughts on our 2023 guidance. Beginning with some detailed commentary on our first-quarter results, our consolidated MCR for the first-quarter was 87.1%, reflecting continued strong medical cost management in each of our segments. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was 88.4%, a strong result that was in-line with our expectations and long-term target. During the quarter, flu, RSV and COVID related medical costs were minimal. The major medical cost categories were largely in-line with our expectation and normal quarter-to-quarter trend fluctuations. In the quarter, our Medicaid results were burdened with the prior-period premium adjustments. Absent those adjustments, our MCR was at the low-end of our long-term target range. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 88%, also within our long-term target range. During the quarter, we saw sharply lower flu and a continuing decline of COVID related costs, somewhat offset by the impact from continued growth in our D-SNP and MAPD products. In Marketplace, our reported MCR was 68.6%. This strong result reflects our pricing strategy to return this business to target margins, as well as seasonal patterns, which favored the first-half of the year. Recall, our pricing strategy increased our premium yield by approximately 9% this year and with approximately three quarters of our book in renewing members and two-thirds [indiscernible] metallic products, our risk scores should be optimally valued. We feel well-positioned to achieve our Mid-single digit target margins in this business for the year. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7.2% which includes new business implementation spending ahead of the new contract wins, incepting in July and next year. Turning now to our balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. We harvested $100 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter and our quarter-end parent company cash balance was $283 million. Debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged and just 1.7 times trailing 12 months EBITDA with debt to cap ratio at 42.3%. Net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.5 times and 39.3%, respectively, reflecting our low leverage position and ample cash and capital capacity for additional growth and investments. Turning to reserves, our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and we continue to be confident in the strength of our reserve position. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was one day higher sequentially at 48 days of medical cost expense. Prior year development was favorable in the quarter demonstrating the integrity of our actuarial and reserving practices. I would note that the reported favorable prior year development, includes the release of margins on the prior year reserves, which is reestablished in the current quarter. And remaining P&L impact was largely absorbed by prior year minimum MLRs and experienced rebates. Finally, a few comments on guidance. We increased our 2023 adjusted earnings guidance by $0.50 to at least $20.25 per share. This increase is driven by first-quarter performance above our expectations. Partially offset by additional new store implementation costs for our recently-announced Indiana LTSS win and some general early in the year conservativism. We projected a little more than half of this year's earnings in the first two quarters. As Joe mentioned, our new-store embedded earnings in 2023 is now expected to be $4.50 per share comprised of two components: $4 per share, up from previously reported $3.50 for our recent new contract wins in California, Iowa, Nebraska and now including our new Indiana LTSS contract, plus $0.50 per share for the AgeWell and My Choice Wisconsin acquisitions achieving their full run-rate accretion. We continue to carry approximately $2 per share for COVID era risk corridors, providing additional potential upside to the $4.50 of new-store embedded earnings. Within our guidance, our outlook on the resumption of redeterminations and the impact on our business is unchanged. Through March closing, we estimate we gained approximately 800,000 members organically since the start of the pandemic. We continue to expect to retain roughly half of the members gained. We expect the premium impact to be approximately $1.6 billion and that portfolio average margins the earnings impact to be approximately $1 per share. Due to the timing of when members dis-enrolled, we are projecting one-third of the premium and earnings impact to emerge in 2023 with the remainder mostly in 2024. Given that redetermination and disenrollment have just begun on April 1st in only one of our markets, we are unable to share additional data driven insights. However, we remain comfortable with our outlook on margins as we expect numerous items to minimize any potential trend impact from redetermination. First, as discussed in past quarters, our internal membership cohort analysis indicates limited acuity shift potential from several perspectives. Second, the mix effect of impacted membership cohorts dampens the impact. To be clear, redetermination likely effects lower PMPM members. So any cost pressure would be muted by the weighted average of continuing higher premium PMPM members. Third, the gradual rate of dis enrollment over the course of 2023 into 2024 dilutes any ultimate impact ahead of normal rate cycle adjustments. Fourth, the remaining COVID era risk corridors and pre-existing experienced rebate mechanisms as minimum MLR's in many states provides a cushion to absorb potential adverse trend development should it emerge. And finally, rate adjustments, both on-cycle and off-cycle prospective or retrospective will countering emerging trends as states honor their commitments for actuarially sound rates. In summary, we are very pleased with our first-quarter performance in each of our segments and our increased full-year earnings guidance. We look forward to sharing more about our growth strategy and compelling value creation story at our May 15th Investor Day. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Great, thanks for the questions, Josh. I'll take the second one first. The states have a lot of different protocols and policies about how we can interact with members ahead of redetermination. The good news is, they're giving us the list of at risk members months ahead of time, which is very helpful to reach-out to them, interact with them, see if we can re-verify them or in many cases, put them into our Marketplace product if appropriate. Now in the cases where members are being redetermined, they lose their eligibility, which we're estimating is about 50%. I don't know that I had great insights on specifically where they'll go. And Josh, it's complicated, because what we see is some will get re-verified, lose eligibility and move right into another product, others may go uninsured for a few months and then eventually wind-up in one of those products. So I don't have good estimates on that. The only other thing I'll remind you of is, we didn't put any upside on retaining redetermined members in our Marketplace outlook. So anything that we pick up through redetermination is upside to our Marketplace outlook. You bet. And just to put a point on what Joe said, Stephen, maybe what you're reacting to is some of the at-risk member data points. The states are putting those out specifically so that managed care organizations can reach out to those members and whether its eligibility issues or verification issues, interact with those members to minimize it. So the list of at-risk is certainly bigger than the list of folks that will actually lose eligibility. Yes, that's exactly right, Joe. The things to think about there is the investable balance will decline over the year from where it is and about $8.2 billion right now. It will decline as we pay down previous year corridors, minimum MLRs, things like that. Second, we're mostly in cash, which means we're instantly responsive to any cuts in rates. And when I look at the Fed funds outlook, most folks are baking in maybe another raise in the second quarter, but likely two cuts in the back half of the year. So we are cautious in our outlook. And Michael, it's Mark. Let me just take the first question on Medicaid, not sure what your model was, but the Medicaid revenue for me came in right about on expectation. But there's things that can move it a little up, a little down quarter-to-quarter, which might be driving some of what you're seeing. Certainly, mix changes quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year. Retro premiums, which are driven by a number of different items, retro membership updates, things like that certainly drive variations in revenues. And don't forget when we book corridors, minimum MLRs or any form of experience rebates, those run through the revenue line as well. So you put those things together, my hunch is, that's what explains what you're seeing. But overall, I think we're pretty close to just out everybody's model on first quarter. Absolutely. So we started one state in April, but the vast majority of my states won't actually go through eligibility and redetermination until June and July. So, we're fairly back-end loaded here, which is why we're a little limited on data just at the moment. We've got one state. But as Joe mentioned, the way this works is long before a member would actually get redetermined or lose eligibility, they go on in at-risk list. And the states define at-risk in two ways. One, places where they have some data that suggests the member will lose eligibility, some data point that suggests that or just verification failures where they can't reach that number. They're giving us those lists months in advance. So I'm mostly back ended for June and July. But in many cases, I have a list of those members already. We can start reaching out to them, contacting them through all of our different channels long in advance. Now that data is not particularly helpful on what will happen because the whole point of that data is to preempt some of the people that shouldn't lose coverage. So, it's very helpful on us retaining members, but it's not helpful in saying from a data perspective, how many will we lose or what would the economic impact be, if any? Now the real data points on real stairs and levers don't happen until redetermination actually occurs. And again, for us, that's just one state so far. The states published files 834s, 820s, which let us know specifically who's coming and going, who the stairs and levers are. And we're way too early to have real insights on that given one state so far. Absolutely. I mentioned that the majority of our states don't actually redetermine members. That is, take members off the roles until June and July. So we, across our 18 Medicaid states are very back-end loaded. That means the true data development won't really start to accrue until Q3 and Q4. Now remember, these states have a year to go through this process. Some will move a little faster, some will move a little bit slower. But picture on a weighted average going down over time, this data will start to develop, and I think we'll have a meaningful discussion in Q3 and Q4 on real data-driven insights. Hi, Calvin, it's Mark. Joe got it exactly right. The majority of our states, the calendar year is the same as the fiscal year. Which means, if data is developing in the third and fourth quarters it positions you very well for an on-cycle rate review. Now at least two of our states have already committed to a mid-cycle rate review as well, anticipating that at least we should look at the data together. So we feel good about that. Overall, I think on the topic of retrospective and prospective, states have been really open to both. And in many cases, I think they're waiting for the initial gimps of data to decide on-cycle, off-cycle, retrospective, prospective, how they might do that. But the general signal from the states is very much of a partnership here to work through this rate cycle. Yes. Hi, Sarah. On your about timing, don't forget the states have 12 months from the end of the PHE to complete redetermination, the PHE ends in May. So even though some states began redetermination in April, the clock starts ticking as of May. So 12 months from May, I think there may be a difference between states intentions of how fast they move versus how fast they actually move. And we're seeing a little bit of that in some of our partnership discussions with them. So we'll obviously be accommodative of any schedule they want to roll out. But staffing issues, resource issues, it will be interesting to see how the next 13 months here play out. Right. On inpatient, I hear you on the data points, but we're seeing just something just a little bit different. Lower surgical and obviously, lower COVID as the effects of the pandemic are diminishing, but also increasingly outpatient type of care for COVID cases. So as Joe mentioned, a fairly light trend for the first quarter. The only thing I'd add to that is, with risk adjustment, the correlation between medical cost experience and risk adjustment at this point is pretty tight. So if the risk pool changes a little bit, I'm expecting effectively a hedge from our performance on risk adjustment."

            "name": "Joe Zubretsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe, and good morning. Today, we will provide updates on our financial results for the first quarter 2023, our full year 2023 guidance in the context of our first quarter results and our growth initiatives and our strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Let me start with the first quarter highlights. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of $5.81 or 19% year-over-year growth. Total premium revenues at $7.9 billion were as expected, representing a 5% increase over the prior year. Our 87.1% consolidated MCR in the first quarter demonstrates continued strong operating performance. We produced a 5.5% adjusted pretax margin, 4.1% after-tax, a very strong result that is above the high-end of our long-term target range. In the first quarter, we continued to generate excellent margins in our Medicaid business with a medical care ratio of 88.4%. This result was in line with our guidance and long-term target range. Our portfolio of 19 state contracts in 2023 growing to 21 states in 2024, provides earnings [balanced] (ph) and diversification related to rate setting and contract reprocurements. Actuarially sound rates prevail, as the rate-setting process continues to capture a credible medical cost baseline with forward trend and benefit changes and core medical cost trends remained stable and well-controlled. In Medicare, our reported MCR was 88%, which is at the high-end of our long-term target range as a result of driving growth into high acuity low-income consumer segment. In Marketplace, we ended the quarter with 271,000 members. Our Marketplace business is appropriately sized in the overall portfolio, given the inherent volatility of that risk pool. Our first quarter Marketplace MCR was 68.6%, significantly below full year expectations even when considering seasonal patterns. This result reflects the successful implementation of our pricing, metallic mix and membership continuity strategy to restore this business to mid-single digit target margins. In summary, 2023 is off to a very strong start. Medicaid, our flagship business representing over 80% of revenue continues to produce strong predictable operating results and cash flows. Our high acuity Medicare niche serving low income members continues to grow organically and Marketplace is now well positioned to achieve target margins in 2023. Turning now to our 2023 guidance. Based on our strong start to the year, we are increasing our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance to no less than $20.25 or 30% growth year-over-year, even after absorbing $0.75 of one-time implementation costs for new contract wins. We have deliberately reframed from increasing our guidance beyond the first quarter outperformance as we continue to apply appropriate conservatism to our forecast. We believe this conservative discipline is appropriate for several reasons. First, we would not project our significant first quarter Marketplace outperformance to be repeated for the balance of the year. Second, we are not forecasting short-term interest rates to remain at their current levels. Third, as a general matter at this early-stage in the year, it is prudent to anticipate potential medical cost variations. And fourth, and lastly, we do not believe the acuity shift due to redeterminations will have a significant net margin impact, but there is the potential for some sporadic and isolated shifts in acuity. If that were to be the case, there are significant mitigants to any potential impact. These mitigants include a commensurate mix effect premium benefit, experienced rebate and minimum MLR offsets in certain states, and of course, actuarially sound rate adjustments, both retrospective and prospective. That being said, we believe that any potential shift in Medicaid member acuity that could increase medical costs for 2023 is captured in our 88.5% Medicaid MCR guidance for the year. Turning now to an update on our strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Building on our momentum from last year, we are off to a strong start in 2023. At the end of January, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission posted its intent to award our Texas Health Plan, a contract for all our existing eight service areas in the state. Given the continuity of coverage in these service areas and strong brand loyalty, we expect to see continued market share gains and revenue upside in Texas. In March, we announced that our Indiana Health plan was awarded a four year contract to provide managed long-term services and supports. We believe this contract will commence in mid-2024. As one of four managed care organizations in the program, we expect to serve approximately 33,000 members, resulting in annual premium revenue of approximately $1 billion. With the addition of the Indiana LTSS win, our five recent state RFP wins driving within $5 billion in incremental revenue, with a portion included in our 2023 guidance, but most emerging in our 2024 outlook and achieving full run rate in 2025. Based on known building blocks, we now have line of sight to $36 billion of premium revenue in 2024 or 13% growth before additional strategic initiatives. Our new store embedded earnings are now $4.50 per share, providing meaningful visibility into our future earnings growth potential. We see an additional $2 per share of embedded earnings upside if and when the several remaining COVID era corridors are eliminated. Our acquisition pipeline remains replete with actionable opportunities. While the timing of transactions remains inherently difficult to predict, the strength of our pipeline and our track record of success give us confidence in our ability to drive further growth from this important element of our growth strategy. The company's performance continues to validate our long-term strategy, and its value creation potential. Our strategy is sound and it's working. We are delivering topline growth, both organically and with accretive acquisitions, while sustaining industry leading margins. Our model is clear and proven. We will grow organically in our existing footprint. We will win new state contracts and sign new acquisitions, building clear visibility to new store revenues and their related embedded earnings. We will harvest the embedded earnings and include them in our guidance as the contracts incept and the acquisitions closed, all while adding yet additional new revenue streams to our forward outlook. I look-forward to sharing more about our future growth plans and longer-term strategy at our Investor Meeting on May 15th. As is our hallmark style, we will provide you with our detailed playbook for achieving our growth targets and maintaining industry-leading margins. We will not only [declare those] (ph) but also show you with transparency and specificity, how we will achieve them. Our May 15th Investor Day session is appropriately titled, sustaining profitable growth, the next wave. With that I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark? Stephen, our analysis is bottoms up state-by-state. And of course, we are in active discussions with our state-based customers and helping them manage the 90 million people nationwide and we're going to go through the redetermination process. As Mark had mentioned, many of the states have various protocols and different protocols on how interactive we can be. But we are in very active discussions with our state-based customers. They have given us a list of what they consider at risk members, meaning, members that will likely have to go through a reverification process. And from everything we've learned since this all started months ago and now has only started in one state actually in the month of April, we stand pretty firm that our 800,000 member increase during the pandemic will decrease by 50% and end up at 400,000. Justin, on the MLRs for Medicare, we continue to hold firm on our long-term forecast of between 87% and 88%. And I would just summarize it by saying, the faster we grow, it would push you towards the higher end of that range because the members we yet -- are not yet risk-scored, they're not yet into care management programs. And it takes a while for that a year or two for that MLR to settle back into our target range. So if we're growing nicely, which we are today at greater than 10% a year, it will push the MLR up into the higher end of that range, and we're very comfortable with that. On investment income, sure, short-term interest rates are very high currently. As our guidance suggested, we do not forecast them to remain at this level. I will remind you that half of our investable base is locked in at two to three year duration in short-term bonds. But the other half is entirely floating, it's cash and it's floating at short-term rates. And Mark and his team were, I think, appropriately cautious in projecting those rates to decline for the balance of the year. Nathan, it's Joe. Our strategy is working. The strategy to reallocate capital to businesses that add less inherent volatility like Medicare and Medicaid and to keep this at about 5% of the portfolio keeping it small, 5% of the portfolio, keeping its silver with two-thirds of our members in silver products and keeping it stable, 75% of the members renewing. Not only as is projected toward our target mid-single digit pretax target margins, but probably with less inherent volatility. So we're really pleased with that. The first quarter MCR had some seasonality aspects to it, and we did outperform. I would say that our guidance includes something closer to the bottom end of our long term range of 78% to 80%, perhaps a little lower than that. But particularly that more of the business was bronze than we had projected and bronze has higher deductibles. The seasonality tilt is a little steeper than we originally projected. We're on target for the bottom end of our 78% to 80% long-term target range for the full year. Scott, it's Joe. Yes, there are a variety of factors, regulatory factors that have been introduced in the past number of months that have caused folks in the Medicare Advantage business to think differently about the earnings trajectory. First, let me remind everyone that Medicare is only 15% of our total book. Also remind you that of that Medicare book, half of it are the MMP demonstrations. Now while MMP demonstrations aren't totally insulated from these industry dynamics, they do not have STARS scores. They're not subject to the rate notice, although rates come in a different way, 40% of that revenue is actually Medicaid driven and not Medicare-driven. So I wouldn't say we're insulated from it, but with half the book being in MMP, which is not responsive to those various rate type actions. We're pretty well insulated. But it does relate to our D-SNP book. We believe that our product is competitive. It is replete with value-added benefits. Many of these factors affected the entire market. So, if we have to pull back on value-added benefits to keep the product at zero premium and competitive, we think we can do so. I think we're well positioned for a couple of other good years in Medicare. I'm going to take the second part of the question first and kick it to Mark for the analysis of Medicaid revenue. No, we know very little more than we knew at the fourth quarter. Only one state has actually started the redetermination process, and it's a very small state for us. Now we believe that our cohort analysis, which analyzes various aspects of durational acuity, how many members do you have greater than a year or less than a year. How many members do you have that have zero 25% MCR. What's your lapse rate. Didn't go to zero, it decreased, but members were terminating during the pandemic. What's your coordination of benefits rates. It's up slightly, but not a lot. So the data does not suggest that there's a huge shift of members, durational acuity members, and we start there. Second, all we did was mention the mitigants that if something should occur somewhere in one of our markets. There's premium adjustments, premium mix will help us if we're deep into a rebate mechanism or a minimum MLR in that market, that will be the first cushion for a potential effect. And then, of course, you're into the rate cycle. And we believe -- not we believe, we know that the state and CMS have been in active discussions about what could potentially happen and they are not only amenable, but they're very supportive of potential retrospective or prospective rate actions. So that's our point of view. It really hasn't changed from the fourth quarter because we know very little more today than we do at that point. Sure. I'll send to Mark. But for the most part, what we're getting from states is what we're calling members at risk, members that will have to go through some form of process, either specifically or on an [indiscernible] basis to be redetermined. Mark, you're closer to the situation. Yes. Just because the member has been identified as someone who will have to go through the reeligibility process. And by the way, that data is very immature. It's not in hundreds of thousands of members. It's tens of thousands of members. We can extrapolate very little from that. And so, it's way too early to make -- draw any conclusions from the early at-risk member data that we've seen. It will build over time. And as we have insights and we report quarters, we'll fill you in on where we are. A.J., I'll answer the second first. We talked about risk-sharing corridors during the pandemic that were introduced in a dozen of our states as a direct result of the pandemic. Reminding everyone that pre-pandemic, dating all the way back to earlier in the decade, various types of mechanisms existed in 17 of our states, MLR floors experience rebates. Those have always been in place. And because of our performance, we routinely pay into them. The better you perform, the more you'll pay into them. And the more you pay into them, the greater the cushion should your fortunes reverse later in the year. So we're not going to go through the actual numbers because it actually matters where you're in the money, in what state and it's way too difficult to project anything other than we have routinely paid into these mechanisms, the experience rebates, we did last year in 2022 because we were very profitable. Reminding you, we still have best-in-class industry margins even after having paid into them. And yes, should an inflection occur later in the year for whatever reason, redetermination for any other reason, these payables act as the first cushion to financial performance. Mark, do you want to take the question about what quarter we'll have visibility? We've talked about that a lot. And it's might be third, more likely fourth. Sarah, I'll answer the last question first, and Mark and I will tag team the question on timing. With respect to bronze, we've limited bronze to four markets, three markets require us to sell it. In Florida, we actually want to sell it because it's a bronze market, and it's very profitable. We sold more in Florida this year, which accounts for most of the -- the shift to bronze wasn't significant, but it was entirely accounted for our Florida sales efforts, and it's very profitable in Florida. It does add to the seasonality tilt since Bronze has higher deductibles. But we're very comfortable on the profitability of the bronze book because most of the states where we actually want to sell and try to sell. Mark, on the other question? I'll give you the editorial comment. We have not projected it to take longer than we said originally. But I expect that it would. And states are going to be -- most states will be very careful to make sure they don't strain members without coverage if they're in fact eligible. We're not projecting it to take longer, but it could be more back-end loaded than we have projected. Steven, our medical cost trends were completely in line with expectations, flat in Medicaid, 2% in Medicare, 3% in Marketplace year-over-year. We saw an increase in utilization, but it's important to note when we say that to make the companion statement that expensive inpatient stays were down but less expensive. Our outpatient services, ambulatory services were up. So [indiscernible] were up, but the intensity of service and the types of services really reduce unit costs. Our trends were completely in line. We saw nothing in the quarter that wasn't expected or anticipated, trends are completely in line with what we assumed in pricing. COVID has gone from almost being completely and inpatient phenomenon to almost completely a laboratory phenomenon. You trade one inpatient -- the cost of one inpatient stay for one lab test all the time. So it has changed dramatically year-over-year, some pandemic-related and some just trend-related. Gary, our fast start to the year and the exchanges at 68.6% gives us great comfort that we'll operate at or below the low end of our long-term target range of 78% to 80% on the MCR. A little bit more seasonality due to the heavier than expected bronze mix, but completely in line with expectations. We are on target to hit our mid-single digit margin target for the year. With respect to the risk pool, the risk pool has really stabilized. A lot of the irresponsible pricing is out of the market. We have our arms around special enrollment. It's coming in at much lower levels due to the cutoff at 150% of FPL. So we have our arms around that. The risk pool has somewhat stabilized, which gives us really good visibility, not only into the acuity of our members, given that 75% of them are renewed members, but also two-thirds of them are in a silver product, which gives us the opportunity to optimize the value of a risk floor. We're in good shape on the marketplace so far, and we expect to operate at the low end of our long-term target range for the full year. Yes. Given where we performed -- I'm sorry, we couldn't hear the first part of your, you're referring to Medicaid, correct? Thank you. Yes. As I said, 17 of our states have always for a long period of time had mechanisms, experienced rebate mechanisms and minimum MLR mechanisms, which are set at pretty low levels, which allow you to actually earn excellent margins as we have been even though we still have been paying into these mechanisms. So yes, as I mentioned, last year, we had a good year and paid into them. And in the first quarter, again, good first quarter. We also paid into them in the first quarter. We don't disclose how much, but it's a routine part of the business. It's part of the overall earnings trajectory of how we think about the business and the first quarter was business as usual, excellent margins in Medicaid and still paid into these corridors and rabates."

During the call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2024 guidance, Medicaid redeterminations, expected Medicaid rate adjustments and updates, medical cost initiatives and our projected MCR, our recent RFP awards and pending RFP submissions, our acquisitions and M&A activity, revenue growth related to RFPs and M&A activity, our long-term growth strategy, our 2025 marketplace pricing, and our embedded earnings power and future earnings realization. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our foreign 10-K annual report filed with the SEC, as well as our risk factors listed in our form 10-Q and form 8-K filings with the SEC. After completion of our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe?\nJoe Zubretsky: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Today, we will provide you with updates on our reported financial results for the third quarter, highlighted by $6.01 of earnings per share, which was in line with our expectations. An update on our full year 2024 guidance, which we reaffirm at $38 billion of premium revenue and at least $23.50 in earnings per share, and our growth initiatives and strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Let me start with our third quarter performance. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.01, a $9.7 billion of premium revenue. Our 89.2% consolidated MCR was higher than expected as we experienced some medical cost pressure in our Medicaid and Medicare segments. However, we still produced a 4.5% adjusted pre-tax margin or 3.4% after tax, a very strong result. Year to-date, our consolidated MCR is 88.8%, slightly above our long-term target range, and our adjusted pre-tax margin is 4.5%, which is within our long-term target range. Together, these results reflect a well-balanced and well-performing portfolio of businesses. In Medicaid, the business produced a third quarter MCR of 90.5%, above our long-term target range. This result included a premium rate reduction in our California business that was retroactive to the beginning of the year. We are working with the state to understand its methodology and actuarial support for this adjustment, both of which remain unclear. Excluding this retroactive item, the third quarter Medicaid MCR was 90%. The quarter reflects higher than expected medical costs, elevated by the impact of redetermination related to acuity shifts and higher utilization among our continuing population, particularly for LTSS, pharmacy, and behavioral health services. However, this higher trend continued to be partially offset by three dynamics. First, our new store additions continue to improve toward target margins. Second, on-cycle and off-cycle rate adjustments went into effect during the quarter. And finally, our risk corridors continue to act as a financial buffer against elevated medical cost trend. The short-term disparity between rates and medical cost trend may have reached its widest point in the third quarter. We expect this short-term disparity to narrow, starting with known rate updates. In the third quarter, we received five on-cycle rate updates that averaged 4.5%. We also received several positive off-cycle rate adjustments, which is an important indication that many of our states have recognized that certain aspects of their program are underfunded. For the fourth quarter, we received three on-cycle rate updates that averaged 9%. In total, the second half of 2024 now reflects these known rate increases that amount to a benefit of approximately $350 million, or 230 basis points on the Medicaid MCR. This 230 basis point benefit, along with risk corridor protection, is expected to substantially offset the elevated cost trend in the second half of 2024. Looking forward to 2025, the progression of rates and cost trend is not entirely clear. 55% of our Medicaid premium renews on January 1st, and we are encouraged by the draft rates we have seen from several of these states. These draft rates are an important starting point for 2025, and we remain cautiously optimistic while we wait to see how medical cost trend progresses in the fourth quarter and early 2025. Given the confluence of the many MCR dynamics concentrated in the quarter, we are very pleased to be operating at a 90% Medicaid MCR for the full year, nearly 100 basis points above the top end of our long-term range. With the assumption that rates may continue to improve in appropriately captured cost trend in this upcoming rate cycle, there is line of sight to be operating within our long-term MCR target range for 2025. Turning to Medicare, our third quarter MCR was 89.6%, above our long-term target range. The medical cost pressure in the quarter was consistent with the elevated LTSS and pharmacy costs we experienced through the first half of the year, while we also experienced higher outpatient utilization in the third quarter. Our bright business in California performed in line with expectations. In marketplace, the third quarter MCR was 73%. The business continued to perform better than our expectations, even with the higher special enrollment period membership gained from redeterminations this year. Our third quarter adjusted G&A ratio of 6.4% was a very strong result and reflects effective operating discipline, including labor cost management, one-time credits related to vendor contracts, and leveraging our fixed cost base as we grow. Turning now to our guidance for the full year. Our full year premium revenue remains unchanged at approximately $38 billion, or 17% year-over-year growth. We maintain our full year adjusted EPS guidance of at least $23.50, representing 13% year-over-year growth. We expect continued strong performance in our marketplace segment, G&A efficiencies, and higher net investment income to offset the higher MCRs we are experiencing in Medicaid and Medicare. Our 2024 revenue and earnings per share guidance provide a strong foundation for profitable growth in 2025 and beyond, and the building blocks to achieve our long-term growth targets remain intact. Now, some comments on our growth initiatives. Our business is well-positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities in all three segments. In traditional Medicaid, as previously reported, we retained our presence in Florida with a contract to serve approximately 90,000 members in Miami-Dade County. This contract recovery is an important component of our portfolio, given the state of Florida's significant Medicare and marketplace profile. In Georgia, we await the announcement of statewide contract awards. We remain confident in the strength of our proposal and our ability to serve as strong state partners for these populations. We had significant wins in the quarter in our dual-eligible integrated product businesses, which are a major strategic focus for us. In Michigan, we were awarded a contract to provide benefits to the state's highly integrated dual-eligible special needs population in six service regions, including Detroit. This is an increase from our current MMP footprint of two service regions. This win facilitates the transition of our existing MMP members to a high-d product and ensures a new dual-eligible growth opportunity. We project $1 billion of incremental premium revenue by 2027 and have added $0.50 per share to our embedded earnings. The contract, which is effective January 1st, 2026 in select regions, will be implemented statewide in 2027 and continue for seven years. Given our success in this Michigan MMP transition, we are confident about our prospects in both Ohio and Illinois. In Massachusetts, the Commonwealth awarded us a new contract to operate the One Care Under 65 program and retain our position in the Senior Care Options Program for 2026. Incremental revenue is expected to reach nearly $400 million in three years' time, and for this, we have added $0.25 per share to our embedded earnings. Also in Medicare, beginning in 2025, we will no longer offer MAPD products in 13 states, totaling approximately $200 million in annual premium. This adjustment allows us to strategically focus on our dual-eligible populations, where we increased our county footprint by 23% and on our low-income MAPD population in California. Recall the new CMS final rule on integration positions us well as a major Medicaid player. In Marketplace, we are positioned to grow organically in under-penetrated markets, given the stabilized risk profile and margins we've achieved. Our rate filings for 2025 are very competitive and position us to grow in under-penetrated markets. We are confident in our strategy to grow the segment at a rate that allows us to achieve mid-single-digit pre-tax margins. Finally, we continue to expect that our announced acquisition of ConnectiCare will close in the first quarter of 2025. Our ability to grow organically, win new state contracts, and execute M&A are the pillars of our growth strategy, and we fully expect to meet our target of $46 billion of premium revenue in 2026. With our 2024 earnings per share guidance of at least $23.50 reaffirmed, and with our embedded earnings raised to $5.75 per share, we remain on track to deliver long-term profitable growth. Mark will discuss the building blocks of our 2025 outlook in his remarks. In summary, we are pleased with the quarter's results as we continue to power through unprecedented short-term dynamics and just keep executing on the fundamentals. Our businesses remain on solid operational and financial foundations, and are positioned well for long-term profitable growth. We look forward to updating you on the next wave of long-term value creation at our Investor Day event on Friday, November 8th in New York City. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark?\nMark Keim: Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss some additional details in our third quarter performance, the balance sheet, our 2024 guidance, and the building blocks of our 2025 EPS and outlook, beginning with our third quarter results. For the quarter, we reported approximately $10 billion in total revenue and $9.7 billion of premium revenue, with adjusted EPS of $6.01. Our third quarter consolidated MCR of $89.2 was above our expectations, reflecting some pressure we experienced in Medicaid and Medicare during the quarter. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was $90.5. As Joe mentioned, this result includes a 50 basis point increase due to a premium rate reduction in our California business that was retroactive to the beginning of the year. With much of our California revenue in the new store first year of operations stage, corridors were not quite at the target margin levels, so much of the impact of this rate action fell through to our bottom line. We are still working with the state to understand the rationale for this rate adjustment. It's highly unusual for a state to retroactively reduce rates, and all of our other known and expected future rate actions are positive as states address recent medical cost trends. Adjusting for this retroactive item, our reported MCR of $90.5 falls to $90. This was in line with the second quarter and remained elevated versus our expectations, driven primarily by higher than expected medical costs in our legacy Medicaid portfolio. Recall the dynamics of redetermination involve joiners, leavers, and stayers. Redetermination related acuity shifts continued into the third quarter, even as the imbalance of joiners and leavers began to stabilize. We saw a higher utilization among our stayers population, particularly for LTSS, pharmacy, and behavioral health services. Several dynamics served to offset these higher trends in the third quarter and muted the overall impact. First, our new store additions, which represent approximately 20% of Medicaid premium and have a higher than average MCR in their first year, improved during the quarter and remain on track to achieving target margins. Second, we had on cycle and off cycle rate adjustments in 11 states. And finally, due to our strong medical cost management, we started the year deep into risk corridors, which acted as a buffer and created a more muted impact of this acuity shift. Medicaid membership at the end of the third quarter was 4.9 million and in line with the second quarter. Some continuing redeterminations in a few states in July and August were largely offset by the implementation of our New Mexico contract in the quarter. We continue to see reconnects from prior period terminations and expect continuing upside to membership from reconnects in the quarters ahead. In Medicare, our third quarter reported MCR was 89.6. Higher medical costs in the quarter reflected continued higher utilization of LTSS and pharmacy. We also experienced higher outpatient utilization in the third quarter, concentrated in our decent population. Separately, I will note that the prior year risk adjustment true-ups in the second quarter drove a portion of the sequential increase in the MCR. Our bright business in California performed in line with expectations. In Marketplace, our third quarter reported MCR was 73 and better than expected. Special enrollment period membership increased during the quarter, but at a slower rate than the first half of the year. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 6.4 and reflects effective operating discipline, including labor cost management, one-time credits related to vendor contracts and leveraging our fixed cost base as we grow. Turning to the balance sheet, our capital foundation remained strong. In the quarter, we harvested approximately $385 million of subsidiary dividends and our parent company cash balance was approximately $195 million at the end of the quarter. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares. Our full-year guidance now assumes 57.9 million shares outstanding. Debt balances and the debt-to-capital ratio increased slightly in the quarter due to our share repurchases. Debt at the end of the quarter was 1.4 times trailing 12-month EBITDA with our debt-to-cap ratio at about 35%. We continue to have ample cash and capital to fuel our growth initiatives. During the quarter, we also renewed our revolving credit facility for another five years and increased its capacity to 1.25 billion. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 48. We remain confident in the strength of our reserves. Our operating cash flow in the first nine months of 2024 was $868 million. This was lower than the prior year, but consistent with our comments last quarter, reflects the timing of risk corridor payments, CMS receipts, and taxes. Recall that earlier this year we made several large corridor settlements related to prior years. Next, a few comments on our fourth quarter and 2024 guidance. As Joe mentioned, we reaffirm our full-year premium revenue guidance of approximately $38 billion and our full-year EPS guidance of at least $23.50. While full-year EPS guidance is unchanged, the performance in the second half of the year changes the components as compared to our previous guidance. EPS guidance has increased by $2.70 from the combined tailwinds of strong performance in marketplace, G&A efficiencies, and higher net investment income, but will be offset by the higher MCRs in Medicaid and Medicare for a net unchanged view of full-year guidance. We now expect full-year 2024 MCR of 88.7% and G&A ratio of 6.8%. Within Medicaid, we expect fourth quarter MCR of 89%, a decrease from 90.5% in the third quarter. The 150 basis point improvement is driven by three items. First, 50 basis points from the third quarter retroactive premium adjustment in California that will not recur. Next, 80 basis points from known on-cycle and off-cycle rate increases and some benefit of our corridor position will offset trend. Finally, continued improvement in new store additions will contribute 20 basis points. We expect full-year Medicaid MCR of approximately 90, up 70 basis points from our prior guidance, reflecting higher cost trend and approximately 10 basis points for the full-year impact of the third quarter retroactive premium adjustments in California. In Medicare, we expect fourth quarter MCR of 90, an increase from 89.6 in the third quarter. This guidance assumes the third quarter utilization persists for the remainder of the year and increases the full-year MCR to 88.3, a 30 basis point increase from our prior guidance. In Marketplace, we expect fourth quarter MCR of 78.1, compared to 73 in the third quarter. This increase reflects the normal marketplace seasonality during the year and the significant SEP growth we experienced year-to-date. We expect full-year marketplace MCR of 74, down 400 basis points from our prior guidance, reflecting strong year-to-date performance. Turning to embedded earnings and the building blocks of our 2025 EPS outlook. New store embedded earnings are now $5.75, with the addition of contract wins in Michigan and Massachusetts. Both contracts are expected to begin in 2026 and achieve target margins in 2027. We expect to harvest a little less than half of our embedded earnings in 2025. The building blocks include those embedded earnings we expect in 2025, the organic growth and margin in our current footprint, our in-flight organic and strategic initiatives, and the year-over-year benefit of share repurchases executed in the third quarter of 2024. We expect some headwinds from declining interest rates next year. We caution that rates have not yet caught up with trend, and our corridor productions are now lower until replenished by the new cycle of actuarially sound rates. While it is not yet clear how the short-term disparity between rates and trends will progress, these known building blocks are an important foundation to our sustaining long-term profitable growth. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're now ready to take questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. I'd like to ask my second question first. So the strength in marketplace, does that change your view on the impact of potential rebate positions in 2025, just based on what you've seen in the last two years here? And could you just remind us your views? I think you mentioned sort of that mid-single-digit margin, just sort of how you're titrating additional growth in 2025 versus offsetting rebates versus sort of maintaining that mid-single-digit margin?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, Josh, this will be the second straight year of outperformance in marketplace and in '24 into '25, we did invest that excess margin in our bids and expect to grow the business. And yet here we are again with another year of outperformance and we'll continue to do the same. So yes, we're targeting mid-single-digit pre-tax margins, but the business is positioned to grow really well next year and the year after. Now, with respect to the rebate question, recall it's a three-year test and also recall that an 80% minimum is equivalent mark to what? About a 75% GAAP equivalent, correct?\nMark Keim: Right around there. Josh, we're tracking to a 74 in our guidance this year. As Joe mentioned, the 80 nominal that everybody thinks of a minimum MLR is more like a 76-ish. And as Joe mentioned, you can either pay it in a rebate or make it up on volume through pricing and that's the direction we'll take.\nJosh Raskin: Okay, so you guys are in a rebate position. Your point is you can get that 200 basis point delta for next year. And then just a quick follow-up on the Medicaid MLR. I think it's running full year. It looks like 70 basis points higher than your previous. So, maybe if you could just drill down a little bit more on LTSS, behavioral health and RX and what's running specifically worse? What are those incremental pressures coming from?\nJoe Zubretsky: We expected in our initial guidance a trend in Medicaid of about 3% and it's landing at about six. It's split sort of equally between redetermination impact and impact of higher utilization of what I call our continuing membership. No one phenomenon is really driving it. It's a blend of GLP-1s and RX, LTSS both skilled nursing facility in patient stays and hours in home service benefits. And then of course the national phenomenon of behavioral services trending upwards as well. Really no one thing and its different in every geography, but those are the trends we're observing. Mark, anything to add?\nMark Keim: No, I think that's right versus the initial guidance or expectations for the year. We're up about 300 basis points on trend. Joe mentioned its split between rededicuity and its split between stayers running a little bit hotter, BH, LTSS, pharmacy. We're seeing them in pockets here, pockets there but those are national trends.\nJosh Raskin: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from J.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Hi everybody, I think it's AJ but anyway. If your trend is running at about 6% that would imply the rate updates you need to normalize are probably in that range maybe a little bit higher over the next year. That's quite a bit different as you may know from what at least one of your large peers is saying they need, they're talking about a low-to-mid double digit rate increases. And they've also raised the question about whether state budgets can afford to update in one year what's necessary or whether we might need multiple cycles. I guess I don't know if you can comment on why there might be a difference between what you're seeing and what they're seeing, but I'll throw that out and see if I can get you to confirm the order of magnitude of the rate update you need to normalize and whether you think that's achievable over the next year.\nJoe Zubretsky: Let me first, AJ, comment on the model of how we've been describing this since redetermination started. We knew there would be an acuity shift without question. It takes time for a state actuary to observe the acuity shift and allow rates to rate for it. There's a gap there. Being 200 basis points deep into the risk corridors would act as a buffer until rates caught up and that's exactly what's happening here. Obviously we're a bit short, but we're operating comfortably at 90% no matter how you cut it, we're operating comfortably at 90%. Now with respect to rates, what gives us encouragement and great comfort are the rate updates we saw in the second half of the year, $345 million of pre-tax benefit to the second half, 230 basis points in the MCR. Some of those rate updates were off cycle, meaning that states truly have recognized that components of their program were underfunded. The on cycle rate adjustments in the third quarter averaged 4.5%. The on cycle rate adjustments in the fourth quarter averaged nearly 9%. Now we've only seen a handful of draft rates for 1-1 when 55% of our revenue renews but we've been encouraged by what we've seen at this early stage. So how it all maps out depends on what cost trend emerges in the fourth quarter as to whether the strength of those 1-1 rates will truly get us back to our target MCR. Mark, anything to add?\nMark Keim: Joe, I think that's really well summarized. There's no doubt that there's a little bit of a lag between trend and when states recognize it. But as Joe mentioned, five on cycle, seven off in the third quarter, three more in the fourth quarter, the timing will never be perfect but part of our equation here is those corridors make up that difference until we get to the New Year and the new rate cycle. So I think a combination of the states being fairly responsive and the corridor position, we're confident in our outlook.\nA.J. Rice: Okay. That's helpful. Just on your utilization trends that you're seeing, and you called out the areas of Medicaid, it sounds like you're seeing a little bit of that in Medicare. Just trying to parse out, are these just the way the market is at this point or you need to get that in your rate updates both for Medicaid or Medicare or is there medical management opportunities for you to push back on some of what you're seeing?\nJoe Zubretsky: Well, I think it's all relative, right? Because we all get the same rates and we're all observing the same gross trends, supply-driven, demand-driven. We have proven on a sustainable basis that we are managing medical costs effectively. Otherwise, we would not have historically been 200 basis points deep into the corridors on average for the past three or four years. So as rates renew, those corridors replenish and given our expertise in medical management, care management, driving great quality scores, risk adjustment, et cetera, we plan to, and it is our intention to always be operating below whatever state benchmark exists in a minimum MLR or a corridor to always have that financial buffer available to us.\nMark Keim: The only thing I'd add, Joe, is when we talk about trend, we talk about net trend. So the benefit of the medical cost management that we do, UMCM, all that, is already in the numbers that we report. I think maybe when you hear higher trend numbers from other folks, they may have different views on how they do medical management. But again, we talk about net trends, net of all the things we do to manage costs.\nA.J. Rice: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nJoe Zubretsky: Thank you.\nOperator: Apologies to you, Mr. Rice, for misspeaking your name. The next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\nSarah James: Thank you. Can you help us think about what a clean jumping off point for 3Q is? You guys mentioned a one-time vendor credit. How big was that? I think also an unusual tax item. And was any of the 80 basis points pressure on the core Medicaid MLR out of period? And then just a clarification. Is it -- should we think about it as 80 plus the 200 basis points risk corridors, so really 280 year-over-year? That'd be great. Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: We'd have to parse your question into various pieces. But as I said, we are, no matter whether you pro forma the second quarter to the third, the third quarter to the fourth or the full year, we are comfortably operating Medicaid at 90% MCR. In fact, for the full year embedded in our guidance is an 89.3% MCR on the legacy book. That's only 30 basis points above the top end of the range. So we have a bridge, and Mark will give it to you here in a second, how we get from 90.5 in the third to 89 in the fourth, which would then support our guidance. Mark?\nMark Keim: Yes, absolutely. So the jumping off point on the third quarter, we reported a 90.5, but as you know, 50 basis points was that one time I had been in California. So we're jumping off a 90 from a clean basis on a third quarter. When we look at our rates and our trend in our corridors, I'm seeing a pretty significant improvement. I'm targeting an 89 for the fourth quarter. The way I get there off of a 90 is rates. We have three states with known on-cycle rates, which give me 80 bps of good guy for the fourth quarter. I'm going to assume trends another 50 bps in the fourth quarter, and I know I have corridors roughly to offset that. You add a little bit of benefit from our new stores, which continue to give us a 20, 30 bps every quarter as they progress to their targets. That's your trajectory to get from a 90 adjusted to an 89. Now on G&A, you asked also about the jumping off point. We reported a 6.4 in the third quarter. That benefited from some vendor credits, a little bit was retro, but a little bit is sustaining. Just to cut to the chase on that, my full year guidance will be a 6.8 on G&A. I think that gives you the building blocks to model out the rest of the year.\nSarah James: Great, thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: Yes, hi, thanks for the question. I appreciate the color on the bridge to the fourth quarter. So I'm going to follow up a little bit on that. You mentioned some of your factoring and potential for some incremental trend. I guess when you think about the negative impact from acuity shifts that have been driving up, MLR sequentially, rejoiner dynamics presumably contribute into that as well. Is your expectation now given where we are in the cycle that this negative incremental pressure has largely stopped as we enter the third, enter the fourth quarter, or is that factored into your thought process as continuing at least for another quarter or two? Thank you.\nMark Keim: So in the third quarter, we had pretty meaningful trend as did everybody, right? And I think there were two dynamics in the third quarter. One, there was a little more carryover from redetermination. One, it's just the weighted average math. Redetermination mostly stopped in the second quarter, but the weighted average math carrying into the third quarter put a little pressure in the third quarter. The other thing is I had a couple of states that continued to do determinations in the third quarter. I had two states in particular that extended into the third quarter. So we saw a little bit more of the joiners, leavers dynamic into the third quarter than I would have otherwise expected. And of course, the leavers having a little bit higher utilization. I don't think either of those are sustaining, which is why I'm suggesting more like a 50 basis point trend in the fourth quarter over the third, kind of coming back to a new normal.\nOperator: Was there a follow-up, Mr. Baxter?\nStephen Baxter: Yes. Well, I guess I'm going to make a follow-up, I appreciate, just a little bit of like what the states, in terms of the rate update process are really seeing here. I mean, like to follow up on a previous question, we've kind of heard from peer companies that there's often a multi-year lag to the claims base needed to reset rates. So in terms of the rate updates being so large today? Is it truing up acuity factors largely because we've seen enrollment drop off more than what had been previously projected, just trying to understand what is making its way into the rates and why, given that the claims experience obviously is still very dynamic? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: The rate process has not changed. The rate setting process starts with a credible baseline. Every state has a view of where that baseline should lie, whether it's a year prior, two years prior, pre-pandemic trend off the baseline. And acuity shifts, for any reason, are always part of the rating process. The only thing that's different now is that the acuity shift is far more dramatic, given the 92 million enrollees down to 72 million in a short period of time. So nothing's really changed in the rating model process. It works exactly the way it's worked historically. The only thing that's different is the acuity shift is more prominent. And by the way, it's not a secret. I mean, its high profile. Every state knows it, and there's laser focus on it. So the fact that we're getting updates that seem to be capturing it should be no surprise.\nOperator: The next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to focus on your 2025 comments. First, are you confirming that you believe you could do 13% to 15% next year? And specifically, Mark, you gave just about $3 of that embedded earnings kind of comes in next year, which is a great tailwind. On the other hand, you talked about a bunch of help from investment income and G&A and marketplace that might not reoccur. That is almost a similar number. I think you said it was like $2.70. So just trying to think about those moving parts and whether you still see that when combined with core growth, getting you to that 13 to 15 target or where you expect to be in there?\nJoe Zubretsky: Well, I think, Justin, it's Joe, I think the items that are easy to get your arms around are the embedded earnings because we have visibility into them. As Mark said, would there be a headwind from that investment income? That's pretty obvious. The unknown is when we talk about growth off the footprint, that's usually pretty easy to predict. But we need to see how medical cost trend emerges in the fourth quarter into the first to then conclude that the 1-1 rates, 55% of our revenue are appropriately capturing it. So normally, we'd be able to give you a really good point estimate in a normal environment that our footprint should produce a buck, a buck 50, two bucks a share. Right now, we're hesitating to do that until we see more in the fourth quarter. Mark, anything to add?\nMark Keim: Yes, a couple things. Justin, just to set the table, you mentioned $2.70. That was part of my bridging on 2024 guidance. How versus prior guidance, I'm up now $2.70 on a bunch of good guys and down $2.70 on the trend in Medicaid and Medicare. So that's current year. Let's put that aside. For 2025 guidance, Joe hit it exactly right. With some of the vagaries we have right now on trend and rate, we're optimistic, but we're not ready to lay out specific numbers on that. Now, the biggest component of next year is the embedded earnings. As you know, we're now up to $5.75 on embedded earnings. And I said in my prepared remarks, we expect a little less than half of that to emerge next year. Pressures on net investment income, you got that one absolutely. And you're aware we did a small stock repurchase in the third quarter, which you'd want to factor into your numbers as well.\nJustin Lake: Okay, great. And then just to follow up on the rates, it sounded like you got some pretty good retro rates in the quarter. You mentioned that headwind from California, retro cut. Was there any tailwind from some of these rates in the third quarter, especially the off cycle rates being also retroactive that we need to consider in that jump off point or were none of those retro?\nMark Keim: The rates that we got in the third quarter are obviously a good jumping off point going forward. The retro rates are not only retro, but also imply a new go forward basis. So you can jump off third quarter with confidence. And then Joe mentioned we had three new rates in the fourth quarter, which are factored into my fourth quarter outlook.\nJustin Lake: Right Mark. But to the extent they are retro, you would have dollars in the quarter that don't belong in the quarter. Just like California doesn't belong in the cut, right? Was there any of that, like any offset to that 50 bps?\nMark Keim: Just a little bit, just a little bit. But when I give you my bridge from third quarter to fourth quarter, that's in my net rating increase.\nJustin Lake: Okay. Thank you.\nMark Keim: You bet.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Mok with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Mok: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the exchanges. Can you help us understand the drivers of the outperformance in the quarter and how would you compare this year's SEP membership to performance of prior years? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: The SEP membership this year in marketplace has been extraordinary. I think in the second quarter it was 90,000 plus, it leveled off to 60,000 and then 50,000 each of the last three quarters. A normal SEP membership gain in that business is 20,000 to 25,000. So you can see that it benefited by the Medicaid redetermination process without question. Normally that SEP membership comes in with higher acuity and runs higher MCRs. This year the SEP membership came in running higher than the traditional book, but not as high. It's due to a younger demographic, a more healthy demographic, and it didn't put as much pressure on the MCR as it had done historically, likely due to the fact that many of those members came in for Medicaid. So the business is performing well, and I'd rather have excess margin than not, because I can always invest excess margin in growth, which is exactly what we plan to do.\nAndrew Mok: Got it. And if I could just follow up, can you help us understand how the revenue recognition works for off-cycle rate adjustments? Do you wait for those payments to be received or are you able to recognize those when you have a certain level of assurance and visibility into those payments? Thanks.\nMark Keim: Yes, we have a really tight accounting standard on that. We need documented evidence, not just suggestion or conversation. We book on documented evidence.\nAndrew Mok: Great, thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Ron with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAdam Ron: Hey, thanks so much. I have a question about core trend and the difference between what you're seeing on that versus the rate and acuity mismatch. First, has that core trend accelerated throughout the year, such that, 2Q is higher than 1Q, 3Q is higher than 2Q, and you expect 4Q to be higher, and if not, what gives you confidence that it will flow? And then second, if you could just break out the magnitude of how you're seeing core trend versus the acuity rate mismatch and overall how that stacks up? I think one of your competitors said it was roughly a third core trend and two-thirds acuity versus rate. Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: As I said previously, and I'll kick it to Mark, I'll just take Medicaid to keep the conversation simple. We had anticipated a net trend of 3% in our initial guidance. That has increased to 6%, and I guess you could say, yes, it had built during the year. We still have a trend increase going into the fourth. Even off this incredibly high cost baseline, we still, in our forecast, had a slight trend increase into the fourth quarter. The combination of rates, trend, and corridors are the reason we're operating at 90 and not 89. So, it worked exactly the way we had predicted with corridors acting as a buffer until rates caught up. And that is happening. Now, we're still cautious on the 1-1 rates, as I said before, but the model is working exactly as we have predicted. The corridors act as a financial buffer, giving rates time to catch up with trend. Yes, trend did build over the year.\nMark Keim: Yes, and I think, Adam, the easiest way for me to think about it, because you get into timing issues quarter to quarter, what came in when, was something retro, on a full-year basis, as we said before, trend is 3% higher than I initially thought in the outlook, just for all the reasons we all know. Rates are 1.5% better than I initially thought. I'm using 1% of my corridors on a full-year basis to offset some of that mismatch, which is largely why full-year guidance went from 89 to 90. The difference in all that math is obviously you've got a couple of California retro items in there, but those are the big items, and on that trend, what we've been very clear about is part of it is the ongoing imbalance of joiners and leavers, and part of it is those stayers running just a little bit hotter than most of us expected.\nJoe Zubretsky: Yes, and I keep coming back to the legacy book, because the California retro and the new stores create a little bit of obfuscation, but the third quarter legacy book is going to produce an 88.8, the second half is an 89.3 in the full year, legacy book is 89.3. In this incredibly difficult time of a huge shift in the risk pool, we're operating on our legacy book only 30 basis points above the high end of our range, combination of corridor protection, rates catching up to an accelerated trend.\nAdam Ron: Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan Langston with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nRyan Langston: Hi, thank you. You called out higher utilization pharmacy, behavioral LTC. I'm curious if any other service lines might have come in maybe better than you had expected in the 3Q? And then just on the behavioral side, you called out Kentucky last quarter specifically. Is that higher utilization still isolated to that state, or are you now seeing that more maybe broad based on other geographies? Thanks.\nJoe Zubretsky: I'll answer the second question first and kick the first question to Mark. On behavioral, the reason we cited Kentucky, it was a program change that caused it. There is a suspension of utilization management in Kentucky during the pandemic, which of course caused behavioral costs to go up. We are seeing pockets of trend inflection on behavioral services broad based across the country. In Kentucky, it was more pronounced because of the program change. But the stigma over receiving behavioral services is removed. Providers are open for business. They really suffered in terms of service revenue during the pandemic. And of course, the pandemic created all kinds of behavioral issues in the population. So it is a national trend. The reason we called out Kentucky, it was because of a program change.\nMark Keim: And back on the utilization management side, we certainly called attention to some of the challenges. I wouldn't call any specific good guys out. State by state, we're in 21 states. Every state has its own story with some unique items going on here and here. But as a national trend, I wouldn't cite any specific good guys within trend.\nRyan Langston: Okay. Thank you.\nMark Keim: You bet.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Hall with Baird. Please go ahead.\nMichael Hall: All right. Thank you. Something I've been thinking about more and questioning is, I understand D-SNP lives have, I think, a six-month grace period in terms of redetermination. So granted, I think most duly eligible lives aren't actually in the job market. But just give how high revenue PMPMs are, even just a few percent change to drive compressor on MLR. So I'm curious to hear what you've seen on D-SNP redeterminations. Is there potential, excuse me, unexpected tail risk on these lives due to the grace period? And just trying to figure out if there's another potential shoe to drop here.\nJoe Zubretsky: I'm only pausing, Michael, because I'm having difficulty understanding the question. D-SNP lives in our Medicare book and pressure on what aspect of these D-SNP lives are you referring to?\nMichael Ha: Yes. I guess if there's a six-month grace period on D-SNP lives and redetermination, and could that impact your visibility now? Could you see that come through later on? Or maybe am I not thinking about it correctly, if you give visibility onto it and clarity?\nJoe Zubretsky: I can only comment on our D-SNP business. As you know, our Medicare business is performing well. A 4.5% pre-tax margin, we targeted six, 5.5% to six, but in this environment, we're pretty pleased with it. Demonstrations are doing well, D-SNP book is doing well, and as I said, we expanded our county footprint by 23%. We're really focusing on the dual eligible D-SNP population, and of course the Michigan win was huge. We have an MMP book that's going to convert to a fully integrated product here in 2026. So I can only comment that we're very bullish on the D-SNP population, we're focusing intensely on it. The final rule passed by CMS gives players with a substantial Medicaid footprint a huge advantage to take advantage of this great growth opportunity, and it's a profitable book to business for us. We have a proven track record of managing high-acuity lives effectively.\nMichael Hall: Got it. Thank you. If I could follow up, in terms of favorable PYD, it seems like it's been pretty outsized, I think around 700 million this year, if that goes back to normal next year, I think it's about close to 100 bps of just MLR potential headwind into '25. So wondering if you have any color on how or where that could shake out next year, at least directionally, should we be thinking about this as returning to sort of more normal levels in '25?\nMark Keim: Well, Michael, thanks for the question, I'd start with what is normal, right? We are a bigger business in '24 than we were in '23, and yes, my PYD is bigger this year than it was last year, but we're a bigger business, we're getting better and better at things like payment integrity. And as you know, when we acquire businesses that also helps us when we look at prior year and prior period development, so I wouldn't say we're necessarily outsized this year, we're a growing business. Now, on a go-forward business, I'm not expecting any headwind from that area, it's part of the way we run our business. Remember, on medical cost management, there are many components to it, CM, UM, network contracting, payment integrity, and making sure that in retrospect, everything's got settled appropriately, avoiding fraud, waste, and abuse, that's a big part of our business. So I see the PYD item as a very continuing part of a business, and I wouldn't factor in anything meaningfully different next year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. First question, just thought it might be helpful if you can maybe just sort of sequence us or walk us through on the corridors, where you stood at the beginning of the quarter, and then at the end of the quarter, and then where you're expecting to be, I guess, in terms of remaining cushion at the end of the year. Just trying to understand particularly how much potential, I guess, sort of cushion you'll still have from corridors heading into 2025?\nJoe Zubretsky: Sure, Scott, it's Joe. I'm going to make a framing comment and kick it to Mark for some color on the numbers, but the first thing, one of the reasons we usually hesitate to talk about corridors either in dollars or in basis points of cushion is you never know that you're going to be using it in a place where you have it. If you have negative trend experience, if it happens in a place where there's no corridor protection, there's zero protection, and if it happens everywhere we do have protection, it's 100% protected. So averages actually can be misleading, but I will tell you in each of the past four years we've been operating with about 200 basis points of protection at every point in time. Mark?\nMark Keim: Yes, and let me just run through the usual example that we give just to everyone's level set. If business reports an 88 MLR, in our case an analogy might be we were really running an 86. Again, this is just an example, and we were booking 200 basis points of corridor expense. Now, if during that example year the true underlying medical costs went from an 86 to an 87, you might still report the 88, you just would have used more corridor expense, just booked less corridor expense. When the new rate cycle comes around, if rates are actuarially sound, the rates will have to jump enough to essentially put that corridor position back to where it was, all things being equal. So the 86 underlying medical cost goes to an 87, the new rate trend knocks it back to an 86. Right now that is somewhat analogous to the overall enterprise. I started off the year thinking I had about 200 basis points of corridor expense in my MLR. As you know, over the quarters we've started to use that, and I've shown you that in my bridges, such that I'm thinking full year ultimate, that 200 that I normally have is down to more like 100 basis points within my MLR. Now, Joe talked about how 55% of our revenue reprices on January 1. We're optimistic on what that looks like, as well as the rate increases we got in Q3, Q4. So I'm expecting some extent to replenish that corridor. Now, that's all about the rate cycles, and we're not really ready to get into what's what on that. And the last thing, what Joe made, the points Joe made, is even with that 100 basis points of remaining corridor, it's an imperfect hedge, because it depends on where the medical costs come up and where you have the remaining corridors. So there's only so much comfort you can take in that, but it is a very big part of our equation. And again, just to round it out, 200 originally in my guidance, and I've probably used half of it during the course of the year.\nOperator: And the last questioner today will be George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Yes, thanks for squeezing me in, guys. Mark, you might have just gotten us, but I guess, so the expectation is you have 100 basis points of the risk corridor to use in the back half of the year. I guess, can you talk about how much you expect to have by the end? And can you talk about how much was used front half versus back half?\nMark Keim: Okay. So it's best to think about these on a full year basis, because quarter-to-quarter, it gets a little bit more complicated. On a full year basis, I started off the year expecting 200. Across the year, a little bit in Q2, more in Q3, more in Q4, I expect to have used half of it, which means on a full year basis within my reported MLR, I'm expecting about 100 basis points of corridor expense. And again, for the New Year, it's all about the new rate cycle on what happens on resetting that.\nGeorge Hill: Okay, that's helpful. And if I could have a quick follow up, could you just comment on how many states do you guys still have a corridor position in? And what percent of lives are on a multi-year repricing basis? Like, we've spoken to some states where they just say, like, our rate cycle's two years or more than two years. So I know we talk about, like, the annual rate cycle, but there are just some states who don't do this annually. Maybe on a percentage of lives, can you talk about what states are on a multi-year cycle versus a single year cycle?\nMark Keim: Sure. Just about every one of our states has some form of a corridor, a minimum MLR, or a profit sharing. And that's not news. Many of these things have been around for quite some time. What is important is what the numbers are and how that acts. But you have some form of that in just about every state. And if I understood your question right on the pricing cycle, every state that we have reprices on an annual basis, and some of them commit to on a twice-a-year basis to look at the rates. Most years, that's not necessary, but obviously these days, that's an important fact.\nGeorge Hill: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question and answer session and Molina HealthCare's third quarter 2024 earnings call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Keim",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss some additional details in our third quarter performance, the balance sheet, our 2024 guidance, and the building blocks of our 2025 EPS and outlook, beginning with our third quarter results. For the quarter, we reported approximately $10 billion in total revenue and $9.7 billion of premium revenue, with adjusted EPS of $6.01. Our third quarter consolidated MCR of $89.2 was above our expectations, reflecting some pressure we experienced in Medicaid and Medicare during the quarter. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was $90.5. As Joe mentioned, this result includes a 50 basis point increase due to a premium rate reduction in our California business that was retroactive to the beginning of the year. With much of our California revenue in the new store first year of operations stage, corridors were not quite at the target margin levels, so much of the impact of this rate action fell through to our bottom line. We are still working with the state to understand the rationale for this rate adjustment. It's highly unusual for a state to retroactively reduce rates, and all of our other known and expected future rate actions are positive as states address recent medical cost trends. Adjusting for this retroactive item, our reported MCR of $90.5 falls to $90. This was in line with the second quarter and remained elevated versus our expectations, driven primarily by higher than expected medical costs in our legacy Medicaid portfolio. Recall the dynamics of redetermination involve joiners, leavers, and stayers. Redetermination related acuity shifts continued into the third quarter, even as the imbalance of joiners and leavers began to stabilize. We saw a higher utilization among our stayers population, particularly for LTSS, pharmacy, and behavioral health services. Several dynamics served to offset these higher trends in the third quarter and muted the overall impact. First, our new store additions, which represent approximately 20% of Medicaid premium and have a higher than average MCR in their first year, improved during the quarter and remain on track to achieving target margins. Second, we had on cycle and off cycle rate adjustments in 11 states. And finally, due to our strong medical cost management, we started the year deep into risk corridors, which acted as a buffer and created a more muted impact of this acuity shift. Medicaid membership at the end of the third quarter was 4.9 million and in line with the second quarter. Some continuing redeterminations in a few states in July and August were largely offset by the implementation of our New Mexico contract in the quarter. We continue to see reconnects from prior period terminations and expect continuing upside to membership from reconnects in the quarters ahead. In Medicare, our third quarter reported MCR was 89.6. Higher medical costs in the quarter reflected continued higher utilization of LTSS and pharmacy. We also experienced higher outpatient utilization in the third quarter, concentrated in our decent population. Separately, I will note that the prior year risk adjustment true-ups in the second quarter drove a portion of the sequential increase in the MCR. Our bright business in California performed in line with expectations. In Marketplace, our third quarter reported MCR was 73 and better than expected. Special enrollment period membership increased during the quarter, but at a slower rate than the first half of the year. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 6.4 and reflects effective operating discipline, including labor cost management, one-time credits related to vendor contracts and leveraging our fixed cost base as we grow. Turning to the balance sheet, our capital foundation remained strong. In the quarter, we harvested approximately $385 million of subsidiary dividends and our parent company cash balance was approximately $195 million at the end of the quarter. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares. Our full-year guidance now assumes 57.9 million shares outstanding. Debt balances and the debt-to-capital ratio increased slightly in the quarter due to our share repurchases. Debt at the end of the quarter was 1.4 times trailing 12-month EBITDA with our debt-to-cap ratio at about 35%. We continue to have ample cash and capital to fuel our growth initiatives. During the quarter, we also renewed our revolving credit facility for another five years and increased its capacity to 1.25 billion. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 48. We remain confident in the strength of our reserves. Our operating cash flow in the first nine months of 2024 was $868 million. This was lower than the prior year, but consistent with our comments last quarter, reflects the timing of risk corridor payments, CMS receipts, and taxes. Recall that earlier this year we made several large corridor settlements related to prior years. Next, a few comments on our fourth quarter and 2024 guidance. As Joe mentioned, we reaffirm our full-year premium revenue guidance of approximately $38 billion and our full-year EPS guidance of at least $23.50. While full-year EPS guidance is unchanged, the performance in the second half of the year changes the components as compared to our previous guidance. EPS guidance has increased by $2.70 from the combined tailwinds of strong performance in marketplace, G&A efficiencies, and higher net investment income, but will be offset by the higher MCRs in Medicaid and Medicare for a net unchanged view of full-year guidance. We now expect full-year 2024 MCR of 88.7% and G&A ratio of 6.8%. Within Medicaid, we expect fourth quarter MCR of 89%, a decrease from 90.5% in the third quarter. The 150 basis point improvement is driven by three items. First, 50 basis points from the third quarter retroactive premium adjustment in California that will not recur. Next, 80 basis points from known on-cycle and off-cycle rate increases and some benefit of our corridor position will offset trend. Finally, continued improvement in new store additions will contribute 20 basis points. We expect full-year Medicaid MCR of approximately 90, up 70 basis points from our prior guidance, reflecting higher cost trend and approximately 10 basis points for the full-year impact of the third quarter retroactive premium adjustments in California. In Medicare, we expect fourth quarter MCR of 90, an increase from 89.6 in the third quarter. This guidance assumes the third quarter utilization persists for the remainder of the year and increases the full-year MCR to 88.3, a 30 basis point increase from our prior guidance. In Marketplace, we expect fourth quarter MCR of 78.1, compared to 73 in the third quarter. This increase reflects the normal marketplace seasonality during the year and the significant SEP growth we experienced year-to-date. We expect full-year marketplace MCR of 74, down 400 basis points from our prior guidance, reflecting strong year-to-date performance. Turning to embedded earnings and the building blocks of our 2025 EPS outlook. New store embedded earnings are now $5.75, with the addition of contract wins in Michigan and Massachusetts. Both contracts are expected to begin in 2026 and achieve target margins in 2027. We expect to harvest a little less than half of our embedded earnings in 2025. The building blocks include those embedded earnings we expect in 2025, the organic growth and margin in our current footprint, our in-flight organic and strategic initiatives, and the year-over-year benefit of share repurchases executed in the third quarter of 2024. We expect some headwinds from declining interest rates next year. We caution that rates have not yet caught up with trend, and our corridor productions are now lower until replenished by the new cycle of actuarially sound rates. While it is not yet clear how the short-term disparity between rates and trends will progress, these known building blocks are an important foundation to our sustaining long-term profitable growth. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're now ready to take questions. Right around there. Josh, we're tracking to a 74 in our guidance this year. As Joe mentioned, the 80 nominal that everybody thinks of a minimum MLR is more like a 76-ish. And as Joe mentioned, you can either pay it in a rebate or make it up on volume through pricing and that's the direction we'll take. No, I think that's right versus the initial guidance or expectations for the year. We're up about 300 basis points on trend. Joe mentioned its split between rededicuity and its split between stayers running a little bit hotter, BH, LTSS, pharmacy. We're seeing them in pockets here, pockets there but those are national trends. Joe, I think that's really well summarized. There's no doubt that there's a little bit of a lag between trend and when states recognize it. But as Joe mentioned, five on cycle, seven off in the third quarter, three more in the fourth quarter, the timing will never be perfect but part of our equation here is those corridors make up that difference until we get to the New Year and the new rate cycle. So I think a combination of the states being fairly responsive and the corridor position, we're confident in our outlook. The only thing I'd add, Joe, is when we talk about trend, we talk about net trend. So the benefit of the medical cost management that we do, UMCM, all that, is already in the numbers that we report. I think maybe when you hear higher trend numbers from other folks, they may have different views on how they do medical management. But again, we talk about net trends, net of all the things we do to manage costs. Yes, absolutely. So the jumping off point on the third quarter, we reported a 90.5, but as you know, 50 basis points was that one time I had been in California. So we're jumping off a 90 from a clean basis on a third quarter. When we look at our rates and our trend in our corridors, I'm seeing a pretty significant improvement. I'm targeting an 89 for the fourth quarter. The way I get there off of a 90 is rates. We have three states with known on-cycle rates, which give me 80 bps of good guy for the fourth quarter. I'm going to assume trends another 50 bps in the fourth quarter, and I know I have corridors roughly to offset that. You add a little bit of benefit from our new stores, which continue to give us a 20, 30 bps every quarter as they progress to their targets. That's your trajectory to get from a 90 adjusted to an 89. Now on G&A, you asked also about the jumping off point. We reported a 6.4 in the third quarter. That benefited from some vendor credits, a little bit was retro, but a little bit is sustaining. Just to cut to the chase on that, my full year guidance will be a 6.8 on G&A. I think that gives you the building blocks to model out the rest of the year. So in the third quarter, we had pretty meaningful trend as did everybody, right? And I think there were two dynamics in the third quarter. One, there was a little more carryover from redetermination. One, it's just the weighted average math. Redetermination mostly stopped in the second quarter, but the weighted average math carrying into the third quarter put a little pressure in the third quarter. The other thing is I had a couple of states that continued to do determinations in the third quarter. I had two states in particular that extended into the third quarter. So we saw a little bit more of the joiners, leavers dynamic into the third quarter than I would have otherwise expected. And of course, the leavers having a little bit higher utilization. I don't think either of those are sustaining, which is why I'm suggesting more like a 50 basis point trend in the fourth quarter over the third, kind of coming back to a new normal. Yes, a couple things. Justin, just to set the table, you mentioned $2.70. That was part of my bridging on 2024 guidance. How versus prior guidance, I'm up now $2.70 on a bunch of good guys and down $2.70 on the trend in Medicaid and Medicare. So that's current year. Let's put that aside. For 2025 guidance, Joe hit it exactly right. With some of the vagaries we have right now on trend and rate, we're optimistic, but we're not ready to lay out specific numbers on that. Now, the biggest component of next year is the embedded earnings. As you know, we're now up to $5.75 on embedded earnings. And I said in my prepared remarks, we expect a little less than half of that to emerge next year. Pressures on net investment income, you got that one absolutely. And you're aware we did a small stock repurchase in the third quarter, which you'd want to factor into your numbers as well. The rates that we got in the third quarter are obviously a good jumping off point going forward. The retro rates are not only retro, but also imply a new go forward basis. So you can jump off third quarter with confidence. And then Joe mentioned we had three new rates in the fourth quarter, which are factored into my fourth quarter outlook. Just a little bit, just a little bit. But when I give you my bridge from third quarter to fourth quarter, that's in my net rating increase. You bet. Yes, we have a really tight accounting standard on that. We need documented evidence, not just suggestion or conversation. We book on documented evidence. Yes, and I think, Adam, the easiest way for me to think about it, because you get into timing issues quarter to quarter, what came in when, was something retro, on a full-year basis, as we said before, trend is 3% higher than I initially thought in the outlook, just for all the reasons we all know. Rates are 1.5% better than I initially thought. I'm using 1% of my corridors on a full-year basis to offset some of that mismatch, which is largely why full-year guidance went from 89 to 90. The difference in all that math is obviously you've got a couple of California retro items in there, but those are the big items, and on that trend, what we've been very clear about is part of it is the ongoing imbalance of joiners and leavers, and part of it is those stayers running just a little bit hotter than most of us expected. And back on the utilization management side, we certainly called attention to some of the challenges. I wouldn't call any specific good guys out. State by state, we're in 21 states. Every state has its own story with some unique items going on here and here. But as a national trend, I wouldn't cite any specific good guys within trend. You bet. Well, Michael, thanks for the question, I'd start with what is normal, right? We are a bigger business in '24 than we were in '23, and yes, my PYD is bigger this year than it was last year, but we're a bigger business, we're getting better and better at things like payment integrity. And as you know, when we acquire businesses that also helps us when we look at prior year and prior period development, so I wouldn't say we're necessarily outsized this year, we're a growing business. Now, on a go-forward business, I'm not expecting any headwind from that area, it's part of the way we run our business. Remember, on medical cost management, there are many components to it, CM, UM, network contracting, payment integrity, and making sure that in retrospect, everything's got settled appropriately, avoiding fraud, waste, and abuse, that's a big part of our business. So I see the PYD item as a very continuing part of a business, and I wouldn't factor in anything meaningfully different next year. Yes, and let me just run through the usual example that we give just to everyone's level set. If business reports an 88 MLR, in our case an analogy might be we were really running an 86. Again, this is just an example, and we were booking 200 basis points of corridor expense. Now, if during that example year the true underlying medical costs went from an 86 to an 87, you might still report the 88, you just would have used more corridor expense, just booked less corridor expense. When the new rate cycle comes around, if rates are actuarially sound, the rates will have to jump enough to essentially put that corridor position back to where it was, all things being equal. So the 86 underlying medical cost goes to an 87, the new rate trend knocks it back to an 86. Right now that is somewhat analogous to the overall enterprise. I started off the year thinking I had about 200 basis points of corridor expense in my MLR. As you know, over the quarters we've started to use that, and I've shown you that in my bridges, such that I'm thinking full year ultimate, that 200 that I normally have is down to more like 100 basis points within my MLR. Now, Joe talked about how 55% of our revenue reprices on January 1. We're optimistic on what that looks like, as well as the rate increases we got in Q3, Q4. So I'm expecting some extent to replenish that corridor. Now, that's all about the rate cycles, and we're not really ready to get into what's what on that. And the last thing, what Joe made, the points Joe made, is even with that 100 basis points of remaining corridor, it's an imperfect hedge, because it depends on where the medical costs come up and where you have the remaining corridors. So there's only so much comfort you can take in that, but it is a very big part of our equation. And again, just to round it out, 200 originally in my guidance, and I've probably used half of it during the course of the year. Okay. So it's best to think about these on a full year basis, because quarter-to-quarter, it gets a little bit more complicated. On a full year basis, I started off the year expecting 200. Across the year, a little bit in Q2, more in Q3, more in Q4, I expect to have used half of it, which means on a full year basis within my reported MLR, I'm expecting about 100 basis points of corridor expense. And again, for the New Year, it's all about the new rate cycle on what happens on resetting that. Sure. Just about every one of our states has some form of a corridor, a minimum MLR, or a profit sharing. And that's not news. Many of these things have been around for quite some time. What is important is what the numbers are and how that acts. But you have some form of that in just about every state. And if I understood your question right on the pricing cycle, every state that we have reprices on an annual basis, and some of them commit to on a twice-a-year basis to look at the rates. Most years, that's not necessary, but obviously these days, that's an important fact."

            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Today, we will provide you with updates on our reported financial results for the third quarter, highlighted by $6.01 of earnings per share, which was in line with our expectations. An update on our full year 2024 guidance, which we reaffirm at $38 billion of premium revenue and at least $23.50 in earnings per share, and our growth initiatives and strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Let me start with our third quarter performance. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.01, a $9.7 billion of premium revenue. Our 89.2% consolidated MCR was higher than expected as we experienced some medical cost pressure in our Medicaid and Medicare segments. However, we still produced a 4.5% adjusted pre-tax margin or 3.4% after tax, a very strong result. Year to-date, our consolidated MCR is 88.8%, slightly above our long-term target range, and our adjusted pre-tax margin is 4.5%, which is within our long-term target range. Together, these results reflect a well-balanced and well-performing portfolio of businesses. In Medicaid, the business produced a third quarter MCR of 90.5%, above our long-term target range. This result included a premium rate reduction in our California business that was retroactive to the beginning of the year. We are working with the state to understand its methodology and actuarial support for this adjustment, both of which remain unclear. Excluding this retroactive item, the third quarter Medicaid MCR was 90%. The quarter reflects higher than expected medical costs, elevated by the impact of redetermination related to acuity shifts and higher utilization among our continuing population, particularly for LTSS, pharmacy, and behavioral health services. However, this higher trend continued to be partially offset by three dynamics. First, our new store additions continue to improve toward target margins. Second, on-cycle and off-cycle rate adjustments went into effect during the quarter. And finally, our risk corridors continue to act as a financial buffer against elevated medical cost trend. The short-term disparity between rates and medical cost trend may have reached its widest point in the third quarter. We expect this short-term disparity to narrow, starting with known rate updates. In the third quarter, we received five on-cycle rate updates that averaged 4.5%. We also received several positive off-cycle rate adjustments, which is an important indication that many of our states have recognized that certain aspects of their program are underfunded. For the fourth quarter, we received three on-cycle rate updates that averaged 9%. In total, the second half of 2024 now reflects these known rate increases that amount to a benefit of approximately $350 million, or 230 basis points on the Medicaid MCR. This 230 basis point benefit, along with risk corridor protection, is expected to substantially offset the elevated cost trend in the second half of 2024. Looking forward to 2025, the progression of rates and cost trend is not entirely clear. 55% of our Medicaid premium renews on January 1st, and we are encouraged by the draft rates we have seen from several of these states. These draft rates are an important starting point for 2025, and we remain cautiously optimistic while we wait to see how medical cost trend progresses in the fourth quarter and early 2025. Given the confluence of the many MCR dynamics concentrated in the quarter, we are very pleased to be operating at a 90% Medicaid MCR for the full year, nearly 100 basis points above the top end of our long-term range. With the assumption that rates may continue to improve in appropriately captured cost trend in this upcoming rate cycle, there is line of sight to be operating within our long-term MCR target range for 2025. Turning to Medicare, our third quarter MCR was 89.6%, above our long-term target range. The medical cost pressure in the quarter was consistent with the elevated LTSS and pharmacy costs we experienced through the first half of the year, while we also experienced higher outpatient utilization in the third quarter. Our bright business in California performed in line with expectations. In marketplace, the third quarter MCR was 73%. The business continued to perform better than our expectations, even with the higher special enrollment period membership gained from redeterminations this year. Our third quarter adjusted G&A ratio of 6.4% was a very strong result and reflects effective operating discipline, including labor cost management, one-time credits related to vendor contracts, and leveraging our fixed cost base as we grow. Turning now to our guidance for the full year. Our full year premium revenue remains unchanged at approximately $38 billion, or 17% year-over-year growth. We maintain our full year adjusted EPS guidance of at least $23.50, representing 13% year-over-year growth. We expect continued strong performance in our marketplace segment, G&A efficiencies, and higher net investment income to offset the higher MCRs we are experiencing in Medicaid and Medicare. Our 2024 revenue and earnings per share guidance provide a strong foundation for profitable growth in 2025 and beyond, and the building blocks to achieve our long-term growth targets remain intact. Now, some comments on our growth initiatives. Our business is well-positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities in all three segments. In traditional Medicaid, as previously reported, we retained our presence in Florida with a contract to serve approximately 90,000 members in Miami-Dade County. This contract recovery is an important component of our portfolio, given the state of Florida's significant Medicare and marketplace profile. In Georgia, we await the announcement of statewide contract awards. We remain confident in the strength of our proposal and our ability to serve as strong state partners for these populations. We had significant wins in the quarter in our dual-eligible integrated product businesses, which are a major strategic focus for us. In Michigan, we were awarded a contract to provide benefits to the state's highly integrated dual-eligible special needs population in six service regions, including Detroit. This is an increase from our current MMP footprint of two service regions. This win facilitates the transition of our existing MMP members to a high-d product and ensures a new dual-eligible growth opportunity. We project $1 billion of incremental premium revenue by 2027 and have added $0.50 per share to our embedded earnings. The contract, which is effective January 1st, 2026 in select regions, will be implemented statewide in 2027 and continue for seven years. Given our success in this Michigan MMP transition, we are confident about our prospects in both Ohio and Illinois. In Massachusetts, the Commonwealth awarded us a new contract to operate the One Care Under 65 program and retain our position in the Senior Care Options Program for 2026. Incremental revenue is expected to reach nearly $400 million in three years' time, and for this, we have added $0.25 per share to our embedded earnings. Also in Medicare, beginning in 2025, we will no longer offer MAPD products in 13 states, totaling approximately $200 million in annual premium. This adjustment allows us to strategically focus on our dual-eligible populations, where we increased our county footprint by 23% and on our low-income MAPD population in California. Recall the new CMS final rule on integration positions us well as a major Medicaid player. In Marketplace, we are positioned to grow organically in under-penetrated markets, given the stabilized risk profile and margins we've achieved. Our rate filings for 2025 are very competitive and position us to grow in under-penetrated markets. We are confident in our strategy to grow the segment at a rate that allows us to achieve mid-single-digit pre-tax margins. Finally, we continue to expect that our announced acquisition of ConnectiCare will close in the first quarter of 2025. Our ability to grow organically, win new state contracts, and execute M&A are the pillars of our growth strategy, and we fully expect to meet our target of $46 billion of premium revenue in 2026. With our 2024 earnings per share guidance of at least $23.50 reaffirmed, and with our embedded earnings raised to $5.75 per share, we remain on track to deliver long-term profitable growth. Mark will discuss the building blocks of our 2025 outlook in his remarks. In summary, we are pleased with the quarter's results as we continue to power through unprecedented short-term dynamics and just keep executing on the fundamentals. Our businesses remain on solid operational and financial foundations, and are positioned well for long-term profitable growth. We look forward to updating you on the next wave of long-term value creation at our Investor Day event on Friday, November 8th in New York City. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark? Sure, Josh, this will be the second straight year of outperformance in marketplace and in '24 into '25, we did invest that excess margin in our bids and expect to grow the business. And yet here we are again with another year of outperformance and we'll continue to do the same. So yes, we're targeting mid-single-digit pre-tax margins, but the business is positioned to grow really well next year and the year after. Now, with respect to the rebate question, recall it's a three-year test and also recall that an 80% minimum is equivalent mark to what? About a 75% GAAP equivalent, correct? We expected in our initial guidance a trend in Medicaid of about 3% and it's landing at about six. It's split sort of equally between redetermination impact and impact of higher utilization of what I call our continuing membership. No one phenomenon is really driving it. It's a blend of GLP-1s and RX, LTSS both skilled nursing facility in patient stays and hours in home service benefits. And then of course the national phenomenon of behavioral services trending upwards as well. Really no one thing and its different in every geography, but those are the trends we're observing. Mark, anything to add? Let me first, AJ, comment on the model of how we've been describing this since redetermination started. We knew there would be an acuity shift without question. It takes time for a state actuary to observe the acuity shift and allow rates to rate for it. There's a gap there. Being 200 basis points deep into the risk corridors would act as a buffer until rates caught up and that's exactly what's happening here. Obviously we're a bit short, but we're operating comfortably at 90% no matter how you cut it, we're operating comfortably at 90%. Now with respect to rates, what gives us encouragement and great comfort are the rate updates we saw in the second half of the year, $345 million of pre-tax benefit to the second half, 230 basis points in the MCR. Some of those rate updates were off cycle, meaning that states truly have recognized that components of their program were underfunded. The on cycle rate adjustments in the third quarter averaged 4.5%. The on cycle rate adjustments in the fourth quarter averaged nearly 9%. Now we've only seen a handful of draft rates for 1-1 when 55% of our revenue renews but we've been encouraged by what we've seen at this early stage. So how it all maps out depends on what cost trend emerges in the fourth quarter as to whether the strength of those 1-1 rates will truly get us back to our target MCR. Mark, anything to add? Well, I think it's all relative, right? Because we all get the same rates and we're all observing the same gross trends, supply-driven, demand-driven. We have proven on a sustainable basis that we are managing medical costs effectively. Otherwise, we would not have historically been 200 basis points deep into the corridors on average for the past three or four years. So as rates renew, those corridors replenish and given our expertise in medical management, care management, driving great quality scores, risk adjustment, et cetera, we plan to, and it is our intention to always be operating below whatever state benchmark exists in a minimum MLR or a corridor to always have that financial buffer available to us. Thank you. We'd have to parse your question into various pieces. But as I said, we are, no matter whether you pro forma the second quarter to the third, the third quarter to the fourth or the full year, we are comfortably operating Medicaid at 90% MCR. In fact, for the full year embedded in our guidance is an 89.3% MCR on the legacy book. That's only 30 basis points above the top end of the range. So we have a bridge, and Mark will give it to you here in a second, how we get from 90.5 in the third to 89 in the fourth, which would then support our guidance. Mark? The rate process has not changed. The rate setting process starts with a credible baseline. Every state has a view of where that baseline should lie, whether it's a year prior, two years prior, pre-pandemic trend off the baseline. And acuity shifts, for any reason, are always part of the rating process. The only thing that's different now is that the acuity shift is far more dramatic, given the 92 million enrollees down to 72 million in a short period of time. So nothing's really changed in the rating model process. It works exactly the way it's worked historically. The only thing that's different is the acuity shift is more prominent. And by the way, it's not a secret. I mean, its high profile. Every state knows it, and there's laser focus on it. So the fact that we're getting updates that seem to be capturing it should be no surprise. Well, I think, Justin, it's Joe, I think the items that are easy to get your arms around are the embedded earnings because we have visibility into them. As Mark said, would there be a headwind from that investment income? That's pretty obvious. The unknown is when we talk about growth off the footprint, that's usually pretty easy to predict. But we need to see how medical cost trend emerges in the fourth quarter into the first to then conclude that the 1-1 rates, 55% of our revenue are appropriately capturing it. So normally, we'd be able to give you a really good point estimate in a normal environment that our footprint should produce a buck, a buck 50, two bucks a share. Right now, we're hesitating to do that until we see more in the fourth quarter. Mark, anything to add? The SEP membership this year in marketplace has been extraordinary. I think in the second quarter it was 90,000 plus, it leveled off to 60,000 and then 50,000 each of the last three quarters. A normal SEP membership gain in that business is 20,000 to 25,000. So you can see that it benefited by the Medicaid redetermination process without question. Normally that SEP membership comes in with higher acuity and runs higher MCRs. This year the SEP membership came in running higher than the traditional book, but not as high. It's due to a younger demographic, a more healthy demographic, and it didn't put as much pressure on the MCR as it had done historically, likely due to the fact that many of those members came in for Medicaid. So the business is performing well, and I'd rather have excess margin than not, because I can always invest excess margin in growth, which is exactly what we plan to do. As I said previously, and I'll kick it to Mark, I'll just take Medicaid to keep the conversation simple. We had anticipated a net trend of 3% in our initial guidance. That has increased to 6%, and I guess you could say, yes, it had built during the year. We still have a trend increase going into the fourth. Even off this incredibly high cost baseline, we still, in our forecast, had a slight trend increase into the fourth quarter. The combination of rates, trend, and corridors are the reason we're operating at 90 and not 89. So, it worked exactly the way we had predicted with corridors acting as a buffer until rates caught up. And that is happening. Now, we're still cautious on the 1-1 rates, as I said before, but the model is working exactly as we have predicted. The corridors act as a financial buffer, giving rates time to catch up with trend. Yes, trend did build over the year. Yes, and I keep coming back to the legacy book, because the California retro and the new stores create a little bit of obfuscation, but the third quarter legacy book is going to produce an 88.8, the second half is an 89.3 in the full year, legacy book is 89.3. In this incredibly difficult time of a huge shift in the risk pool, we're operating on our legacy book only 30 basis points above the high end of our range, combination of corridor protection, rates catching up to an accelerated trend. I'll answer the second question first and kick the first question to Mark. On behavioral, the reason we cited Kentucky, it was a program change that caused it. There is a suspension of utilization management in Kentucky during the pandemic, which of course caused behavioral costs to go up. We are seeing pockets of trend inflection on behavioral services broad based across the country. In Kentucky, it was more pronounced because of the program change. But the stigma over receiving behavioral services is removed. Providers are open for business. They really suffered in terms of service revenue during the pandemic. And of course, the pandemic created all kinds of behavioral issues in the population. So it is a national trend. The reason we called out Kentucky, it was because of a program change. I'm only pausing, Michael, because I'm having difficulty understanding the question. D-SNP lives in our Medicare book and pressure on what aspect of these D-SNP lives are you referring to? I can only comment on our D-SNP business. As you know, our Medicare business is performing well. A 4.5% pre-tax margin, we targeted six, 5.5% to six, but in this environment, we're pretty pleased with it. Demonstrations are doing well, D-SNP book is doing well, and as I said, we expanded our county footprint by 23%. We're really focusing on the dual eligible D-SNP population, and of course the Michigan win was huge. We have an MMP book that's going to convert to a fully integrated product here in 2026. So I can only comment that we're very bullish on the D-SNP population, we're focusing intensely on it. The final rule passed by CMS gives players with a substantial Medicaid footprint a huge advantage to take advantage of this great growth opportunity, and it's a profitable book to business for us. We have a proven track record of managing high-acuity lives effectively. Sure, Scott, it's Joe. I'm going to make a framing comment and kick it to Mark for some color on the numbers, but the first thing, one of the reasons we usually hesitate to talk about corridors either in dollars or in basis points of cushion is you never know that you're going to be using it in a place where you have it. If you have negative trend experience, if it happens in a place where there's no corridor protection, there's zero protection, and if it happens everywhere we do have protection, it's 100% protected. So averages actually can be misleading, but I will tell you in each of the past four years we've been operating with about 200 basis points of protection at every point in time. Mark?"

After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference to Jeffrey Geyer, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nJeffrey Geyer: Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare's second quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our second quarter 2024 earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those of you who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that, all of the remarks are made as of today, Thursday, July 25, 2024 and has not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the second quarter 2024 earnings release. During the call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to statements regarding our 2024 guidance, Medicaid redeterminations, expected Medicaid rate adjustments, medical cost initiatives, and our projected MCR, our recent RFP awards and related revenue growth, our acquisitions and M&A activity, our long-term growth strategy, and our embedded earnings power and future earnings realization. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K Annual Report filed with the SEC, as well as our risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe.\nJoseph Zubretsky : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Today, we will provide you with updates on our reported financial results for the second quarter highlighted by $5.86 of earnings per share, which was in line with our expectations. An update on our full year 2024 guidance, which we reaffirm at $38 billion of premium revenue and at least $23.50 in earnings per share, and our growth initiatives and strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Let me start with our second quarter performance. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.86 a $9.4 billion of premium revenue. Our 88.6% consolidated MCR reflects disciplined medical cost management despite experiencing some modest medical cost pressure. We produced a 4.6% adjusted pre-tax margin or 3.5% after-tax, a very strong result that is in the middle of our long-term target range. Year-to-date, our consolidated MCR is also 88.6%, and our adjusted pre-tax margin is 4.5%, both within our long-term target ranges. Our well-balanced portfolio of businesses and focusing on managing medical costs continue to produce results in line with our expectations. In Medicaid, the business produced a second quarter MCR of 90.8%, above our long-term target range. This quarter included a one-time prior year retroactive premium item in our California business. Excluding this one-time item, the second quarter MCR was 90.1%, elevated by higher MCRs from our new store additions, a dynamic consistent with the first quarter. It also reflects slightly higher than expected medical costs in the legacy Medicaid portfolio, attributable to the ongoing acuity shift of redeterminations. We continue to have risk- corridor protection in many geographies and expect that this medical cost pressure will be adequately captured by known rate adjustments in the second half of 2024. We expect our Medicaid results to improve in the second half of the year. Several data points indicate we are well on track in this regard. First, the California retro rate item will not repeat. Second, our new store addition results will continue to improve as they did in the second quarter. Third, we received rates in many states for the second half of 2024 that were in line with first half developing cost trends. Approximately 35% of our Medicaid premium revenue renews in the second half. Combined with several off-cycle adjustments, these account for the expected legacy Medicaid MCR improvement through the remainder of the year. Then, with approximately 55% of our Medicaid premium revenue scheduled to renew on January 1, our rate cycle cadence is well timed for early 2025. Providing upside to our outlook for the balance of the year would be continued success with rate advocacy initiatives that could provide positive off-cycle rate adjustments. Turning to Medicare, our second quarter reported MCR was 84.9%, representing better than expected performance across all our Medicare products, primarily due to favorable risk adjustment results as well as benefit adjustments implemented for 2024. Our newly acquired Bright business in California is performing in line with expectations, and we remain confident in ultimately delivering the full one-rate accretion of $1 per share. Our strategy of leveraging our existing Medicaid footprint to serve high-acuity, low-income Medicare beneficiaries is working well. In Marketplace, the second quarter MCR was 71.6%. This business performed better than our expectations, even as we saw higher special enrollment period membership gains from redeterminations. Our mix of renewing members, prior year pricing actions, and improved risk adjustment results position us well to continue to profitably grow this book of business. Turning now to our guidance for the full year. We remain confident in delivering our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $23.50, or 13% year-over-year growth. Strong net investment income and known rates will offset the one-time retro premium item and the second quarter pressure experienced in Medicaid. Performance in our core business remains strong, and we expect second half improvements to be driven by known on and off-cycle rate increases and new store MCRs reverting to target. Our guidance also includes our Florida and Virginia contracts extending through year end. Our full year premium revenue remains unchanged at approximately $38 billion or 17% year-over-year growth. Our 2024 revenue and earnings per share guidance provide a strong foundation for profitable growth in 2025 and beyond, and the building blocks to get there remain intact. Now some comments on our growth initiatives. Our business is well positioned to capitalize on unique long-term growth opportunities in all three segments. First, a few comments on our recently announced acquisition of ConnectiCare from EmblemHealth. ConnectiCare currently serves approximately 140,000 members with $1.4 billion in annual premium revenue. This is a well-diversified government sponsored healthcare play, which serves primarily Marketplace and Medicare membership in Connecticut. Historically, our strategy has been to establish these core product lines only in our pre-existing Medicaid footprint to leverage our Medicaid infrastructure. While that option is not available to us in Connecticut, a Medicaid fee-for-service state, we believe this is a great opportunity to execute the time-tested Molina M&A playbook. Acquire a stable revenue stream in our core products, deploy capital efficiently, and improve the assets' performance in the proven and reliable Molina way. We expect this acquisition to provide earnings accretion of $1 in earnings per share, which is now added to our embedded earnings. Our M&A pipeline remains full of many actionable opportunities. In Medicaid, we remain confident in winning new and renewal business contracts. Some comments on recent developments. In Florida, we were recently awarded a contract that successfully retains our foothold in the state. We will retain our 52,000 Medicaid members in the Miami-Dade region. In addition, by agreement, we will grow to approximately 90,000 members through preferential auto assignment. We estimate the annual premium revenue of $500 million. In Wisconsin, we successfully defended our LTSS position as the state announced its intent to award Molina a contract to provide services in Region 5, the first of a series of regional reprocurements. Additionally, we were just re-awarded our sole contract position in the IRIS Self Directed Personal Care program. In Georgia, while we await the award announcement, we remain confident as to our prospects and believe that we are well positioned to serve that state's Medicaid population. Finally, there was significant market opportunity out for bid over the next three years. This includes the Texas STAR Kids RFP, which represents a meaningful opportunity in a state where we have demonstrated recent success. In Medicare, we remain sharply focused on further penetration of low-income, high-acuity dual-eligible populations and on our high-acuity MAPD population in California. The new CMS rules on Medicare and Medicaid integration position us well to attract dual-eligible members over the coming years, as our footprint combines both products in most of our states, enabling a fully integrated member experience. We are in the process of further developing our suite of integrated duals products, and we will soon be establishing a new dedicated organization to lead this effort. In Marketplace, we are positioned to grow organically in underpenetrated markets, given the stabilized risk profile and margins we've achieved. We believe our rate filings for 2025 make us very competitive in underpenetrated geographies and position us well to grow. As a reminder, our growth outlook in this business can be simply stated as grow at a rate that allows us to sustain mid-single digit pre-tax margins. We are confident in our ability to grow organically, win new state contracts, and execute our M&A strategy. These remain consistent pillars of our growth strategy, and we expect to meet our target of $46 billion of premium revenue in 2026. With our 2024 earnings per share guidance of at least $23.50 reaffirmed, and with our embedded earnings outlook of $5, we remain committed to delivering on our long-term earnings per share growth targets. As Mark will describe shortly, the building blocks to get there are intact. In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter 2024 financial performance. The Medicare and Marketplace businesses significantly outperformed, while Medicaid is on track to improve in the second half of the year through known rate increases and continuing new store MCR improvements. In the meantime, we continue to focus on executing on the fundamentals, which has been the hallmark of our financial performance. The unprecedented redetermination process, which will be a 24-month journey from beginning to end, has presented some challenges that we have successfully navigated. But nothing has occurred during this period that changes our view that these are attractive businesses for the near and long-term, and profitable growth can and will be sustained. In fact, our results demonstrate that the principle of rate soundness works in that Molina's unique rate corridor position protects against transient quarter-to-quarter fluctuations of rates and medical costs. Finally, we look forward to updating you on our outlook for sustaining profitable growth at an Investor Day event on Friday, November 8th in New York City. As in past years, we will provide you with our detailed playbook for achieving our growth targets and maintaining industry-leading margins. We will outline our long-term goals and how we will achieve them with the transparency and specificity that you have come to expect from us. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials.\nMark Keim : Thanks, Joe. And good morning, everyone. Today I'll discuss some additional details on our second quarter performance, the balance sheet, our 2024 guidance, and the building blocks of our 2025 EPS outlook. Beginning with our second quarter results. For the quarter, we reported approximately $10 billion in total revenue and $9.4 billion of premium revenue, with adjusted EPS of $5.86. Our second quarter consolidated MCR of 88.6%, was slightly above our expectations, but still on track to support our full year guidance. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was 90.8%. As Joe mentioned, this result includes a 70 basis point increase from a one-time retroactive premium adjustment in California related to the prior year. It is highly unusual for a state to retroactively reduce rates, and all of our known and expected future rate actions are positive as states address recent trends. Adjusting for this one-time prior year item, our reported MCR of 90.8% falls to 90.1%. Within that result, new store additions continue to run at a higher MCR, but lower than the first quarter and in line with our expectations. Recall, new store additions comprise almost 20% of our Medicaid segment this year. Adjusting for new store impact, our reported MCR falls another 80 basis points. We expect the MCR on this component to continue to decline over the coming quarters as these plans progress towards portfolio target margins. Excluding the one-time prior year item and the new store additions, our legacy Medicaid MCR was 89.3%, approximately 30 basis points above the top end of our long-term target range. We continue to experience the impact of redetermination related acuity shifts, a little more pronounced in the second quarter. Of course, Molina's strong performance in medical cost management means that in many states in recent years, we have typically been paying into minimum MLRs and corridors, an expense averaging 200 basis points within our reported MCR. As medical cost trend has modestly outpaced rates in the first and second quarters of the year, corridor expenses declined, largely shielding us from the temporary difference between rates and observed trend. We expect these corridor positions to be restored in coming quarters with our continuing medical cost discipline and the known and expected rate cycles. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, as Joe mentioned, we expect a number of items to drive the second half Medicaid MCR lower. For the first half of 2024, our reported Medicaid MCR was 90.2%. Our guidance includes the second half Medicaid MCR of 88.4%, a 180 basis point improvement driven by a few items. First, we reduced the second half expected MCR for the impact of this quarter's retro rate item, a benefit of 30 basis points to the second half Medicaid MCR compared to the first half. Second, new store additions, initially running higher than the legacy book, will continue to improve as they did in the second quarter as they approach portfolio target margins. New stores, a combination of new RFP wins and acquisitions, benefit from the execution of the Molina playbook quarter-over-quarter, and we expect 80 basis points of improvement to the second half Medicaid MCR compared to the first half. Third, the rate cycle of our state mix is well timed to return rates in line with the trend for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. States are required to fund Medicaid MCOs with actuarially sound rates. Most states determine those rates based on demonstrated market trends and completed data rather than working hypotheses or speculation. As such, the higher trends most plans are seeing in the first and second quarters provides hard data for the rate setting process in coming months. We now have full visibility on higher final rates that offset observed trend representing approximately 35% of our revenue renewing in the second half of the year. In addition to the normal rate cycle, our rate advocacy efforts have already yielded positive off-cycle adjustments in four states that benefit the second half of the year. We are encouraged that several other states will follow this approach, although we do not include those in our guidance. Together, these known rate adjustments drive an expected benefit of 70 basis points to the second half Medicaid MCR when compared to the first half. Combining the first half reported MCR in our expectations for 180 basis point improvement in the second half as detailed results in full-year Medicaid guidance of 89.3% up from our previous guidance of 89%. This small increase in full-year Medicaid MCR guidance is almost entirely explained by this quarter's retro rate item. Also in Medicaid, a few comments on membership. While two of our states are continuing with redetermination in the third quarter, we are largely through the process. In the second quarter, we estimate a net loss of 100,000 Medicaid members through redetermination, taking the cumulative total to 650,000. Due to the timing of reconnects that will continue into the third and fourth quarters, our outlook for the ultimate total net loss of approximately 600,000 or 40% of the members gained is unchanged. Our full-year membership guidance remains at 5.1 million members. Conversions to marketplace remain strong as Medicaid members losing eligibility move to Molina marketplace products. In Medicare, our second quarter reported MCR with 84.9%. All Medicare products perform better than expected, driven by favorable risk adjustments and the benefit adjustments we implemented for 2024. Utilization in the quarter reflected consistent pressure from LTSS costs and pharmacy utilization. As Joe mentioned, the integration of the Bright business is on track to provide the projected ultimate $1 of earning accretion. In Marketplace, our second quarter reported MCR with 71.6%, better than expected. Despite higher special enrollment period membership year-to-date, we remain focused on growing this business while producing mid-single digit pre-tax margins. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 6.9%, as expected, and reflects operating discipline and the continued benefit of fixed-cause leverage as we grow our business. Turning to the balance sheet, our capital foundation remains strong. In the quarter, we harvested approximately $175 million of subsidiary dividends, and our parent company cash balance was approximately $235 million at the end of the quarter. Debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged and 1.4 times trailing 12-month EBITDA, with our debt-to-cap ratio at about 33%. These ratios reflect our low-leverage position and ample cash and capital capacity for additional growth and investment. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 50 and consistent with prior quarters. We remained confident in the strength of our reserves. Our operating cash flow for the first six months of 2024 was lower than prior year due to the timing of corridor payments, CMS receipts, as well as taxes. This year, we made several large corridor settlement payments related to prior periods. Next, a few comments on our 2024 guidance. As Joe mentioned, we reaffirm our full-year guidance with premium revenue of approximately $38 billion. We continued to expect full-year EPS of at least $23.50. Our EPS guidance now includes $0.65 of higher expected investment income as short-term rates are expected to hold up through the year, higher for longer, and $0.30 from the extension of the current Florida and Virginia contracts through 2024 year end. These items are offset by approximately $0.65 from the one-time retro premium adjustment and $0.30 due to Medicaid performance in the second quarter. Within our guidance, the full-year consolidated MCR increases slightly to 88.4% driven by the second quarter performance in Medicaid. As detailed, the full year Medicaid MCR is now expected to be approximately 89.3% up 30 basis points, primarily due to the second quarter one time item. Our MCR guidance on Medicare remains unchanged at 88% with strong, consistent year to date performance in our duals membership and the Bright acquisition. In Marketplace, we continue to expect the full year MCR to be 78% and at the low end of its long term target range while producing mid single digit pre-tax margins. Conversions to Marketplace due to Medicaid redeterminations are expected to continue into the second half of the year, while SEP growth typically comes with a higher MCR, we considered this in our 2024 guidance and the pricing of our 2025 bids. Turning to embedded earnings and the building blocks of our 2025 EPS outlook, our guidance on new store embedded earnings is now $5 per share, an increase from our prior outlook of $4. This increase reflects $1 from the ConnectiCare acquisition. We expect a little more than half of the new store embedded earnings to emerge in 2025 with the remainder in 2026. Finally, we see a clear path to achieve our EPS growth target heading into 2025. The building blocks include the embedded earnings we expect in 2025, the continuing organic growth and margin in our current footprint, and our in-flight organic and inorganic strategic initiatives. With 55% of our revenue renewing on January 1st of next year, our rate cycle is well timed for 2025. Even allowing for some headwinds from likely declining interest rates next year, the path is clear and compelling. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.\nA.J. Rice : Hi, everybody. Thanks for the question. Just maybe as a point of clarification. You're calling out risk adjustment true-up that's helped you both in public exchanges and in Medicare Advantage. Any way to size that and talk about how much of a positive variance it was relative to guidance? And then my other follow-up would be on the Medicaid side. Some of your peers, not all of them, but some are calling out that the legacy population they are left with seems to be having a little bit higher utilization than they had previously seen. It's not just deterioration on the risk pool related to redetermination. Have you seen any of that or is this what you are seeing in Medicaid, 100% related to just what's happening as a result of redetermination?\nMark Keim : Great. Hey, good morning, A.J. I'll take the first one and Joe will pick up the second one. On risk adjustment, let's touch on Marketplace and Medicare. On Marketplace, some of you have seen from the CMS files, we recognize about $20 million of additional risk adjustment benefit from the prior year between first and second quarter. Remember, we have insights on the development of that through the weekly service and other things, but across the first half, about $20 million from the prior year. So, first half revenue is about $1.2 billion. You do the math, a little bit less than 20 basis points in our first half, first and second quarter MLRs for Marketplace. Just for reference, it was about the same a year ago. So the year-over-year as compared, it's about the same, about 20 basis points of benefit.\nJoseph Zubretsky : A.J. on your second question related to \u2013 I'm sorry. Please, go ahead.\nA.J. Rice : Just on the...\nJoseph Zubretsky: Say it again A.J. A.J., I think we lost you, but let me take your second question related to medical cost trends in the business. In Medicaid, as always, you see pockets of utilization increases in various geographies and in various healthcare categories. We see some pockets of skilled nursing facility cost increases, hours in home-based care. BH is spiking in a couple of geographies, but nothing we've never seen before. Pharmacy trend to high-cost drugs in the GLP-1s, certainly putting some cost pressure on the system. But again, nothing out of the ordinary and nothing that can't be dealt with, particularly as our corridor position absorbs these trends and then rates kick in to pick up the slack.\nA.J. Rice : Okay, thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Andrew Mok with Barclays.\nAndrew Mok : Hi, good morning. Just a question on the underlying Medicaid pressure in the same-store portfolio. I don't remember you calling out pressure in Q1, but it sounds like that may have developed slightly worse. Is that correct? And can you clarify when core Medicaid pressure started to materialize this year? Thanks.\nMark Keim: Sure, you are right. We saw a little bit more pressure in the legacy book in the second quarter versus the first quarter, and one of the drivers is just simply membership. You might recall, in the first quarter we noticed that we lost about 50,000 members due to redetermination. We were a little more than that in the second quarter at about 100,000. Just to round that out, we're currently at 650,000 total cumulative, and we expect to get back about 50,000 in the rest of the year through reconnects. So the volume, the membership up a little bit in the second quarter. I don't doubt that drove a lot of the higher legacy impacts we saw.\nAndrew Mok : Got it. But did Q1 also come in worse than what you had expected when you actually saw the claims?\nJoseph Zubretsky: It was a little bit higher than normal, but not worse than we expected in the first quarter.\nAndrew Mok : Okay. And then secondly, it sounds like you are describing a more modest pressure relative to peers. So I just wanted to better understand that experience. How much pressure was offset by the risk corridor buffer? And do you see modest pressure across most states or concentrated pressure in a few states? Thanks.\nJoseph Zubretsky: The pressure is isolated. It's various healthcare cost categories in various of our individual health plans. And Mark covered this in his prepared remarks. Sometimes it's overlooked. We've been routinely over the past four years, paying into the risk corridors at minimum MLRs to the extent of about 200 basis points inside our NCR, which basically means if you are reporting an 88, you are performing at an 86, which gives you 200 basis points of cushion if a medical cost should inflect for any reason, whether it's an acuity shift or whether it's normal trend. So we see pockets of utilization increases as I described, in various categories, in various plans, but largely picked up by the corridors and mid-cycle rate increases and on-cycle rate increases, particularly in the second half of the year where 35% of our revenue renews in the second half.\nAndrew Mok : Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Ryan Langston with TD Cowen.\nRyan Langston : Hey, good morning. Following up on Medicaid, we've heard some commentary just from some peers that there's this pull-through effect when folks are receiving their enrollment loss information and then they might be utilizing more services before they actually use it. I guess, are you seeing that same kind of experience? And then maybe further, do you have any sense of what the utilization profile actually looks like for folks who actually are able to re-enroll once being redetermined off? Is that any different than sort of the normal population? Thanks.\nJoseph Zubretsky: We've heard the discussion about over-utilizing in advance of losing coverage. We have not experienced that. Our leavers are leaving at the same MCR from the beginning of the redetermination process to the end. No change and no indication that they are using services in advance particularly, because in the termination process, many of them don't know that they've been redetermined. So they don't have any advance notice. They are just off the Medicaid rolls. They weren't using services and now they are off through the redetermination process. So we haven't seen that.\nMark Keim: Ryan, I\u2019ll just build on that. What we've been citing and what many others are seeing, is that of the folks that get redetermined, they lose their eligibility, 70% are for procedural reasons. That means they just didn't fill out the paperwork or weren't aware. So that certainly argues against any kind of last minute usage, when in fact they weren't aware they were losing coverage. I think you also asked about the reconnects, when they come back in. Yes, very often for the first month we'll see a little bit of higher utilization. And think about it, somebody lost their eligibility. They might not know they lost it until two or three months later when they go to the drug store to fill out a script. At that point they are utilizing and that first month might be a little bit higher. But typically they are going to quickly resolve to the portfolio average. So we're not seeing any meaningful impact there.\nRyan Langston : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin : Hi! Thanks. Just a clarification on the margin side of the Medicaid book. So could you just tell us what your Medicaid margins were in 1Q versus 2Q and what's embedded in guidance for the second half? And then my bigger question is just, the commercial MLR last year, exchanges were 75%. I think you said 78% MLR this year. It looks like you are tracking probably favorable to that. So how are you thinking about the potential for rebates next year? And should we be thinking about a strategy of reducing price to get higher membership for 2025?\nJoseph Zubretsky: I'll take the last part of that first Josh on marketplace. Clearly running at 72 for the first half and predicting 78 for the back half seems to be a push. But be mindful of the fact that SEP membership is quite high and those members are coming in at higher utilization rates than the existing membership. And then of course you have the natural seasonality of the business. Now, you are absolutely right. Last year, we actually invested margin in growth and we grew at $1 billion to $1.2 billion of revenue this year. Where we're running this year, we think we're at par. We think we're right in the single-digit land, but we could. You could see us be a little more aggressive on growth next year and try to grow this business as we did in 2024 over \u201823. So the margin position is solid. And again, our growth rate is going to be determined by our ability to produce mid-single-digit margins, just given the inherent volatility that exists in the business itself.\nMark Keim:  Great, and I'll go ahead and take the second one. Josh, per our reported results, as you know, the MCR in the first quarter on Medicaid was an 89.7. We reported a 90.8. Across the first half of the year, that's an average of a 90.2. We're tracking to an 89.3 for the full year, and I gave you the walk in my prepared remarks of how the second half supports that. We have great confidence in those three building blocks that support that. Now the 89.3 for the full year guidance is up from 89. The last time we were together, so we've raised the full year guidance by 30 bips. Two-thirds of that was just recognizing that one-time California item we had to jump over in the second quarter. So the rest is just a little bit of pressure from the second quarter legacy business, otherwise very much on track for an 89.3 full year.\nJosh Raskin : Okay, so target margin, but this year not terribly off from target margins, right? Sort of towards the lower end maybe of the turn. Okay, perfect.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Correct, and I think there'll be enough strength that we pointed out otherwise in the business to more than overcome that 30-bip increase. So I think we're in good shape.\nJosh Raskin : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. I guess we're having a hard time kind of reconciling your view about where MLR is in Medicaid versus what a lot of your peers are doing. So I guess, your comment seems to be that your risk corridors are allowing you to kind of offset a lot of this pressure. Can you give us a sense of on a gross basis then what\u2019s the MLR pressure? Are you saying you had 200 basis points of risk corridor and now it's only 100? And then there's another 10 or 20 in the core net because of payables not completely matching everything. Like just kind of size it for us. It seems like everybody else seems to be saying somewhere between 100 and 150 basis points of MLR pressure and just to hear 10 or 20 in the core, it\u2019s hard to reconcile. And then, I guess you mentioned you expect people to be coming back as the year goes on. Shouldn't that be a pressure on MLR in the back half of the year? It didn't seem like you were building anything in for rejoiners putting up a pressure on MLR in your bridge from one half to two half. Thanks.\nJoseph Zubretsky: Well, Mark gave you the numbers in the prepared remarks that are actual in the last four years. We have been paying in to the corridors to the extent of 200 basis points, contributing to the Medicaid MCR, 200 basis points. We said at the beginning of the redetermination process, we said this repeatedly, that the corridors were going to act as a financial buffer until such times rates pick up the slack, which is exactly what's happening. So yes, suffice it to say, this year our corridor liability isn't 200 basis points. We've used some of it to cushion the results, but some of it does remain in various geographies in a meaningful way. Now, the other point to make on the corridors is they don't just disappear forever. They replenish at the next rate cycle, whatever the state fiscal year is. And so if you could actually sound rates at the next rate cycle and you continue to relatively outperform that benchmark, you are back into the corridors and you are recreating that 200 basis points of cushion.\nMark Keim: And Kevin, just a couple more thoughts. Since our last guidance in the first quarter, we probably see trend across our business for the year, up 150 basis points, 1.5% higher trend than we thought before. That's capturing what we saw in the second quarter and what we're expecting for the third and fourth. And of course, to your point, that includes the dynamic for the rejoiners and just as importantly what we're actually jumping off in the second quarter. So we're seeing a higher trend than we previously thought of 1.5%. Now, as we detailed, we've got known rate adjustments in the second half, both on cycle and off cycle, which defray about 1% across the full year of that trend. The other 50 bips is picked up by corridors. So we feel pretty insulated from a higher trend here, both on known rates and as Joe mentioned, this very important corridor dynamic we bring to the table. So yeah, we've been carrying 200 bips over the last couple of years within our reported MCR. It'll be lower this year, but that'll be a function of actual rates and the ultimate trend.\nKevin Fischbeck : Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. First, it looked like your PYD benefit to MLR was almost 200 basis points in the quarter. I'm curious if you could share with us whether that was evenly spread among the three segments or was balanced in one or two specifically. And then Joe, can you talk to us a little bit about exchanges, a lot of focus going into the elections. What's your early view on, if the subsidies aren't extended, the enhanced subsidies I should say. If they aren't extended at the end of 2025, what do you think happens to the exchange population in general?\nJoseph Zubretsky: On the PYD point -- I'll kick it to Mark, but the first point to make before which lines of business did it affect. Most of it, if not nearly all of it, was picked up by prior year corridors. Mark, do you want to take it?\nMark Keim: Right. So Justin, your question is, yes, it's a little bit bigger than we've seen in the past, but we're a bigger business than we've been in the past. A lot of this stems from our payment integrity business, which reaches back into prior years to make sure that fraud, waste and abuse, things like that are addressed. So it's a little bit bigger. Of course, Medicaid and Medicare is where you expect to see it mostly, and that's what you'll see in the Q when it comes out. A little bit in marketplace, but most of it was in Medicaid and Medicare. As Joe mentioned, it really isn't a good guy this year, because we were big time corridor payers last year, and of course the prior year development goes to last year's corridors, so most of that got caught up in prior year corridors.\nJoseph Zubretsky: And your question related to the exchanges, everybody's got models. We see models in the industry. We have our own models in terms of what would happen if the enhanced subsidies are in fact, do expire. And there's industry estimates we have our own. You look at the level of subsidies, you look at your FPL cohorts, and you can argue that 10%, 20% of membership could be affected and priced out of your silver product, but then again, you have a lower priced bronze product, perhaps sitting right next to it. So how many of those are going to recapture into one of your bronze products, a little priced hard to say. But we've seen industry estimates of 10% to 20%, and then the wild card is if you have a bronze product sitting alongside your silver product in a certain geography, will you recapture some of that in bronze?\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter : Hi, thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups on the Medicaid discussion. I guess, can you provide us specifically the first half number that's comparable to the 200 basis points of the typical corridor expense that you cite? And then can you also update us on what percentage of your premiums have some level of protection here versus your more directly exposed to whatever the underlying performance in the Medicaid book is? And then just trying to understand the rate update process. I think you suggested, obviously the states want to operate on hard data and not theories. But it does seem like a lot of this deterioration is happening in the second quarter, which is not fully developed at this point. So is this largely because maybe the acuity adjustment compensated the lower level of disenrollment [inaudible] your conversation? I'm just trying to understand why the states would be compelled to act, kind of on a more recently developing trend. Thanks.\nMark Keim: Hey Stephen, it's Mark. There's a lot to unpack there. Can you start with the first one? I want to make sure I understand it.\nStephen Baxter : Yes. The 200 basis points of typical corridor expense that you cite, I would just like to know specifically in the first half of the year if you could give us a comparable metric there. And then when we think about the percentage of your Medicaid premiums that have some level of protection from those corridors versus are more directly exposed to the underlying performance of the business, like is it 50%, is it 75%? How should we think about that?\nMark Keim: Sure. Now, the way to think about corridors, in prior years, roughly 200 was usually embedded in our reported MCR. Corridors track to an ultimate across the full year. So you don't really know until the year is over where you come out, and again, that's going to be a function of rate and trend. But what I can tell you is in the first half, I think about half of that normal rate was within our number if we look at what's happened and our expected ultimates. So we're definitely using some of it year-to-date. And as we mentioned in our remarks here, we're expecting to use some of it in the rest of the year. So think across the full year, roughly half of that normal run rate number.\nJoseph Zubretsky: And Stephen, we have very detailed models. We have an entire accounting system on NIM and MLR and corridor tracking. And one of the reasons we don't give specific numbers generally is if 50% or 75% of your premium has a corridor, you say, well, it's protected. Well, it's only protected if that's where the medical cost deterioration happens. And so looking at the gross number can just be very, very misleading. We have our arms around it. We know where we're protected. We know where we have upside opportunity and some geographies there's upside opportunity depending on where you are in the corridor. So we generally don't like to give specific numbers on how much premium is protected, because I think it gives a false positive.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nSarah James : Thank you. I appreciate you reiterating the 2026 premium guidance. I was hoping that you could refresh the bridge a little bit. When you laid it out at I-Day [ph] off of the 23 base, you were talking about $4.5 billion of M&A and $2.5 billion of strategic initiatives. Is that still the mix that you see? And then when you think about M&A, how do you think about the mix between Medicaid and exchange that could play out through 2026 or that exists in your pipeline?\nJoseph Zubretsky: It is possible that if we're redoing that projection right now, it would have to be a little more influenced by M&A, just given where we are in the reprocurement cycle, but we're very active in the M&A space as we just demonstrated. Yeah, comments have been made that the last two transactions that we executed were Medicare and marketplace, which some people are calling non-core. They are core. They are as core as Medicaid. And our pipeline is still very active with Medicaid opportunities, and you'll hopefully see Medicaid transactions here over the next 12 to 18 months. We're still very active in that space. The last two we did were non-Medicaid, but that doesn't mean we're not actively pursuing them and working them.\nSarah James : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Hall with Baird.\nMichael Hall : All right, thank you. So a quick clarification and then my real question. I was surprised to see no cash flow from Ops so far, first half of the year. I know you called out special timing, corridor payments, CMS receipts, etc. I was wondering if you could break out some of the amounts of the larger pieces to help bridge us back to what maybe normalized cash flow from Ops would look like. And then the real question on MA risk adjustment benefit. Wondering if you could just \u2013 how much specifically did you benefit from it for your 2Q MA MLR? And generally, isn\u2019t it true that, yes, the risk adjustment fleets tend to result in some slight favorability, but also from my understanding, plans generally don't see a huge benefit, because they simply accrue to whatever the risk adjustment was in their early 1Q payments. So my question is, how did you recognize such a large benefit? Was there something unique going on with BrightHealth's MA assets where maybe you took a more conservative approach on the risk adjustment accrual? So more color on that would be great. Thank you.\nMark Keim: Hey, Michael. Good morning. It's Mark. Let me take OCF. As we mentioned, and for everybody's benefit, Michael's asking about a large difference in this year's first six months operating cash flow versus prior years. Just a note on that, I think some people forget that government services MCOs have a lot lumpier cash flow than maybe some of our diversified competitors. Commercial businesses tend to have much more stable quarter-to-quarter OCF as do services businesses. Government businesses, because of the timing of large payments, risk adjustment and corridors will be a little bit lumpier. The only other comment I'll make, and I'll get into the details Michael, is we are a growing business, and a growing business should always have OCF ahead of net investment income, because a growing business, that's the way the working capital cycle works, and we do. If you look at any broader time frame, you will see that. So the first half is really about a couple of unique items, unique items that benefited us last year and are now just sort of catching up. So there's three that we'll talk about and you'll see these on my operating cash flow in the earnings release. The largest one is the timing of risk corridor payments. Here's how to think about this. We're accruing less this year on risk corridors than we were last year for all the reasons Joe and I just discussed. But separately, I'm paying down last year's balances. So that's a big swing in OCF, call it a little more than $0.5 billion. Next one is CMS payments. You know it's funny, CMS payments usually come in a couple of days before the end of the quarter or a couple of days after the end of the quarter, and that makes a big difference on the reported cash flow. About 400 of our OCF swing is exactly that, and you'll see that on the operating cash flow statement. And the last one's a little bit unique. We had about $200 million of cash flow benefit year-over-year from California taxes. You might recall that California federal taxpayers got a little bit of a delay on their tax due dates back in 2023. So both, the 2022 final tax payments, as well as the estimated 2023 tax payments were delayed into the second half of the year. This year, we're right back on target. So year-over-year, that's a bad guy. This year, it was a good guy last year. That's $200 million right there. So I probably just walked you through the vast majority of that operating cash flow deficit you are talking about. We're very comfortable in the cash flow characteristics of the business. And again, look over any broader period of time, you'll see a great normalization in that relationship between OCF and net income. On the Medicare risk adjustment, a couple of comments there. Unlike Marketplace, most of that Medicare was a benefit from this year's operations, and gosh, we're just getting a little bit better at it. We've got a bigger business. We've got the bright business, and sure, there's always some prior year benefit. But a lot of this is, we're just getting better at the risk adjustment equation across each of our individual Medicare businesses.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel : Hi, thanks. Actually, just to follow-up, I guess to sort of complete out the operating cash flow discussion. Mark, can you give us what you are expecting for the back half of 2024 or for the full year for CFFO? And then second, I guess main question would be, definitely thought it would be helpful maybe if you just want to segment or bucket the dollar of embedded earnings that you're expecting from Connecticare in terms of what sort of the key drivers of that accretion to get to the dollar bill. Thanks.\nMark Keim: Sure. On the second half of OCF, a normal relationship is a little bit ahead of net income. So, think a relationship of 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, something like that. I would expect a more normalized relationship in the second half of the year. Again, looking over the two years in total, so much of that year-over-year comparison was about things unique to last year or unique to this year. Looking at \u201823, \u201824 combined, you'll get a very normal relationship between OCF and net income that'll certainly normalize in the second half of this year.\nJoseph Zubretsky: And Scott, on the Connecticare acquisition, the business performs okay. It does not perform to Molina target margins. As typical in these situations, we intend to improve the MCRs in both, the marketplace business and the Medicare business, and rationalize the G&A spend. It is not a huge undertaking. As I said, they are underperforming our targets, but not woefully underperforming. We will improve the performance by moving these simply from where they are to Molina targets. Pay per membership, good brand recognition. We bought it at 25% of revenue, half of which is hard capital. And then we unleashed the Molina playbook to get it to our target margins, the dollar of accretion. Great deal for us.\nScott Fidel : Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the last question this morning comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.\nGeorge Hill : Hey, good morning guys. And thanks for sneaking me in. I hope I have two quick ones here. I guess you talked about the example where you have acuity getting worse and states are cutting rates. Well I guess, talk to us about how confident you'll be that you'll kind of get rate in that percentage of the book going forward. Just increasingly as we're hearing like, we hear about actuarial soundness, but when we talk to some state regulators, we hear actual soundness is kind of with the phrase, \u2018subject to budget.\u2019 So kind of worried about the timing and the mismatch there. And then on the 200 basis points in the risk quarter that we discussed, I guess, can you talk about your confidence in the risk quarter, like the contributions. It'll suck up some utilization in the back half of this year, but I guess, can you talk about like how much was sucked up in Q2 and like how should we think about like the risk quarter \u2013 the decrease in risk quarter contributions in Q2 and kind of how that varies through the back half of the year? Thank you.\nMark Keim: Sure. A couple of things there. So you are mentioning the California negative retro rate adjustment. Look, I haven't personally seen one. That's the only one. I don't expect another one, but for the rest of the year, there's not speculation. Those rate increases that Joe and I talked about in the second half of the year, both the normal rate cycle and the off cycle rates, all of those are known and committed, so not a lot of speculation there. On the 200 basis points that you are talking about of historical, you can't really think about corridors on a quarterly basis, because they are an annual fiscal year concept. So you are always accruing to an ultimate, which means you are spreading out any impact across all four quarters, not quarter specific. So when I think about the full year and our fiscal year accounting, we said somewhere around half of the historical 200 is about what we think we're using. That's again a guess, and it will ultimately come down to the full year development of rates, trends, and our medical management.\nA - Joseph Zubretsky: And George, maybe it's best to give a couple of examples. So we have Texas is a September 1 renewal. Things were running a little hot in Texas. Acuity shift, etc. We had a high \u2013 the market got a high single digit rate increase. That will have impact to the second year, it's known. We have it in draft form. Draft rates never decline. They can go up, but we're very confident in it. Another example is a really interesting one. It actually explains some of the trend inflection we talked about that's very localized, and the rate actions that are taken in Kentucky. Due to the pandemic, the regulators asked the market to suspend UM on outpatient behavioral. We did, as did the market. What happens? Cost goes up. The market then approaches the state, presents the actual data, mid cycle rate increase because the behavioral program was underfunded. So the conversations with our state regulators, our customer are very productive. They are databased, and they are taking very reasonable positions, whether something is program related or whether it's an acuity shift that can be actually supported.\nGeorge Hill : Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes both the questions session as well as the event itself. Thank you so much for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Mark Keim",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. And good morning, everyone. Today I'll discuss some additional details on our second quarter performance, the balance sheet, our 2024 guidance, and the building blocks of our 2025 EPS outlook. Beginning with our second quarter results. For the quarter, we reported approximately $10 billion in total revenue and $9.4 billion of premium revenue, with adjusted EPS of $5.86. Our second quarter consolidated MCR of 88.6%, was slightly above our expectations, but still on track to support our full year guidance. In Medicaid, our reported MCR was 90.8%. As Joe mentioned, this result includes a 70 basis point increase from a one-time retroactive premium adjustment in California related to the prior year. It is highly unusual for a state to retroactively reduce rates, and all of our known and expected future rate actions are positive as states address recent trends. Adjusting for this one-time prior year item, our reported MCR of 90.8% falls to 90.1%. Within that result, new store additions continue to run at a higher MCR, but lower than the first quarter and in line with our expectations. Recall, new store additions comprise almost 20% of our Medicaid segment this year. Adjusting for new store impact, our reported MCR falls another 80 basis points. We expect the MCR on this component to continue to decline over the coming quarters as these plans progress towards portfolio target margins. Excluding the one-time prior year item and the new store additions, our legacy Medicaid MCR was 89.3%, approximately 30 basis points above the top end of our long-term target range. We continue to experience the impact of redetermination related acuity shifts, a little more pronounced in the second quarter. Of course, Molina's strong performance in medical cost management means that in many states in recent years, we have typically been paying into minimum MLRs and corridors, an expense averaging 200 basis points within our reported MCR. As medical cost trend has modestly outpaced rates in the first and second quarters of the year, corridor expenses declined, largely shielding us from the temporary difference between rates and observed trend. We expect these corridor positions to be restored in coming quarters with our continuing medical cost discipline and the known and expected rate cycles. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, as Joe mentioned, we expect a number of items to drive the second half Medicaid MCR lower. For the first half of 2024, our reported Medicaid MCR was 90.2%. Our guidance includes the second half Medicaid MCR of 88.4%, a 180 basis point improvement driven by a few items. First, we reduced the second half expected MCR for the impact of this quarter's retro rate item, a benefit of 30 basis points to the second half Medicaid MCR compared to the first half. Second, new store additions, initially running higher than the legacy book, will continue to improve as they did in the second quarter as they approach portfolio target margins. New stores, a combination of new RFP wins and acquisitions, benefit from the execution of the Molina playbook quarter-over-quarter, and we expect 80 basis points of improvement to the second half Medicaid MCR compared to the first half. Third, the rate cycle of our state mix is well timed to return rates in line with the trend for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. States are required to fund Medicaid MCOs with actuarially sound rates. Most states determine those rates based on demonstrated market trends and completed data rather than working hypotheses or speculation. As such, the higher trends most plans are seeing in the first and second quarters provides hard data for the rate setting process in coming months. We now have full visibility on higher final rates that offset observed trend representing approximately 35% of our revenue renewing in the second half of the year. In addition to the normal rate cycle, our rate advocacy efforts have already yielded positive off-cycle adjustments in four states that benefit the second half of the year. We are encouraged that several other states will follow this approach, although we do not include those in our guidance. Together, these known rate adjustments drive an expected benefit of 70 basis points to the second half Medicaid MCR when compared to the first half. Combining the first half reported MCR in our expectations for 180 basis point improvement in the second half as detailed results in full-year Medicaid guidance of 89.3% up from our previous guidance of 89%. This small increase in full-year Medicaid MCR guidance is almost entirely explained by this quarter's retro rate item. Also in Medicaid, a few comments on membership. While two of our states are continuing with redetermination in the third quarter, we are largely through the process. In the second quarter, we estimate a net loss of 100,000 Medicaid members through redetermination, taking the cumulative total to 650,000. Due to the timing of reconnects that will continue into the third and fourth quarters, our outlook for the ultimate total net loss of approximately 600,000 or 40% of the members gained is unchanged. Our full-year membership guidance remains at 5.1 million members. Conversions to marketplace remain strong as Medicaid members losing eligibility move to Molina marketplace products. In Medicare, our second quarter reported MCR with 84.9%. All Medicare products perform better than expected, driven by favorable risk adjustments and the benefit adjustments we implemented for 2024. Utilization in the quarter reflected consistent pressure from LTSS costs and pharmacy utilization. As Joe mentioned, the integration of the Bright business is on track to provide the projected ultimate $1 of earning accretion. In Marketplace, our second quarter reported MCR with 71.6%, better than expected. Despite higher special enrollment period membership year-to-date, we remain focused on growing this business while producing mid-single digit pre-tax margins. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 6.9%, as expected, and reflects operating discipline and the continued benefit of fixed-cause leverage as we grow our business. Turning to the balance sheet, our capital foundation remains strong. In the quarter, we harvested approximately $175 million of subsidiary dividends, and our parent company cash balance was approximately $235 million at the end of the quarter. Debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged and 1.4 times trailing 12-month EBITDA, with our debt-to-cap ratio at about 33%. These ratios reflect our low-leverage position and ample cash and capital capacity for additional growth and investment. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 50 and consistent with prior quarters. We remained confident in the strength of our reserves. Our operating cash flow for the first six months of 2024 was lower than prior year due to the timing of corridor payments, CMS receipts, as well as taxes. This year, we made several large corridor settlement payments related to prior periods. Next, a few comments on our 2024 guidance. As Joe mentioned, we reaffirm our full-year guidance with premium revenue of approximately $38 billion. We continued to expect full-year EPS of at least $23.50. Our EPS guidance now includes $0.65 of higher expected investment income as short-term rates are expected to hold up through the year, higher for longer, and $0.30 from the extension of the current Florida and Virginia contracts through 2024 year end. These items are offset by approximately $0.65 from the one-time retro premium adjustment and $0.30 due to Medicaid performance in the second quarter. Within our guidance, the full-year consolidated MCR increases slightly to 88.4% driven by the second quarter performance in Medicaid. As detailed, the full year Medicaid MCR is now expected to be approximately 89.3% up 30 basis points, primarily due to the second quarter one time item. Our MCR guidance on Medicare remains unchanged at 88% with strong, consistent year to date performance in our duals membership and the Bright acquisition. In Marketplace, we continue to expect the full year MCR to be 78% and at the low end of its long term target range while producing mid single digit pre-tax margins. Conversions to Marketplace due to Medicaid redeterminations are expected to continue into the second half of the year, while SEP growth typically comes with a higher MCR, we considered this in our 2024 guidance and the pricing of our 2025 bids. Turning to embedded earnings and the building blocks of our 2025 EPS outlook, our guidance on new store embedded earnings is now $5 per share, an increase from our prior outlook of $4. This increase reflects $1 from the ConnectiCare acquisition. We expect a little more than half of the new store embedded earnings to emerge in 2025 with the remainder in 2026. Finally, we see a clear path to achieve our EPS growth target heading into 2025. The building blocks include the embedded earnings we expect in 2025, the continuing organic growth and margin in our current footprint, and our in-flight organic and inorganic strategic initiatives. With 55% of our revenue renewing on January 1st of next year, our rate cycle is well timed for 2025. Even allowing for some headwinds from likely declining interest rates next year, the path is clear and compelling. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Great. Hey, good morning, A.J. I'll take the first one and Joe will pick up the second one. On risk adjustment, let's touch on Marketplace and Medicare. On Marketplace, some of you have seen from the CMS files, we recognize about $20 million of additional risk adjustment benefit from the prior year between first and second quarter. Remember, we have insights on the development of that through the weekly service and other things, but across the first half, about $20 million from the prior year. So, first half revenue is about $1.2 billion. You do the math, a little bit less than 20 basis points in our first half, first and second quarter MLRs for Marketplace. Just for reference, it was about the same a year ago. So the year-over-year as compared, it's about the same, about 20 basis points of benefit. Sure, you are right. We saw a little bit more pressure in the legacy book in the second quarter versus the first quarter, and one of the drivers is just simply membership. You might recall, in the first quarter we noticed that we lost about 50,000 members due to redetermination. We were a little more than that in the second quarter at about 100,000. Just to round that out, we're currently at 650,000 total cumulative, and we expect to get back about 50,000 in the rest of the year through reconnects. So the volume, the membership up a little bit in the second quarter. I don't doubt that drove a lot of the higher legacy impacts we saw. Ryan, I'll just build on that. What we've been citing and what many others are seeing, is that of the folks that get redetermined, they lose their eligibility, 70% are for procedural reasons. That means they just didn't fill out the paperwork or weren't aware. So that certainly argues against any kind of last minute usage, when in fact they weren't aware they were losing coverage. I think you also asked about the reconnects, when they come back in. Yes, very often for the first month we'll see a little bit of higher utilization. And think about it, somebody lost their eligibility. They might not know they lost it until two or three months later when they go to the drug store to fill out a script. At that point they are utilizing and that first month might be a little bit higher. But typically they are going to quickly resolve to the portfolio average. So we're not seeing any meaningful impact there. Great, and I'll go ahead and take the second one. Josh, per our reported results, as you know, the MCR in the first quarter on Medicaid was an 89.7. We reported a 90.8. Across the first half of the year, that's an average of a 90.2. We're tracking to an 89.3 for the full year, and I gave you the walk in my prepared remarks of how the second half supports that. We have great confidence in those three building blocks that support that. Now the 89.3 for the full year guidance is up from 89. The last time we were together, so we've raised the full year guidance by 30 bips. Two-thirds of that was just recognizing that one-time California item we had to jump over in the second quarter. So the rest is just a little bit of pressure from the second quarter legacy business, otherwise very much on track for an 89.3 full year. And Kevin, just a couple more thoughts. Since our last guidance in the first quarter, we probably see trend across our business for the year, up 150 basis points, 1.5% higher trend than we thought before. That's capturing what we saw in the second quarter and what we're expecting for the third and fourth. And of course, to your point, that includes the dynamic for the rejoiners and just as importantly what we're actually jumping off in the second quarter. So we're seeing a higher trend than we previously thought of 1.5%. Now, as we detailed, we've got known rate adjustments in the second half, both on cycle and off cycle, which defray about 1% across the full year of that trend. The other 50 bips is picked up by corridors. So we feel pretty insulated from a higher trend here, both on known rates and as Joe mentioned, this very important corridor dynamic we bring to the table. So yeah, we've been carrying 200 bips over the last couple of years within our reported MCR. It'll be lower this year, but that'll be a function of actual rates and the ultimate trend. Right. So Justin, your question is, yes, it's a little bit bigger than we've seen in the past, but we're a bigger business than we've been in the past. A lot of this stems from our payment integrity business, which reaches back into prior years to make sure that fraud, waste and abuse, things like that are addressed. So it's a little bit bigger. Of course, Medicaid and Medicare is where you expect to see it mostly, and that's what you'll see in the Q when it comes out. A little bit in marketplace, but most of it was in Medicaid and Medicare. As Joe mentioned, it really isn't a good guy this year, because we were big time corridor payers last year, and of course the prior year development goes to last year's corridors, so most of that got caught up in prior year corridors. Hey Stephen, it's Mark. There's a lot to unpack there. Can you start with the first one? I want to make sure I understand it. Sure. Now, the way to think about corridors, in prior years, roughly 200 was usually embedded in our reported MCR. Corridors track to an ultimate across the full year. So you don't really know until the year is over where you come out, and again, that's going to be a function of rate and trend. But what I can tell you is in the first half, I think about half of that normal rate was within our number if we look at what's happened and our expected ultimates. So we're definitely using some of it year-to-date. And as we mentioned in our remarks here, we're expecting to use some of it in the rest of the year. So think across the full year, roughly half of that normal run rate number. Hey, Michael. Good morning. It's Mark. Let me take OCF. As we mentioned, and for everybody's benefit, Michael's asking about a large difference in this year's first six months operating cash flow versus prior years. Just a note on that, I think some people forget that government services MCOs have a lot lumpier cash flow than maybe some of our diversified competitors. Commercial businesses tend to have much more stable quarter-to-quarter OCF as do services businesses. Government businesses, because of the timing of large payments, risk adjustment and corridors will be a little bit lumpier. The only other comment I'll make, and I'll get into the details Michael, is we are a growing business, and a growing business should always have OCF ahead of net investment income, because a growing business, that's the way the working capital cycle works, and we do. If you look at any broader time frame, you will see that. So the first half is really about a couple of unique items, unique items that benefited us last year and are now just sort of catching up. So there's three that we'll talk about and you'll see these on my operating cash flow in the earnings release. The largest one is the timing of risk corridor payments. Here's how to think about this. We're accruing less this year on risk corridors than we were last year for all the reasons Joe and I just discussed. But separately, I'm paying down last year's balances. So that's a big swing in OCF, call it a little more than $0.5 billion. Next one is CMS payments. You know it's funny, CMS payments usually come in a couple of days before the end of the quarter or a couple of days after the end of the quarter, and that makes a big difference on the reported cash flow. About 400 of our OCF swing is exactly that, and you'll see that on the operating cash flow statement. And the last one's a little bit unique. We had about $200 million of cash flow benefit year-over-year from California taxes. You might recall that California federal taxpayers got a little bit of a delay on their tax due dates back in 2023. So both, the 2022 final tax payments, as well as the estimated 2023 tax payments were delayed into the second half of the year. This year, we're right back on target. So year-over-year, that's a bad guy. This year, it was a good guy last year. That's $200 million right there. So I probably just walked you through the vast majority of that operating cash flow deficit you are talking about. We're very comfortable in the cash flow characteristics of the business. And again, look over any broader period of time, you'll see a great normalization in that relationship between OCF and net income. On the Medicare risk adjustment, a couple of comments there. Unlike Marketplace, most of that Medicare was a benefit from this year's operations, and gosh, we're just getting a little bit better at it. We've got a bigger business. We've got the bright business, and sure, there's always some prior year benefit. But a lot of this is, we're just getting better at the risk adjustment equation across each of our individual Medicare businesses. Sure. On the second half of OCF, a normal relationship is a little bit ahead of net income. So, think a relationship of 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, something like that. I would expect a more normalized relationship in the second half of the year. Again, looking over the two years in total, so much of that year-over-year comparison was about things unique to last year or unique to this year. Looking at \u201823, \u201824 combined, you'll get a very normal relationship between OCF and net income that'll certainly normalize in the second half of this year. Sure. A couple of things there. So you are mentioning the California negative retro rate adjustment. Look, I haven't personally seen one. That's the only one. I don't expect another one, but for the rest of the year, there's not speculation. Those rate increases that Joe and I talked about in the second half of the year, both the normal rate cycle and the off cycle rates, all of those are known and committed, so not a lot of speculation there. On the 200 basis points that you are talking about of historical, you can't really think about corridors on a quarterly basis, because they are an annual fiscal year concept. So you are always accruing to an ultimate, which means you are spreading out any impact across all four quarters, not quarter specific. So when I think about the full year and our fiscal year accounting, we said somewhere around half of the historical 200 is about what we think we're using. That's again a guess, and it will ultimately come down to the full year development of rates, trends, and our medical management."

            "name": "Joseph Zubretsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Today, we will provide you with updates on our reported financial results for the second quarter highlighted by $5.86 of earnings per share, which was in line with our expectations. An update on our full year 2024 guidance, which we reaffirm at $38 billion of premium revenue and at least $23.50 in earnings per share, and our growth initiatives and strategy for sustaining profitable growth. Let me start with our second quarter performance. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.86 a $9.4 billion of premium revenue. Our 88.6% consolidated MCR reflects disciplined medical cost management despite experiencing some modest medical cost pressure. We produced a 4.6% adjusted pre-tax margin or 3.5% after-tax, a very strong result that is in the middle of our long-term target range. Year-to-date, our consolidated MCR is also 88.6%, and our adjusted pre-tax margin is 4.5%, both within our long-term target ranges. Our well-balanced portfolio of businesses and focusing on managing medical costs continue to produce results in line with our expectations. In Medicaid, the business produced a second quarter MCR of 90.8%, above our long-term target range. This quarter included a one-time prior year retroactive premium item in our California business. Excluding this one-time item, the second quarter MCR was 90.1%, elevated by higher MCRs from our new store additions, a dynamic consistent with the first quarter. It also reflects slightly higher than expected medical costs in the legacy Medicaid portfolio, attributable to the ongoing acuity shift of redeterminations. We continue to have risk- corridor protection in many geographies and expect that this medical cost pressure will be adequately captured by known rate adjustments in the second half of 2024. We expect our Medicaid results to improve in the second half of the year. Several data points indicate we are well on track in this regard. First, the California retro rate item will not repeat. Second, our new store addition results will continue to improve as they did in the second quarter. Third, we received rates in many states for the second half of 2024 that were in line with first half developing cost trends. Approximately 35% of our Medicaid premium revenue renews in the second half. Combined with several off-cycle adjustments, these account for the expected legacy Medicaid MCR improvement through the remainder of the year. Then, with approximately 55% of our Medicaid premium revenue scheduled to renew on January 1, our rate cycle cadence is well timed for early 2025. Providing upside to our outlook for the balance of the year would be continued success with rate advocacy initiatives that could provide positive off-cycle rate adjustments. Turning to Medicare, our second quarter reported MCR was 84.9%, representing better than expected performance across all our Medicare products, primarily due to favorable risk adjustment results as well as benefit adjustments implemented for 2024. Our newly acquired Bright business in California is performing in line with expectations, and we remain confident in ultimately delivering the full one-rate accretion of $1 per share. Our strategy of leveraging our existing Medicaid footprint to serve high-acuity, low-income Medicare beneficiaries is working well. In Marketplace, the second quarter MCR was 71.6%. This business performed better than our expectations, even as we saw higher special enrollment period membership gains from redeterminations. Our mix of renewing members, prior year pricing actions, and improved risk adjustment results position us well to continue to profitably grow this book of business. Turning now to our guidance for the full year. We remain confident in delivering our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $23.50, or 13% year-over-year growth. Strong net investment income and known rates will offset the one-time retro premium item and the second quarter pressure experienced in Medicaid. Performance in our core business remains strong, and we expect second half improvements to be driven by known on and off-cycle rate increases and new store MCRs reverting to target. Our guidance also includes our Florida and Virginia contracts extending through year end. Our full year premium revenue remains unchanged at approximately $38 billion or 17% year-over-year growth. Our 2024 revenue and earnings per share guidance provide a strong foundation for profitable growth in 2025 and beyond, and the building blocks to get there remain intact. Now some comments on our growth initiatives. Our business is well positioned to capitalize on unique long-term growth opportunities in all three segments. First, a few comments on our recently announced acquisition of ConnectiCare from EmblemHealth. ConnectiCare currently serves approximately 140,000 members with $1.4 billion in annual premium revenue. This is a well-diversified government sponsored healthcare play, which serves primarily Marketplace and Medicare membership in Connecticut. Historically, our strategy has been to establish these core product lines only in our pre-existing Medicaid footprint to leverage our Medicaid infrastructure. While that option is not available to us in Connecticut, a Medicaid fee-for-service state, we believe this is a great opportunity to execute the time-tested Molina M&A playbook. Acquire a stable revenue stream in our core products, deploy capital efficiently, and improve the assets' performance in the proven and reliable Molina way. We expect this acquisition to provide earnings accretion of $1 in earnings per share, which is now added to our embedded earnings. Our M&A pipeline remains full of many actionable opportunities. In Medicaid, we remain confident in winning new and renewal business contracts. Some comments on recent developments. In Florida, we were recently awarded a contract that successfully retains our foothold in the state. We will retain our 52,000 Medicaid members in the Miami-Dade region. In addition, by agreement, we will grow to approximately 90,000 members through preferential auto assignment. We estimate the annual premium revenue of $500 million. In Wisconsin, we successfully defended our LTSS position as the state announced its intent to award Molina a contract to provide services in Region 5, the first of a series of regional reprocurements. Additionally, we were just re-awarded our sole contract position in the IRIS Self Directed Personal Care program. In Georgia, while we await the award announcement, we remain confident as to our prospects and believe that we are well positioned to serve that state's Medicaid population. Finally, there was significant market opportunity out for bid over the next three years. This includes the Texas STAR Kids RFP, which represents a meaningful opportunity in a state where we have demonstrated recent success. In Medicare, we remain sharply focused on further penetration of low-income, high-acuity dual-eligible populations and on our high-acuity MAPD population in California. The new CMS rules on Medicare and Medicaid integration position us well to attract dual-eligible members over the coming years, as our footprint combines both products in most of our states, enabling a fully integrated member experience. We are in the process of further developing our suite of integrated duals products, and we will soon be establishing a new dedicated organization to lead this effort. In Marketplace, we are positioned to grow organically in underpenetrated markets, given the stabilized risk profile and margins we've achieved. We believe our rate filings for 2025 make us very competitive in underpenetrated geographies and position us well to grow. As a reminder, our growth outlook in this business can be simply stated as grow at a rate that allows us to sustain mid-single digit pre-tax margins. We are confident in our ability to grow organically, win new state contracts, and execute our M&A strategy. These remain consistent pillars of our growth strategy, and we expect to meet our target of $46 billion of premium revenue in 2026. With our 2024 earnings per share guidance of at least $23.50 reaffirmed, and with our embedded earnings outlook of $5, we remain committed to delivering on our long-term earnings per share growth targets. As Mark will describe shortly, the building blocks to get there are intact. In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter 2024 financial performance. The Medicare and Marketplace businesses significantly outperformed, while Medicaid is on track to improve in the second half of the year through known rate increases and continuing new store MCR improvements. In the meantime, we continue to focus on executing on the fundamentals, which has been the hallmark of our financial performance. The unprecedented redetermination process, which will be a 24-month journey from beginning to end, has presented some challenges that we have successfully navigated. But nothing has occurred during this period that changes our view that these are attractive businesses for the near and long-term, and profitable growth can and will be sustained. In fact, our results demonstrate that the principle of rate soundness works in that Molina's unique rate corridor position protects against transient quarter-to-quarter fluctuations of rates and medical costs. Finally, we look forward to updating you on our outlook for sustaining profitable growth at an Investor Day event on Friday, November 8th in New York City. As in past years, we will provide you with our detailed playbook for achieving our growth targets and maintaining industry-leading margins. We will outline our long-term goals and how we will achieve them with the transparency and specificity that you have come to expect from us. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. A.J. on your second question related to \u2013 I'm sorry. Please, go ahead. Say it again A.J. A.J., I think we lost you, but let me take your second question related to medical cost trends in the business. In Medicaid, as always, you see pockets of utilization increases in various geographies and in various healthcare categories. We see some pockets of skilled nursing facility cost increases, hours in home-based care. BH is spiking in a couple of geographies, but nothing we've never seen before. Pharmacy trend to high-cost drugs in the GLP-1s, certainly putting some cost pressure on the system. But again, nothing out of the ordinary and nothing that can't be dealt with, particularly as our corridor position absorbs these trends and then rates kick in to pick up the slack. It was a little bit higher than normal, but not worse than we expected in the first quarter. The pressure is isolated. It's various healthcare cost categories in various of our individual health plans. And Mark covered this in his prepared remarks. Sometimes it's overlooked. We've been routinely over the past four years, paying into the risk corridors at minimum MLRs to the extent of about 200 basis points inside our NCR, which basically means if you are reporting an 88, you are performing at an 86, which gives you 200 basis points of cushion if a medical cost should inflect for any reason, whether it's an acuity shift or whether it's normal trend. So we see pockets of utilization increases as I described, in various categories, in various plans, but largely picked up by the corridors and mid-cycle rate increases and on-cycle rate increases, particularly in the second half of the year where 35% of our revenue renews in the second half. We've heard the discussion about over-utilizing in advance of losing coverage. We have not experienced that. Our leavers are leaving at the same MCR from the beginning of the redetermination process to the end. No change and no indication that they are using services in advance particularly, because in the termination process, many of them don't know that they've been redetermined. So they don't have any advance notice. They are just off the Medicaid rolls. They weren't using services and now they are off through the redetermination process. So we haven't seen that. I'll take the last part of that first Josh on marketplace. Clearly running at 72 for the first half and predicting 78 for the back half seems to be a push. But be mindful of the fact that SEP membership is quite high and those members are coming in at higher utilization rates than the existing membership. And then of course you have the natural seasonality of the business. Now, you are absolutely right. Last year, we actually invested margin in growth and we grew at $1 billion to $1.2 billion of revenue this year. Where we're running this year, we think we're at par. We think we're right in the single-digit land, but we could. You could see us be a little more aggressive on growth next year and try to grow this business as we did in 2024 over \u201823. So the margin position is solid. And again, our growth rate is going to be determined by our ability to produce mid-single-digit margins, just given the inherent volatility that exists in the business itself. Correct, and I think there'll be enough strength that we pointed out otherwise in the business to more than overcome that 30-bip increase. So I think we're in good shape. Well, Mark gave you the numbers in the prepared remarks that are actual in the last four years. We have been paying in to the corridors to the extent of 200 basis points, contributing to the Medicaid MCR, 200 basis points. We said at the beginning of the redetermination process, we said this repeatedly, that the corridors were going to act as a financial buffer until such times rates pick up the slack, which is exactly what's happening. So yes, suffice it to say, this year our corridor liability isn't 200 basis points. We've used some of it to cushion the results, but some of it does remain in various geographies in a meaningful way. Now, the other point to make on the corridors is they don't just disappear forever. They replenish at the next rate cycle, whatever the state fiscal year is. And so if you could actually sound rates at the next rate cycle and you continue to relatively outperform that benchmark, you are back into the corridors and you are recreating that 200 basis points of cushion. On the PYD point -- I'll kick it to Mark, but the first point to make before which lines of business did it affect. Most of it, if not nearly all of it, was picked up by prior year corridors. Mark, do you want to take it? And your question related to the exchanges, everybody's got models. We see models in the industry. We have our own models in terms of what would happen if the enhanced subsidies are in fact, do expire. And there's industry estimates we have our own. You look at the level of subsidies, you look at your FPL cohorts, and you can argue that 10%, 20% of membership could be affected and priced out of your silver product, but then again, you have a lower priced bronze product, perhaps sitting right next to it. So how many of those are going to recapture into one of your bronze products, a little priced hard to say. But we've seen industry estimates of 10% to 20%, and then the wild card is if you have a bronze product sitting alongside your silver product in a certain geography, will you recapture some of that in bronze? And Stephen, we have very detailed models. We have an entire accounting system on NIM and MLR and corridor tracking. And one of the reasons we don't give specific numbers generally is if 50% or 75% of your premium has a corridor, you say, well, it's protected. Well, it's only protected if that's where the medical cost deterioration happens. And so looking at the gross number can just be very, very misleading. We have our arms around it. We know where we're protected. We know where we have upside opportunity and some geographies there's upside opportunity depending on where you are in the corridor. So we generally don't like to give specific numbers on how much premium is protected, because I think it gives a false positive. It is possible that if we're redoing that projection right now, it would have to be a little more influenced by M&A, just given where we are in the reprocurement cycle, but we're very active in the M&A space as we just demonstrated. Yeah, comments have been made that the last two transactions that we executed were Medicare and marketplace, which some people are calling non-core. They are core. They are as core as Medicaid. And our pipeline is still very active with Medicaid opportunities, and you'll hopefully see Medicaid transactions here over the next 12 to 18 months. We're still very active in that space. The last two we did were non-Medicaid, but that doesn't mean we're not actively pursuing them and working them. And Scott, on the Connecticare acquisition, the business performs okay. It does not perform to Molina target margins. As typical in these situations, we intend to improve the MCRs in both, the marketplace business and the Medicare business, and rationalize the G&A spend. It is not a huge undertaking. As I said, they are underperforming our targets, but not woefully underperforming. We will improve the performance by moving these simply from where they are to Molina targets. Pay per membership, good brand recognition. We bought it at 25% of revenue, half of which is hard capital. And then we unleashed the Molina playbook to get it to our target margins, the dollar of accretion. Great deal for us."

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Jeffrey Geyer. Please go ahead. \nJeffrey Geyer: Good morning, and welcome to Molina Healthcare's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Molina's President and CEO, Joe Zubretsky; and our CFO, Mark Keim. A press release announcing our first quarter 2024 earnings was distributed after the market closed yesterday and is available on our Investor Relations website. Shortly after the conclusion of this call, a replay will be available for 30 days. The numbers to access the replay are in the earnings release. For those of you who listen to the rebroadcast of this presentation, we remind you that all of the remarks are made as of today, Thursday, April 25, 2024, and have not been updated subsequent to the initial earnings call. \n On this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the first quarter 2024 earnings release. During the call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our 2024 guidance, Medicaid redeterminations, our recent RFP awards and related revenue growth, our recent acquisitions and M&A activity, our long-term growth strategy, our embedded earnings power and future earnings realization and our Medicare business performance in 2025. \n Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors, discussed in our Form 10-K annual report filed with the SEC as well as our risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filings with the SEC. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Joe Zubretsky. Joe? \nJoseph Zubretsky: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Today, I will cover our traditional quarterly topics, our reported financial results for the first quarter, which were in line with our expectations, highlighted by $5.73 of earnings per share. An update on our guidance, which we reaffirm at $38 billion of premium revenue and at least $23.50 in earnings per share and an update on our growth initiatives, which in the quarter were mixed, but we are maintaining our $4 per share estimate of embedded earnings and our long-term growth outlook. \n Let me start with our first quarter performance. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.73, a $9.5 billion of premium revenue, supported by excellent operating metrics across all lines of business. Our 88.5% consolidated MCR reflects continued strong medical cost management with all 3 segments reporting MCRs, in line with our expectations. We produced a 4.5% adjusted pretax margin or 3.4% after tax, a very strong result that is in the middle of our long-term target range. \n In Medicaid, we continue to deliver strong operating margins while growing our franchise as the business produced a first quarter MCR of 89.7%. Our expanded platform in California and our new Nebraska health plan, together, added over 0.5 million members and along with our new store additions in late 2023, drove an increase in the MCR above our long-term target range, but in line with our quarterly expectations. We believe we have now experienced approximately 90% of the Medicaid redetermination impact. \n The acuity shift unfolded as we predicted and appears to have stabilized in most of our markets. Rate changes, both on cycle and off-cycle largely offset the security shift with risk corridors capturing any temporary shortfall. Medicaid rates remain actuarially sound with 19 states that represent over 95% of our revenue, providing acuity-related rate adjustments within 2024. Turning to Medicare. Our first quarter reported MCR was 88.7%, our performance in line with our expectations. The higher utilization we experienced in the second half of 2023 due to higher LTSS costs and pharmacy utilization continued into 2024. But the operational improvements and supplemental benefit adjustments to be made in our legacy business have thus far proven to be successful. \n Our first quarter experience of the newly acquired Bright Medicare plans provides us with confidence in our turnaround plan to deliver the embedded earnings. Our strategy of leveraging our existing Medicaid footprint to serve high acuity, low-income Medicare beneficiaries is working well. In Marketplace, the first quarter MCR was 73.3% and in line with our expectations. \n Our membership mix comprised 50% renewal members and 70% of members in our silver product. Strong renewals gives us keen insight into the acuity of our membership base. We continue to expect this business to grow throughout the year as the Medicaid redetermination process provides a great opportunity to capture membership during the special enrollment period. Turning now to our guidance for the full year. Based on our consolidated first quarter results, we reaffirm our full year 2024 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $23.50 or 13% year-over-year growth. Our full year premium revenue remains unchanged at approximately $38 billion or 17% year-over-year growth. \n While we are seeing increased underlying strength in our core business, we are maintaining our full year guidance to account for any potential earnings headwind in the second half of the year from potential contract losses in Virginia and Florida. Our 2024 revenue and EPS guidance provides a strong foundation for profitable growth in 2025 and beyond. Now some comments on our growth initiatives. In Medicaid, we had mixed success in the quarter. We were awarded a large RFP win in Texas and a large reprocurement win in Michigan, but we're not awarded contracts in 2 other existing states, Virginia and Florida. All these impacts combined caused no net change to our embedded earnings, which remains at $4 per share. \n Let me provide some commentary on these RFP outcomes. In Texas, the state announced its intent to award us all 7 of our preferred service areas as part of the STAR and CHIP programs. This contract is expected to begin in September 2025 and last for 6 years with the option to extend up to an additional 6 years. The award expands our footprint and increases our market share. We successfully defended our position in Michigan and were awarded a contract in 6 regions. While these regions represent 93% of our current membership, the award reduced the number of payers in many of our retained regions and thus, we expect to grow our market share. \n We were very disappointed with the outcome in the Virginia RFP, but we are exercising our right to challenge this decision. We were also disappointed with the RFP result in Florida, but history has shown that the ultimate outcome there could be more favorable. We will continue to refine our membership, revenue and embedded earnings estimates as we gain clarity on the new contracts, our expanding market share and the unwinding of any lost revenue. Now with respect to future growth initiatives, our growth pipeline remains replete with opportunity. \n Regarding RFPs, many opportunities remain with over $60 billion of premium opportunity up for bid over the next 3 years. This includes in-flight RFP bids in 2 states, Kansas and Georgia, and a projected near-term RFP in North Carolina. The Texas STAR Kids program is likely going to RFP soon, where we now have a very strong statewide presence and great momentum. We remain confident in our ability to win new state contracts and deliver clinical and financial outcomes that align with the needs of our state partners. Although this quarter's RFP results were mixed, since we began our growth strategy, we are 7 for 9 in reprocurements and 8 for 10 in new business procurements. This track record gives us great confidence in our strategy and our continued ability to drive growth. \n With respect to M&A initiatives, our acquisition pipeline contains many actionable opportunities. We have executed 8 transactions totaling $11 billion in revenue over the past 4 years, and M&A will continue to be a key component of our strategy. Next, as we look forward into 2025, 2 comments about the outlook for our Medicare portfolio. First, our Medicare product profile has different characteristics than mainstream MAPD business. Our business is a combination of legacy D-SNP, MNP demonstrations and our newly acquired Bright business. With this lineup of products, factors such as rate setting, bidding and revenue drivers do matter, but to a lesser extent. \n Second, the product portfolio is well positioned to contribute to our growth. Our penetration in dual eligible populations, high acuity and dual income will benefit from further integration of Medicare and Medicaid benefits. BMS recently announced rules to closely align dual-eligible populations with Medicaid MCOs, which means our Medicaid footprint will be a growth catalyst for attracting and retaining dual-eligible membership. \n With our 2024 guidance reaffirmed, we remain committed to delivering on our long-term premium and earnings per share growth earnings. With all of the successful growth activity in M&A in new and expanded contracts, even considering the potential for contract losses or reductions, we maintain our embedded earnings outlook at $4 per share. Mark will provide insight on the components in a moment, but the majority is still expected to emerge in 2025. \n In summary, we are very pleased with our first quarter 2024 financial and operating performance. That performance, combined with our successful track record for producing top line revenue keeps us on track for sustaining profitable growth consistent with our long-term targets. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark? \nMark Keim: Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss additional details on our first quarter performance, the balance sheet, our 2024 guidance and thoughts on embedded earnings. Beginning with our first quarter results. For the quarter, we reported approximately $10 billion in total revenue and $9.5 billion of premium revenue with adjusted EPS of $5.73. Our first quarter consolidated MCR was 88.5% and reflect continued strong medical cost management. \n The change health care outage did not materially impact quarterly results, and all of our segments reported MCRs in line with our expectations. In Medicaid, our first quarter reported MCR was 89.7% as expected, the new store additions in California and Nebraska as well as Iowa and the My Choice Wisconsin acquisition in late 2023 drove a higher reported MCR in the first quarter. Recall, we have added approximately 800,000 Medicaid members in the past 3 quarters, and these new store members typically experience higher MLRs in the early stages. \n Across our Medicaid business, the major medical cost categories were largely in line with our expectations and the normal quarter-to-quarter trend of fluctuations within our guidance. In Medicare, our first quarter reported MCR was 88.7%, in line with our expectations. Higher LTSS costs and pharmacy utilization continued in our legacy business but were somewhat offset by the operational improvements and benefit adjustments that we implemented for 2024. \n Segment results now include the newly acquired Bright plans with initial performance as expected. In Marketplace, our first quarter reported MCR was 73.3%, and we are pleased with the high renewal rates and significant silver membership composition. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7.1%, as expected, reflecting operating discipline and the continued benefit of fixed cost leverage as we grow our business. Moving on to Medicaid redeterminations. In the quarter, we estimated a net loss of 50,000 members due to redeterminations. This was on track with our expectations and brings the total net loss from redetermination since its inception to 550,000. \n We estimate that our membership is approximately 90% of the way through the redetermination process. We expect to lose another 50,000 members in the second quarter, the last quarter of pandemic-related redeterminations to reach our total estimated net loss of 600,000. Our reconnect rate was 30%. We expect this rate to remain near 30% in the second quarter. And of course, some of the reconnect benefit will continue into the third quarter and beyond. We continue to see strong marketplace SEP membership growth as Medicaid members losing eligibility moved to Molina Marketplace products. \n Turning to our balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. On January 1, we closed the Bright acquisition at a final price of approximately $425 million, funded with cash on hand. In the quarter, we harvested approximately $110 million of subsidiary dividends, bringing our parent company cash balance to $194 million at the end of the quarter. Debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged and 1.4x trailing 12-month EBITDA with our debt-to-cap ratio at about 35%. \n These ratios reflect our low leverage position and ample cash and capital capacity for additional growth and investment. In the quarter, both S&P and Moody's upgraded our credit ratings based on our low debt, stable earnings profile and high transparency. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 49% and consistent with prior quarters. While the Change Healthcare outage impacted our February operations with claims 20% lower than normal, we're pleased to report that our quick response through alternative clearing houses restored claims and payments to near normal levels in March. \n Given the mid-quarter disruption, we have been appropriately prudent and are confident in the strength of our reserve position. Next, a few comments on our 2024 guidance. As Joe mentioned, we reaffirm our full year guidance with premium revenue of approximately $38 billion. Our revenue guidance remains unchanged as we work with state partners to understand the timing and impact of any contract losses in Virginia and Florida. Our full year consolidated MCR is unchanged at 88.2%. Medical cost trends are in line with expectations across all businesses, and we remain appropriately conservative in our outlook on utilization and acuity trends at this stage in the year. \n We continue to expect full year EPS of at least $23.50 per share. We see underlying strength in our core business. However, we are maintaining our full year guidance of recognizing any potential earnings headwinds in the second half of the year from potential contract losses in Virginia and Florida. Looking ahead to 2025, a few observations on our Medicare portfolio. The CMS final rate notice for Medicare Advantage has received a lot of attention. For Molina, it's important to note that only 2/3 of our Medicare segment revenue or only 10% of total enterprise revenue is fully subject to these rates. With a heavy concentration in California, we yielded a more favorable rate profile than CMS national averages. The remaining 1/3 of our Medicare segment, the MMP demonstrations received rates determined by CMS and our state partners, which continue to be appropriately commensurate with cost trends. \n We remain confident that the rate environment and our product profile will position us to grow our Medicare business profitably. The integration of our recent Bright acquisition is off to a great start. Recall that we are expecting modest dilution from Bright this year. We expect an improvement to break even in 2025 and then full run rate accretion of $1 EPS in 2026. Looking at our Medicare segment from a different perspective. \n As Joe mentioned earlier, we believe that the recent CMS 2025 final role, strategically advantaged us to grow. Currently, many dual eligible members received their medicated Medicare benefits from 2 different MCOs. CMS announced rules that will move these unaligned dual members to the D-SNP plan run by their Medicaid MCO. As such, incumbent Medicaid players will see increased growth opportunities in D-SNP. While the new rule will phase in over time, it's clear that our substantial Medicaid footprint positions us well to grow our D-SNP product to serve due eligible members. This shift, along with demand from state partners to service these complex populations gives us confidence, our Medicare portfolio will meet our long-term growth and margin targets. \n Turning to embedded earnings. We continue to guide to $4 of new store embedded earnings as we now expect approximately $0.80 from the new contract win in Texas incepting next year to be offset by our best estimate of next year's impact of the Virginia and Florida potential losses. We expect the majority of this new store embedded earnings to emerge in 2025 with the remainder in 2026. giving us further confidence in our 15% to 18% long-term growth rate for EPS. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Kyle Sternick with JPMorgan. \nKyle Kristick: I guess, first, I wanted to start on the guidance here, is -- you talked about the strength in the core business and the MCR sort of being in line with your expectations. So I guess, is the right way to think that the strength is really coming from G&A? And then when we think about the back half is -- I guess, is the outperformance in the current business enough to allow you to maintain guidance? Or if you think about the -- those potential contracts going away, are there additional SG&A savings you'd need to target in the back half to be able to offset those losses? Just any color to help us frame that would be great. \nJoseph Zubretsky: Okay. We are clearly saying that if we have a revenue loss in the third and fourth quarters due to the contract losses and the related earnings, the strength of the core business will produce enough earnings power to offset that. And it's no one thing. It's just general performance of all our portfolios. The loss ratios in our Medicaid and Medicare business get better as the year progresses for a variety of reasons.\n Obviously, in marketplace, it's higher in the back half due to the normal seasonality of that business. But there is 90 basis points of improvement projected in the Medicaid of MCRs in the last 3 quarters of the year and 90 basis points of improvement in the Medicare MCRs in the second, third and fourth quarters. So it's just general performance of the business. The seasonality happens for a variety of reasons, general strength of the business to offset any potential earnings drag from potentially lost contracts. \nKyle Kristick: Got it. And then I wanted to ask about the SNP regs as well. Specifically, how does that change your strategic thinking about M&A. I mean, I think the bright deal is really the first big Medicare asset begun purchased. Does this change the way you think about whether you'd be more biased towards MA or Medicaid? Or is it really just more motivation to sort of double down on the organic growth? . \nJoseph Zubretsky: It doesn't really change our M&A strategy. I mean we look for opportunities across all of [indiscernible], most of our M&A activity has been in Medicaid, but the Bright acquisition represents first M&A opportunity that we actioned in Medicare. But what we're really saying is the fact that we have this 20-state footprint in Medicaid and growing. The decent opportunity is just one more way to monetize your significant Medicaid footprint. And the fact that we have a very robust and very operationally excellent decent business. Those 2 platforms combined will allow us to participate in the duly eligible population growth rate that's going to happen here over the next number of years. So we're very, very pleased with the final rule that came out from CMS, which basically says that Medicaid will be the anchor tenant for action in the dual eligible population. \nOperator: The next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. \nJoshua Raskin: Just to go back on the Virginia and Florida. I heard the $0.80 from Texas and then the offset Virginia, Florida. Is that $0.80 an annual number? And is it, say, $0.40, $0.45 for 2024 specifically? And then just a second question on the M&A pipeline, a follow-up there as well. I'm curious if your experience with the acquisition of Bright and then the 2025 rate update. Has that changed the way you thought about Medicare Advantage? \nJoseph Zubretsky: I'll kick it to Mark for the question on the Florida and Virginia earnings. Go ahead. \nMark Keim: On Virginia and Florida, just to set the stage, we think right now, that's about a $2 billion revenue run rate and about $1.10 on EPS full year. Now the simplifying assumption is we lose both in the fourth quarter, the headwind would be $0.5 billion on revenue and $0.30. But look, we're still working that through. Those are under protest and exactly what the timing is, is somewhat unclear. But if you deposit that assumption, it would be a $0.30 component to this year's guidance. which, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, is offset by the underlying strength of the business. So if the full run rate is $1.10, we recognized $0.30 this year, what's left is $0.80 for embedded earnings. -- and that is exactly offset by the $0.80 of accretion we see in STAR and CHIP. \nJoseph Zubretsky: Josh,and your second question related to Bright now that we've owned the business for a full quarter, we are very optimistic and confident in the $1 of ultimate accretion. The way to think about that business is actually very simple. Operationally breakeven in year 1 with a slight earnings drag related to the carrying costs, breakeven in your -- operationally breakeven in year 2. And full $1 accretion in year 3 and we get there by -- we inherited a 95% MCR in the business. We've managed it to 87%. We inherited a 13% G&A ratio in the business. We managed to 8%, that's 1,300 basis points of turnaround, which on $1.6 billion of revenue would show you how we get to the full accretion. \n The G&A savings will likely happen sooner as we need to go through 2 pricing cycles to get the MCR down to 87%. But now that we've owned it for a quarter and have excellent line of sight to the operating metrics and the dynamics of the business we're very confident in producing that portion of our embedded earnings. \nOperator: And the next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. \nStephen Baxter: Two questions for you. Just first, I was hoping you could potentially spike out the new store Medicaid impact to MLR? And then when you think about the 90 basis point improvement that you're talking about, how much of that is normal seasonality versus maybe new store coming down or maybe just getting back some of the last bit of acuity adjustment? And then the second question is just on the Medicaid deal pipeline. I think your last announcement on that front? I know they still take a long time to close was in July, I think, 2022. I was just wondering if you could give us an update on the pipeline there? And it seems like maybe there's been some slowdown maybe as reformation distribution, maybe it's now just kind of hear when you think about the pipeline in Medicaid over the next 6 to 12 months. \nJoseph Zubretsky: Stephen, I'll answer the first question first and then kick it to Mark on the Medicaid MCR. The Medicaid MCR of 89.7% in the quarter was as expected and heavily influenced by 20% of the member month volume in the quarter was on new business, either new business that came in from California and Nebraska on [ 11 ] or our -- second half of our Iowa contract from 2023 in the My Choice acquisition. That new business runs in the '90s. So you can do the math. That created pressure on the Medicaid MCR in the first quarter. \n As we work through the Molina playbook, operational improvements across all the dimensions of managed care, that performance improves, second, third and fourth quarter, which really creates a very different tilt to the way the earnings pattern is emerging this year versus prior years. It starts out high and improved throughout the year. As I said, the MCRs in the last few quarters are 90 basis points better than the first and we're still on target to hit 89% in our full year guidance on Medicaid, which is at the top end of our long-term target range. Mark? \nMark Keim: Stephen, I'd just add to that. A year ago, our Medicaid MCR was 88.4%. This quarter, the legacy NCR was very close to that. So as Joe mentioned, coming out at 89.7% is a function of that new store MCR, which comes in hot. And recall, we said that this year, margins and earnings were a little bit back-end loaded consistent with our expectations. We came out really right where we expected. On the deal pipeline, I wouldn't say it slowed down. It's always fits and starts. What's most important to Joe and I is we constantly have a pipeline of advanced stage discussions. \n Sometimes they're banker processes, but just as often, they're one-off bespoke discussions, relationship development where we're out selling the Molina story, which is very appealing to many not-for-profits. So we've got a good pipeline of both if we could waive our wand and time them exactly where we want it, you might have seen one this quarter. But look, we are always hopeful that the pipeline is developing. We like what we see. So stay tuned on that. \nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. \nKevin Fischbeck: Can you talk a little bit about how redeterminations are going, both from the Medicaid and the exchange side of things. It sounds like you're 90% done, but you still expect strong growth on the exchanges. I guess when should that tailwind kind of be fully into the numbers? And then on the Medicaid side, you talked about a 30% recapture rate. Just trying to see any details about the acuity of that population. \nJoseph Zubretsky: I'll start off and then I'll kick it to Mark, but just to recap the entire redetermination process from start to finish. We estimate that at the high of the PHE, we have grown 1 million members due to the pause in the redetermination process. We are now projecting to lose 600,000 of those, 550,000 lost to date, another 50,000 in the second quarter. we have been experiencing a 30% reconnect rate. And once the redetermination process stops, that reconnect rate will continue on into the late spring and perhaps even into the summer. \n We are seeing a significant increase in our special enrollment in marketplace. Now whether you're coming in from Medicaid or not is a self-reporting feature. So we don't have exact statistics on how many are coming from other companies' Medicaid roles. But we've been averaging 12,000 to 15,000 SEP members in prior quarters, and that's double. It's up to 30,000 hour, which is obviously being heavily influenced by members coming off of Medicaid into marketplace. Mark, anything to add? \nMark Keim: Yes. If you look at our marketplace, we reported 346,000 members in the first quarter. We'll go to 370,000 per our original guidance. That's unchanged. And that's on the continued strength of folks coming in from redeterminations, which is obviously an anomaly this year. Remember, Marketplace always had normal lapses through the year. So typically, marketplace volumes declined through the year. in this case, will increase through the year to our guidance of 370,000.I think you asked about the reconnect rate. We're still seeing 30% on reconnects coming back in. And both the folks coming in to marketplace as well as the reconnects, we're not seeing an anomaly on the MORs that would really change our outlook for the year. So pretty much right on track, Kevin, right where we want to be. . \nOperator: And the next question comes from A.J Rice with UBS. \nAlbert Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe just to follow on that last train of thought, but a little different focus. Obviously, as we move into next year, you'll have given the redeterminations will subside as we get through the summer.  you'll have the full impact of whatever change on the acuity risk pool there is, for legacy, people to stay on the Medicaid. When you sort of look at that at this early date, you got -- you signaled that you got these decent rate increases proactively in 17 states this year. Do you need a second year, do you think, of above-average rate increases when that acuity is fully reflected in the run rate for all of next year? \n And what is the timing on knowing whether you're getting adequate rate increases for next year? \nJoseph Zubretsky: Let me recap where we are in the rate environment, and then I'll kick it to Mark for some more color. We couldn't be more pleased with the way our state customers have responded to having rates be commensurate with normal cost trends and trends that have been influenced by the acuity shift. We received acuity-related adjustments in 19 states, representing 95% of our revenue. We had 5 retroactive rate adjustments, and we're actually anticipating perhaps 4 more. So the states have been very responsive and rates have been actual really sound. \n Look, we're guiding to the top end of our MCR rate for the entire year at 89%, and that's with 2 very unprecedented phenomenon going on in the book of business. One is the unprecedented shift in the national [indiscernible] due to the redetermination process, and the other is bringing on 800,000 new members that committed higher MCRs. With those 2 found on influencing how medical costs emerge, producing an MCR at the high end of our long-term range is something we're very, very pleased with. \n The answer is no. We expect rates next year to be actually sound, we expect them to be commensurate with the medical cost trends we're experiencing, fee schedule increases, benefits carved in and out, that's the normal process, and we have every reason to believe that rates will be actually sound going into next year. Mark, anything to add? \nMark Keim: You mentioned the rate increase is kind of proactive, there probably more reactive, right, as so many of the states react to observe trends as opposed to proactively put it in. I wish they did. But as Joe mentioned, we're okay with the rate increases for this year. The rate increases we've seen look like they match the trend we're expecting. In we saw the acuity impact on trend really level off. And I think that's commensurate with the volume. So far, we've had 550,000 members leave only 50,000 were in this last quarter. So it's really leveled off. \n And we've seen a similar impact with the reAcquity-- redebt acuity impact here. So right now, I'd say rates look okay for the year. If they're not, the good news is 50% of our revenue comes up for new rates every January 1 which means if there's back half pressure this year, it's time really well for January 1 on the next rate cycle. \nAlbert Rice: Okay. And maybe if I could just ask on the Marketplace product. Obviously, the last 1, 1.5 years, you've been focused on repricing and margin. Now that you sort of have gotten that in place. Any update on your long-term strategy toward marketplace and growing that? Or what's your thought on that? \nJoseph Zubretsky: Sure. A.J., the small silver and stable strategy was a short-term reaction to having to re-position the business to maintain a profile of single digit -- mid-single digit pretax margins. That was a temporal way to look at the business. we invested about 300 basis points of what call excess margin from last year into the business this year, and that's why we're growing membership at 30% and premium revenues are growing at 20%. So we like the nice steady progression of the business. We do expect to grow it. But being in the insurance business as long as I have, you never try to grow any portfolio organically that quickly because when underwriting isn't allowed, which -- that's what this product is, you have to be very wary of where you're bidding against the market, who else is in the market and where your results are coming out for the prior year. So we're going to be cautious. But the nice steady growth we saw this year feels really good to us. We're able to maintain a profile of high single-digit pretax margins and grow at this rate I think that's what to expect. \nOperator: The next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. \nJustin Lake: A couple of questions here. First, last quarter, Joe, you mentioned an expectation that the company had visibility to grow EPS at the low end of your 15% to 18% outlook for 2025. Is that still the expectation? And then secondly, Joe, you mentioned that you're assuming in Texas or it looks like you're assuming in Texas that you get an average amount of share of the state from your new wins meaning there's 4 plants in a region, you get 25%.\n First, is that correct? And then second, what are the level of visibility here? The reason I ask is that your local regional market share in Medicaid varies pretty broadly by state across plans. Texas, your share currently appears to be in the high-single digits versus a state like Washington, where I recall you have way above average share. I'm just curious on your visibility on getting that. \nJoseph Zubretsky: Yes. Justin, the -- last quarter, we gave you the building blocks for an outlook into 2025, and we have not changed our view of those building blocks. Obviously, embedded earnings still at $4, we have actually changed the composition of that and how those emerge in upcoming years has changed slightly. But the building blocks haven't changed. We continue to harvest earnings out of our existing footprint. We talked about operating leverage, talk about embedded earnings. Obviously, there likely will be a natural headwind from interest rate declines into next year. So the building blocks haven't changed, and that's still our forward look for 2025, again, not guidance, but an outlook. On Texas, we don't know. We used very conservative estimates of what our market share would likely to be in the 7 regions that we won and use kind of the average portfolio margins. I don't think there's anything more to read into it than that. We think it's a conservative and reasonable estimate of what that business will produce. \nJustin Lake: So can you share that market share assumption? \nJoseph Zubretsky: I don't -- it's far too early, and we don't want to get ahead of our customer on that. So we'll wait and see until we have more visibility into how membership will be allocated. I think that's the prudent thing to do here. \nOperator: The next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. \nNathan Rich: I wanted to ask on Florida. Joe, I think you talked about the protests and the ultimate outcome could be different. I guess I'd be curious to get your view, Florida kind of shifted to more of a comprehensive care model in the state. And in your view, does that create, I guess, more friction than normal for the appeals process and potential changes there? And then as a follow-up, I wanted to ask if you had an updated view on the $46 billion revenue target by 2026.\n Obviously, that included some assumption for RFP wins, but there are a number of other factors in that bucket. So just curious if you still feel like that's the right shooting point for 2026 revenue. \nJoseph Zubretsky: In, on Florida, we're not making a prediction on how the process will unfold. We're citing historical precedent. Historical precedent would suggest that this is not the end, it's sort of the beginning of the end of the process. that there's more discussions that will take place. So I don't want to, again, get ahead of the state on this. But if you look at the past 2 procurements in Florida, there have been extended conversations and there are regions in Florida that still do not have maximum awards given. So again, just citing historical precedent. On the $46 billion of revenue, but we have a $60 billion new contract pipeline. Kansas and Georgia are sitting out there currently live and in process. as I mentioned, Texas STAR Kids. We have great momentum in the State of Texas. \n North Carolina, we didn't be down North Carolina last time because it was too early in our turnaround plan to bid on anything. So we're looking at the $60 billion pipeline and feeling pretty good about our prospects there. Look, we're for 7 for 9 reprocurements and we started our growth journey. We're 8 for 10 and new business wins. We have 8 M&A transactions totaling $1 billion of revenue over the past 4 years. We're feeling really good about the long-term revenue target here and our ability to produce continued 13% to 15% revenue growth and 15% to 18% earnings per share growth. Nothing's changed. And our trajectory here, even though we're disappointed with the 2 RFP situations in the second quarter -- in the first quarter. \nOperator: The next question comes from Gary Taylor with TD Calin. \nGary Taylor: I had 2 policy questions actually. One, just because I get asked a lot just about the expiring ACA credits for 2026, maybe leaving aside whether or not they get renewed and the politics of that. Just wondering, from a technical basis, how are you guys thinking about sort of elasticity of demand for exchange product, if some of the income level categories see a fairly material percentage change in the premium that would be required, just what you're thinking now, if end of the worst case, those went away. What the impact might be, how much is retained. \n And then the second question would just be the big Medicaid rule that was out earlier this week, managed care, Medicaid rule. I think we were primarily focused on the state-directed payments changes there, but I know there are a few things on MCO transparency, MLR reporting changes. I just wanted to see if there's anything that you felt was material to you going forward. \nJoseph Zubretsky: On the -- I believe your first question was on the enhanced subsidies for Marketplace. I understand it -- it's hard to say. -- bear in mind, they do go away unless legislation is passed to extend them. That's -- sometimes that's misunderstood. They are going away because the subsidy enhancement was temporary. and a less legislation is passed to extend them they will. \n Now I can go through all types of political scenarios and legislative scenarios. There's lots of people who think that, that can easily be given up for an extension of the Trump tax cuts. I'm not going to make any political conclusions here, but it's probably a 50-50 push on how that gets done and if it gets done. We did not grow significantly when those enhanced subsidies came in because our members, keep in mind, we leverage our Medicaid footprint. We go after highly subsidized, low-income members and we didn't benefit a lot by the enhanced subsidies as most of our membership was already very, very highly subsidized. So from our perspective, we're not looking at it as a huge issue for us in terms of membership loss. And that's the way I would answer the first part of your question. The second part had to do with which ruling. I want to make sure I understood your question. \nGary Taylor: The managed care, the Medicaid managed care access finance quality accrual that was out earlier this week. \nJoseph Zubretsky: Not significant. We're still analyzing it. We're obviously aware of it. We're analyzing it. lots of different features to it, many of which incept over very extended periods of time. So there's nothing to immediately react to. But nothing in that guideline changes of the long-term trajectory of the business. As I've said many times, I often asked, is there any political legislative or judicial environmental issue that causes you major concern on the viability of the businesses you're in. And the answer is no. The way the election comes out, whether Congress is split, whether things can get done vis-a-vis the 60 votes in the Senate needed to do something fundamental, the reconciliation process, et cetera. We don't -- we think the legislative and political scenarios are pretty neutral for the sustainability of the businesses we're in. \nMark Keim: Gary, the one thing I would point out is certainly when they streamline Medicaid and chip eligibility and all the procedural items that folks have to go through to maintain or get eligibility, it just makes it easier for the appropriate coverage to go to the right people, and we think that's obviously a good tailwind for our business. \nOperator: The next question comes from George Hill, Deutsche Bank. \nGeorge Hill: Joe, just a high-level question. One of your peers this week talked about a normalized individual MA margin of 3% or better. I know that your book of business is a little bit different. But I was just wondering if you guys would be willing to kind of speak to what you think the normalized margin profile of individual MA is and kind of how you think that varies between the D-SNP book and the individual book. And I know that you guys have a heavily subsidized population. So the book is a little bit different, but I appreciate any color. \nJoseph Zubretsky: Yes. Well, our target for our Medicare business is mid-single-digit pretax. I wasn't sure whether you're referring to pretax or after tax, our NCR range for the products we're in is 87% to 88%. As we said, we hope to get -- not hope. We're projecting to get right down to 87% here over the next couple of years. So we still target mid-single-digit pretax margins in this business. \n We like the D-SNP business not only can produce excellent profits, but monetizing our Medicaid footprint for dual eligible population here over time is going to be a significant growth category for us. So we're perfectly positioned, but at least we're well, well positioned to take advantage of the growth in the deorgible population here, and we still target mid-single-digit pretax margins, MCRs in the 87% to 88% range. \nMark Keim: George, the only thing I'd add is it's really hard to compare a Molina book of business to some of our big competitors in Medicare. Remember, we skew really heavily to the dual eligibles. So we've got an awful lot of our book in the high teens to $2,000 PMPMs, which are high acuity. If you're very good at managing medical costs -- there's a big opportunity on those high-dollar members to get to the margins that Joe talked about, even in the presence of some headwinds. So I think it's really hard to make that comparison to others. \nOperator: And the next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. \nScott Fidel: Two questions. The first one, just if you've gotten the scoring results yet from Florida and have been able to start to develop the factual points that may be the basis of your appeal in Florida is definitely interested in your thoughts on that? And then just second, on the HICS side, just if you want to refresh us at this point after seeing results so far, what you're expecting for full year MLR and pretax margin offer 2024 for the HICS business. \nJoseph Zubretsky: On these protest processes, I think I've said about all I really should say about them. They are legal processes, and we have to see how they unfold. But of course, through various requests, I'm sure everybody's got the information they need to document their findings and to put their case forward. So that's all I'll say about it. \n Your last question was about market to marketplace. As I said, we, last year, having good visibility into the business, having priced up, we were producing pretax margins in low double-digit [indiscernible] 10%, 11%. We decided consciously to invest 3 in some places, 400 basis points of that margin into growth, which is why membership grew 30% and revenues grew 20%. \n So we're well positioned to continue to produce our target MCR range, which is 78% to 80%. And this year, we expect to finish the year at the low end of that range. which would produce a high single-digit pretax margin. It's right where we want to be. And as somebody suggested earlier, a very now stable position, half the membership being renewal membership, 70% of it being silver, a nice platform off of which to grow measurably and modestly. \nScott Fidel: Okay. Got it. So reaffirming the initial guidance you gave us for the exchange MLR margin? \nOperator: And the next question comes from Andrew Mok with Barclays. \nAndrew Mok: I think I heard you say that you're prudent in your reserves due to change. Was there any favorable PYD in the quarter? And if so, did you reestablish that into your reserves? \nMark Keim: It's Mark. Yes, absolutely, there's favorable PYD, and you'll see that in the earnings release where we showed the prior year development on current year reserves. It tracks about as it normally does, not higher, not lower. And of course, we always replenish that. So we feel very confident I showed a 49% days claims payable, which is right in the middle of our standard range. We feel very good about our reserves even with a little bit of noise from the change situation that happened back in February. So very confident, reserves replenished, we feel adequately reserved. \nAndrew Mok: Was there any P&L impact in the quarter from the PYD? \nMark Keim: There always is. That's a normal part of a reserving cycle. Typically, the way you reserve is in the current period, you pick a number, which is generally a little bit conservative. And typically, prior periods developed favorably. That is a standard cycle of the actuarial and reserving process and how we recognize earnings. Nothing unusual there in this quarter. \nOperator: And the next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald. \nSarah James: I wanted to clarify the mix on the 2026 revenue guide. So IDA, you guys talked about it being about 1/4 organic, quarter M&A and 50% contracts contract wins. Do you still see that as the mix? And then could you give us any clarity on your rate renewal timing? What percentage of your book renews in January versus April and September. \nJoseph Zubretsky: I'll answer the second question first. We have a really nicely laddered renewal pattern in our portfolio, which is great from a risk management perspective. of our revenue renews on January 1. 21% renews in the fall. The rest of it is [indiscernible] so the renewal pattern is nicely better throughout the year. Right now, given our guidance, we know 82% of rates, we know the rates on 82% of our revenue for this year's revenue guide, which leaves us very little rate risk to our forecast. That's the -- that's how we have great visibility. And as Mark said, if you get pressure, cost pressure, in the second half of the year. In fact, at 52% of the revenue then cycles into January 1, or we capture that nicely. Your other question was? \nSarah James: Yes. On the $46 billion premium rev in 2026, do you think of it as the buckets that you laid out at I-Day, which was about 50% of the growth being from contract wins, 25% from M&A, 25% from organic? \nJoseph Zubretsky: Yes. I think that's nothing has caused us to change that outlook. I mean it's a very high-level outlook and more of it comes from M&A, that's fine. When you're buying the properties with the capital efficiency, we buy them at which we buy them. But that actual mix could change, but that's probably the way to think about it. That is the way we think about it. But again, if the mix changes, we have more contract wins and more M&A. It's all very accretive and as long as we're refilling the bucket of embedded earnings, we feel good about it. \nOperator: And this concludes the question session as well as the call itself. Thank you so much for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your phone lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Keim",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss additional details on our first quarter performance, the balance sheet, our 2024 guidance and thoughts on embedded earnings. Beginning with our first quarter results. For the quarter, we reported approximately $10 billion in total revenue and $9.5 billion of premium revenue with adjusted EPS of $5.73. Our first quarter consolidated MCR was 88.5% and reflect continued strong medical cost management. \n The change health care outage did not materially impact quarterly results, and all of our segments reported MCRs in line with our expectations. In Medicaid, our first quarter reported MCR was 89.7% as expected, the new store additions in California and Nebraska as well as Iowa and the My Choice Wisconsin acquisition in late 2023 drove a higher reported MCR in the first quarter. Recall, we have added approximately 800,000 Medicaid members in the past 3 quarters, and these new store members typically experience higher MLRs in the early stages. \n Across our Medicaid business, the major medical cost categories were largely in line with our expectations and the normal quarter-to-quarter trend of fluctuations within our guidance. In Medicare, our first quarter reported MCR was 88.7%, in line with our expectations. Higher LTSS costs and pharmacy utilization continued in our legacy business but were somewhat offset by the operational improvements and benefit adjustments that we implemented for 2024. \n Segment results now include the newly acquired Bright plans with initial performance as expected. In Marketplace, our first quarter reported MCR was 73.3%, and we are pleased with the high renewal rates and significant silver membership composition. Our adjusted G&A ratio for the quarter was 7.1%, as expected, reflecting operating discipline and the continued benefit of fixed cost leverage as we grow our business. Moving on to Medicaid redeterminations. In the quarter, we estimated a net loss of 50,000 members due to redeterminations. This was on track with our expectations and brings the total net loss from redetermination since its inception to 550,000. \n We estimate that our membership is approximately 90% of the way through the redetermination process. We expect to lose another 50,000 members in the second quarter, the last quarter of pandemic-related redeterminations to reach our total estimated net loss of 600,000. Our reconnect rate was 30%. We expect this rate to remain near 30% in the second quarter. And of course, some of the reconnect benefit will continue into the third quarter and beyond. We continue to see strong marketplace SEP membership growth as Medicaid members losing eligibility moved to Molina Marketplace products. \n Turning to our balance sheet. Our capital foundation remains strong. On January 1, we closed the Bright acquisition at a final price of approximately $425 million, funded with cash on hand. In the quarter, we harvested approximately $110 million of subsidiary dividends, bringing our parent company cash balance to $194 million at the end of the quarter. Debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged and 1.4x trailing 12-month EBITDA with our debt-to-cap ratio at about 35%. \n These ratios reflect our low leverage position and ample cash and capital capacity for additional growth and investment. In the quarter, both S&P and Moody's upgraded our credit ratings based on our low debt, stable earnings profile and high transparency. Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter was 49% and consistent with prior quarters. While the Change Healthcare outage impacted our February operations with claims 20% lower than normal, we're pleased to report that our quick response through alternative clearing houses restored claims and payments to near normal levels in March. \n Given the mid-quarter disruption, we have been appropriately prudent and are confident in the strength of our reserve position. Next, a few comments on our 2024 guidance. As Joe mentioned, we reaffirm our full year guidance with premium revenue of approximately $38 billion. Our revenue guidance remains unchanged as we work with state partners to understand the timing and impact of any contract losses in Virginia and Florida. Our full year consolidated MCR is unchanged at 88.2%. Medical cost trends are in line with expectations across all businesses, and we remain appropriately conservative in our outlook on utilization and acuity trends at this stage in the year. \n We continue to expect full year EPS of at least $23.50 per share. We see underlying strength in our core business. However, we are maintaining our full year guidance of recognizing any potential earnings headwinds in the second half of the year from potential contract losses in Virginia and Florida. Looking ahead to 2025, a few observations on our Medicare portfolio. The CMS final rate notice for Medicare Advantage has received a lot of attention. For Molina, it's important to note that only 2/3 of our Medicare segment revenue or only 10% of total enterprise revenue is fully subject to these rates. With a heavy concentration in California, we yielded a more favorable rate profile than CMS national averages. The remaining 1/3 of our Medicare segment, the MMP demonstrations received rates determined by CMS and our state partners, which continue to be appropriately commensurate with cost trends. \n We remain confident that the rate environment and our product profile will position us to grow our Medicare business profitably. The integration of our recent Bright acquisition is off to a great start. Recall that we are expecting modest dilution from Bright this year. We expect an improvement to break even in 2025 and then full run rate accretion of $1 EPS in 2026. Looking at our Medicare segment from a different perspective. \n As Joe mentioned earlier, we believe that the recent CMS 2025 final role, strategically advantaged us to grow. Currently, many dual eligible members received their medicated Medicare benefits from 2 different MCOs. CMS announced rules that will move these unaligned dual members to the D-SNP plan run by their Medicaid MCO. As such, incumbent Medicaid players will see increased growth opportunities in D-SNP. While the new rule will phase in over time, it's clear that our substantial Medicaid footprint positions us well to grow our D-SNP product to serve due eligible members. This shift, along with demand from state partners to service these complex populations gives us confidence, our Medicare portfolio will meet our long-term growth and margin targets. \n Turning to embedded earnings. We continue to guide to $4 of new store embedded earnings as we now expect approximately $0.80 from the new contract win in Texas incepting next year to be offset by our best estimate of next year's impact of the Virginia and Florida potential losses. We expect the majority of this new store embedded earnings to emerge in 2025 with the remainder in 2026. giving us further confidence in our 15% to 18% long-term growth rate for EPS. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. On Virginia and Florida, just to set the stage, we think right now, that's about a $2 billion revenue run rate and about $1.10 on EPS full year. Now the simplifying assumption is we lose both in the fourth quarter, the headwind would be $0.5 billion on revenue and $0.30. But look, we're still working that through. Those are under protest and exactly what the timing is, is somewhat unclear. But if you deposit that assumption, it would be a $0.30 component to this year's guidance. which, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, is offset by the underlying strength of the business. So if the full run rate is $1.10, we recognized $0.30 this year, what's left is $0.80 for embedded earnings. -- and that is exactly offset by the $0.80 of accretion we see in STAR and CHIP. Stephen, I'd just add to that. A year ago, our Medicaid MCR was 88.4%. This quarter, the legacy NCR was very close to that. So as Joe mentioned, coming out at 89.7% is a function of that new store MCR, which comes in hot. And recall, we said that this year, margins and earnings were a little bit back-end loaded consistent with our expectations. We came out really right where we expected. On the deal pipeline, I wouldn't say it slowed down. It's always fits and starts. What's most important to Joe and I is we constantly have a pipeline of advanced stage discussions. \n Sometimes they're banker processes, but just as often, they're one-off bespoke discussions, relationship development where we're out selling the Molina story, which is very appealing to many not-for-profits. So we've got a good pipeline of both if we could waive our wand and time them exactly where we want it, you might have seen one this quarter. But look, we are always hopeful that the pipeline is developing. We like what we see. So stay tuned on that. Yes. If you look at our marketplace, we reported 346,000 members in the first quarter. We'll go to 370,000 per our original guidance. That's unchanged. And that's on the continued strength of folks coming in from redeterminations, which is obviously an anomaly this year. Remember, Marketplace always had normal lapses through the year. So typically, marketplace volumes declined through the year. in this case, will increase through the year to our guidance of 370,000.I think you asked about the reconnect rate. We're still seeing 30% on reconnects coming back in. And both the folks coming in to marketplace as well as the reconnects, we're not seeing an anomaly on the MORs that would really change our outlook for the year. So pretty much right on track, Kevin, right where we want to be. . You mentioned the rate increase is kind of proactive, there probably more reactive, right, as so many of the states react to observe trends as opposed to proactively put it in. I wish they did. But as Joe mentioned, we're okay with the rate increases for this year. The rate increases we've seen look like they match the trend we're expecting. In we saw the acuity impact on trend really level off. And I think that's commensurate with the volume. So far, we've had 550,000 members leave only 50,000 were in this last quarter. So it's really leveled off. \n And we've seen a similar impact with the reAcquity-- redebt acuity impact here. So right now, I'd say rates look okay for the year. If they're not, the good news is 50% of our revenue comes up for new rates every January 1 which means if there's back half pressure this year, it's time really well for January 1 on the next rate cycle. Gary, the one thing I would point out is certainly when they streamline Medicaid and chip eligibility and all the procedural items that folks have to go through to maintain or get eligibility, it just makes it easier for the appropriate coverage to go to the right people, and we think that's obviously a good tailwind for our business. George, the only thing I'd add is it's really hard to compare a Molina book of business to some of our big competitors in Medicare. Remember, we skew really heavily to the dual eligibles. So we've got an awful lot of our book in the high teens to $2,000 PMPMs, which are high acuity. If you're very good at managing medical costs -- there's a big opportunity on those high-dollar members to get to the margins that Joe talked about, even in the presence of some headwinds. So I think it's really hard to make that comparison to others. It's Mark. Yes, absolutely, there's favorable PYD, and you'll see that in the earnings release where we showed the prior year development on current year reserves. It tracks about as it normally does, not higher, not lower. And of course, we always replenish that. So we feel very confident I showed a 49% days claims payable, which is right in the middle of our standard range. We feel very good about our reserves even with a little bit of noise from the change situation that happened back in February. So very confident, reserves replenished, we feel adequately reserved. There always is. That's a normal part of a reserving cycle. Typically, the way you reserve is in the current period, you pick a number, which is generally a little bit conservative. And typically, prior periods developed favorably. That is a standard cycle of the actuarial and reserving process and how we recognize earnings. Nothing unusual there in this quarter."

Today, I will cover our traditional quarterly topics, our reported financial results for the first quarter, which were in line with our expectations, highlighted by $5.73 of earnings per share. An update on our guidance, which we reaffirm at $38 billion of premium revenue and at least $23.50 in earnings per share and an update on our growth initiatives, which in the quarter were mixed, but we are maintaining our $4 per share estimate of embedded earnings and our long-term growth outlook. \n Let me start with our first quarter performance. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.73, a $9.5 billion of premium revenue, supported by excellent operating metrics across all lines of business. Our 88.5% consolidated MCR reflects continued strong medical cost management with all 3 segments reporting MCRs, in line with our expectations. We produced a 4.5% adjusted pretax margin or 3.4% after tax, a very strong result that is in the middle of our long-term target range. \n In Medicaid, we continue to deliver strong operating margins while growing our franchise as the business produced a first quarter MCR of 89.7%. Our expanded platform in California and our new Nebraska health plan, together, added over 0.5 million members and along with our new store additions in late 2023, drove an increase in the MCR above our long-term target range, but in line with our quarterly expectations. We believe we have now experienced approximately 90% of the Medicaid redetermination impact. \n The acuity shift unfolded as we predicted and appears to have stabilized in most of our markets. Rate changes, both on cycle and off-cycle largely offset the security shift with risk corridors capturing any temporary shortfall. Medicaid rates remain actuarially sound with 19 states that represent over 95% of our revenue, providing acuity-related rate adjustments within 2024. Turning to Medicare. Our first quarter reported MCR was 88.7%, our performance in line with our expectations. The higher utilization we experienced in the second half of 2023 due to higher LTSS costs and pharmacy utilization continued into 2024. But the operational improvements and supplemental benefit adjustments to be made in our legacy business have thus far proven to be successful. \n Our first quarter experience of the newly acquired Bright Medicare plans provides us with confidence in our turnaround plan to deliver the embedded earnings. Our strategy of leveraging our existing Medicaid footprint to serve high acuity, low-income Medicare beneficiaries is working well. In Marketplace, the first quarter MCR was 73.3% and in line with our expectations. \n Our membership mix comprised 50% renewal members and 70% of members in our silver product. Strong renewals gives us keen insight into the acuity of our membership base. We continue to expect this business to grow throughout the year as the Medicaid redetermination process provides a great opportunity to capture membership during the special enrollment period. Turning now to our guidance for the full year. Based on our consolidated first quarter results, we reaffirm our full year 2024 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $23.50 or 13% year-over-year growth. Our full year premium revenue remains unchanged at approximately $38 billion or 17% year-over-year growth. \n While we are seeing increased underlying strength in our core business, we are maintaining our full year guidance to account for any potential earnings headwind in the second half of the year from potential contract losses in Virginia and Florida. Our 2024 revenue and EPS guidance provides a strong foundation for profitable growth in 2025 and beyond. Now some comments on our growth initiatives. In Medicaid, we had mixed success in the quarter. We were awarded a large RFP win in Texas and a large reprocurement win in Michigan, but we're not awarded contracts in 2 other existing states, Virginia and Florida. All these impacts combined caused no net change to our embedded earnings, which remains at $4 per share. \n Let me provide some commentary on these RFP outcomes. In Texas, the state announced its intent to award us all 7 of our preferred service areas as part of the STAR and CHIP programs. This contract is expected to begin in September 2025 and last for 6 years with the option to extend up to an additional 6 years. The award expands our footprint and increases our market share. We successfully defended our position in Michigan and were awarded a contract in 6 regions. While these regions represent 93% of our current membership, the award reduced the number of payers in many of our retained regions and thus, we expect to grow our market share. \n We were very disappointed with the outcome in the Virginia RFP, but we are exercising our right to challenge this decision. We were also disappointed with the RFP result in Florida, but history has shown that the ultimate outcome there could be more favorable. We will continue to refine our membership, revenue and embedded earnings estimates as we gain clarity on the new contracts, our expanding market share and the unwinding of any lost revenue. Now with respect to future growth initiatives, our growth pipeline remains replete with opportunity. \n Regarding RFPs, many opportunities remain with over $60 billion of premium opportunity up for bid over the next 3 years. This includes in-flight RFP bids in 2 states, Kansas and Georgia, and a projected near-term RFP in North Carolina. The Texas STAR Kids program is likely going to RFP soon, where we now have a very strong statewide presence and great momentum. We remain confident in our ability to win new state contracts and deliver clinical and financial outcomes that align with the needs of our state partners. Although this quarter's RFP results were mixed, since we began our growth strategy, we are 7 for 9 in reprocurements and 8 for 10 in new business procurements. This track record gives us great confidence in our strategy and our continued ability to drive growth. \n With respect to M&A initiatives, our acquisition pipeline contains many actionable opportunities. We have executed 8 transactions totaling $11 billion in revenue over the past 4 years, and M&A will continue to be a key component of our strategy. Next, as we look forward into 2025, 2 comments about the outlook for our Medicare portfolio. First, our Medicare product profile has different characteristics than mainstream MAPD business. Our business is a combination of legacy D-SNP, MNP demonstrations and our newly acquired Bright business. With this lineup of products, factors such as rate setting, bidding and revenue drivers do matter, but to a lesser extent. \n Second, the product portfolio is well positioned to contribute to our growth. Our penetration in dual eligible populations, high acuity and dual income will benefit from further integration of Medicare and Medicaid benefits. BMS recently announced rules to closely align dual-eligible populations with Medicaid MCOs, which means our Medicaid footprint will be a growth catalyst for attracting and retaining dual-eligible membership. \n With our 2024 guidance reaffirmed, we remain committed to delivering on our long-term premium and earnings per share growth earnings. With all of the successful growth activity in M&A in new and expanded contracts, even considering the potential for contract losses or reductions, we maintain our embedded earnings outlook at $4 per share. Mark will provide insight on the components in a moment, but the majority is still expected to emerge in 2025. \n In summary, we are very pleased with our first quarter 2024 financial and operating performance. That performance, combined with our successful track record for producing top line revenue keeps us on track for sustaining profitable growth consistent with our long-term targets. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for some additional color on the financials. Mark? Okay. We are clearly saying that if we have a revenue loss in the third and fourth quarters due to the contract losses and the related earnings, the strength of the core business will produce enough earnings power to offset that. And it's no one thing. It's just general performance of all our portfolios. The loss ratios in our Medicaid and Medicare business get better as the year progresses for a variety of reasons.\n Obviously, in marketplace, it's higher in the back half due to the normal seasonality of that business. But there is 90 basis points of improvement projected in the Medicaid of MCRs in the last 3 quarters of the year and 90 basis points of improvement in the Medicare MCRs in the second, third and fourth quarters. So it's just general performance of the business. The seasonality happens for a variety of reasons, general strength of the business to offset any potential earnings drag from potentially lost contracts. It doesn't really change our M&A strategy. I mean we look for opportunities across all of [indiscernible], most of our M&A activity has been in Medicaid, but the Bright acquisition represents first M&A opportunity that we actioned in Medicare. But what we're really saying is the fact that we have this 20-state footprint in Medicaid and growing. The decent opportunity is just one more way to monetize your significant Medicaid footprint. And the fact that we have a very robust and very operationally excellent decent business. Those 2 platforms combined will allow us to participate in the duly eligible population growth rate that's going to happen here over the next number of years. So we're very, very pleased with the final rule that came out from CMS, which basically says that Medicaid will be the anchor tenant for action in the dual eligible population. I'll kick it to Mark for the question on the Florida and Virginia earnings. Go ahead. Josh,and your second question related to Bright now that we've owned the business for a full quarter, we are very optimistic and confident in the $1 of ultimate accretion. The way to think about that business is actually very simple. Operationally breakeven in year 1 with a slight earnings drag related to the carrying costs, breakeven in your -- operationally breakeven in year 2. And full $1 accretion in year 3 and we get there by -- we inherited a 95% MCR in the business. We've managed it to 87%. We inherited a 13% G&A ratio in the business. We managed to 8%, that's 1,300 basis points of turnaround, which on $1.6 billion of revenue would show you how we get to the full accretion. \n The G&A savings will likely happen sooner as we need to go through 2 pricing cycles to get the MCR down to 87%. But now that we've owned it for a quarter and have excellent line of sight to the operating metrics and the dynamics of the business we're very confident in producing that portion of our embedded earnings. Stephen, I'll answer the first question first and then kick it to Mark on the Medicaid MCR. The Medicaid MCR of 89.7% in the quarter was as expected and heavily influenced by 20% of the member month volume in the quarter was on new business, either new business that came in from California and Nebraska on [ 11 ] or our -- second half of our Iowa contract from 2023 in the My Choice acquisition. That new business runs in the '90s. So you can do the math. That created pressure on the Medicaid MCR in the first quarter. \n As we work through the Molina playbook, operational improvements across all the dimensions of managed care, that performance improves, second, third and fourth quarter, which really creates a very different tilt to the way the earnings pattern is emerging this year versus prior years. It starts out high and improved throughout the year. As I said, the MCRs in the last few quarters are 90 basis points better than the first and we're still on target to hit 89% in our full year guidance on Medicaid, which is at the top end of our long-term target range. Mark? I'll start off and then I'll kick it to Mark, but just to recap the entire redetermination process from start to finish. We estimate that at the high of the PHE, we have grown 1 million members due to the pause in the redetermination process. We are now projecting to lose 600,000 of those, 550,000 lost to date, another 50,000 in the second quarter. we have been experiencing a 30% reconnect rate. And once the redetermination process stops, that reconnect rate will continue on into the late spring and perhaps even into the summer. \n We are seeing a significant increase in our special enrollment in marketplace. Now whether you're coming in from Medicaid or not is a self-reporting feature. So we don't have exact statistics on how many are coming from other companies' Medicaid roles. But we've been averaging 12,000 to 15,000 SEP members in prior quarters, and that's double. It's up to 30,000 hour, which is obviously being heavily influenced by members coming off of Medicaid into marketplace. Mark, anything to add? Let me recap where we are in the rate environment, and then I'll kick it to Mark for some more color. We couldn't be more pleased with the way our state customers have responded to having rates be commensurate with normal cost trends and trends that have been influenced by the acuity shift. We received acuity-related adjustments in 19 states, representing 95% of our revenue. We had 5 retroactive rate adjustments, and we're actually anticipating perhaps 4 more. So the states have been very responsive and rates have been actual really sound. \n Look, we're guiding to the top end of our MCR rate for the entire year at 89%, and that's with 2 very unprecedented phenomenon going on in the book of business. One is the unprecedented shift in the national [indiscernible] due to the redetermination process, and the other is bringing on 800,000 new members that committed higher MCRs. With those 2 found on influencing how medical costs emerge, producing an MCR at the high end of our long-term range is something we're very, very pleased with. \n The answer is no. We expect rates next year to be actually sound, we expect them to be commensurate with the medical cost trends we're experiencing, fee schedule increases, benefits carved in and out, that's the normal process, and we have every reason to believe that rates will be actually sound going into next year. Mark, anything to add? Sure. A.J., the small silver and stable strategy was a short-term reaction to having to re-position the business to maintain a profile of single digit -- mid-single digit pretax margins. That was a temporal way to look at the business. we invested about 300 basis points of what call excess margin from last year into the business this year, and that's why we're growing membership at 30% and premium revenues are growing at 20%. So we like the nice steady progression of the business. We do expect to grow it. But being in the insurance business as long as I have, you never try to grow any portfolio organically that quickly because when underwriting isn't allowed, which -- that's what this product is, you have to be very wary of where you're bidding against the market, who else is in the market and where your results are coming out for the prior year. So we're going to be cautious. But the nice steady growth we saw this year feels really good to us. We're able to maintain a profile of high single-digit pretax margins and grow at this rate I think that's what to expect. Yes. Justin, the -- last quarter, we gave you the building blocks for an outlook into 2025, and we have not changed our view of those building blocks. Obviously, embedded earnings still at $4, we have actually changed the composition of that and how those emerge in upcoming years has changed slightly. But the building blocks haven't changed. We continue to harvest earnings out of our existing footprint. We talked about operating leverage, talk about embedded earnings. Obviously, there likely will be a natural headwind from interest rate declines into next year. So the building blocks haven't changed, and that's still our forward look for 2025, again, not guidance, but an outlook. On Texas, we don't know. We used very conservative estimates of what our market share would likely to be in the 7 regions that we won and use kind of the average portfolio margins. I don't think there's anything more to read into it than that. We think it's a conservative and reasonable estimate of what that business will produce. I don't -- it's far too early, and we don't want to get ahead of our customer on that. So we'll wait and see until we have more visibility into how membership will be allocated. I think that's the prudent thing to do here. In, on Florida, we're not making a prediction on how the process will unfold. We're citing historical precedent. Historical precedent would suggest that this is not the end, it's sort of the beginning of the end of the process. that there's more discussions that will take place. So I don't want to, again, get ahead of the state on this. But if you look at the past 2 procurements in Florida, there have been extended conversations and there are regions in Florida that still do not have maximum awards given. So again, just citing historical precedent. On the $46 billion of revenue, but we have a $60 billion new contract pipeline. Kansas and Georgia are sitting out there currently live and in process. as I mentioned, Texas STAR Kids. We have great momentum in the State of Texas. \n North Carolina, we didn't be down North Carolina last time because it was too early in our turnaround plan to bid on anything. So we're looking at the $60 billion pipeline and feeling pretty good about our prospects there. Look, we're for 7 for 9 reprocurements and we started our growth journey. We're 8 for 10 and new business wins. We have 8 M&A transactions totaling $1 billion of revenue over the past 4 years. We're feeling really good about the long-term revenue target here and our ability to produce continued 13% to 15% revenue growth and 15% to 18% earnings per share growth. Nothing's changed. And our trajectory here, even though we're disappointed with the 2 RFP situations in the second quarter -- in the first quarter. On the -- I believe your first question was on the enhanced subsidies for Marketplace. I understand it -- it's hard to say. -- bear in mind, they do go away unless legislation is passed to extend them. That's -- sometimes that's misunderstood. They are going away because the subsidy enhancement was temporary. and a less legislation is passed to extend them they will. \n Now I can go through all types of political scenarios and legislative scenarios. There's lots of people who think that, that can easily be given up for an extension of the Trump tax cuts. I'm not going to make any political conclusions here, but it's probably a 50-50 push on how that gets done and if it gets done. We did not grow significantly when those enhanced subsidies came in because our members, keep in mind, we leverage our Medicaid footprint. We go after highly subsidized, low-income members and we didn't benefit a lot by the enhanced subsidies as most of our membership was already very, very highly subsidized. So from our perspective, we're not looking at it as a huge issue for us in terms of membership loss. And that's the way I would answer the first part of your question. The second part had to do with which ruling. I want to make sure I understood your question. Not significant. We're still analyzing it. We're obviously aware of it. We're analyzing it. lots of different features to it, many of which incept over very extended periods of time. So there's nothing to immediately react to. But nothing in that guideline changes of the long-term trajectory of the business. As I've said many times, I often asked, is there any political legislative or judicial environmental issue that causes you major concern on the viability of the businesses you're in. And the answer is no. The way the election comes out, whether Congress is split, whether things can get done vis-a-vis the 60 votes in the Senate needed to do something fundamental, the reconciliation process, et cetera. We don't -- we think the legislative and political scenarios are pretty neutral for the sustainability of the businesses we're in. Yes. Well, our target for our Medicare business is mid-single-digit pretax. I wasn't sure whether you're referring to pretax or after tax, our NCR range for the products we're in is 87% to 88%. As we said, we hope to get -- not hope. We're projecting to get right down to 87% here over the next couple of years. So we still target mid-single-digit pretax margins in this business. \n We like the D-SNP business not only can produce excellent profits, but monetizing our Medicaid footprint for dual eligible population here over time is going to be a significant growth category for us. So we're perfectly positioned, but at least we're well, well positioned to take advantage of the growth in the deorgible population here, and we still target mid-single-digit pretax margins, MCRs in the 87% to 88% range. On these protest processes, I think I've said about all I really should say about them. They are legal processes, and we have to see how they unfold. But of course, through various requests, I'm sure everybody's got the information they need to document their findings and to put their case forward. So that's all I'll say about it. \n Your last question was about market to marketplace. As I said, we, last year, having good visibility into the business, having priced up, we were producing pretax margins in low double-digit [indiscernible] 10%, 11%. We decided consciously to invest 3 in some places, 400 basis points of that margin into growth, which is why membership grew 30% and revenues grew 20%. \n So we're well positioned to continue to produce our target MCR range, which is 78% to 80%. And this year, we expect to finish the year at the low end of that range. which would produce a high single-digit pretax margin. It's right where we want to be. And as somebody suggested earlier, a very now stable position, half the membership being renewal membership, 70% of it being silver, a nice platform off of which to grow measurably and modestly. I'll answer the second question first. We have a really nicely laddered renewal pattern in our portfolio, which is great from a risk management perspective. of our revenue renews on January 1. 21% renews in the fall. The rest of it is [indiscernible] so the renewal pattern is nicely better throughout the year. Right now, given our guidance, we know 82% of rates, we know the rates on 82% of our revenue for this year's revenue guide, which leaves us very little rate risk to our forecast. That's the -- that's how we have great visibility. And as Mark said, if you get pressure, cost pressure, in the second half of the year. In fact, at 52% of the revenue then cycles into January 1, or we capture that nicely. Your other question was? Yes. I think that's nothing has caused us to change that outlook. I mean it's a very high-level outlook and more of it comes from M&A, that's fine. When you're buying the properties with the capital efficiency, we buy them at which we buy them. But that actual mix could change, but that's probably the way to think about it. That is the way we think about it. But again, if the mix changes, we have more contract wins and more M&A. It's all very accretive and as long as we're refilling the bucket of embedded earnings, we feel good about it."
