At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Rick Lund, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.\nRick Lund: Good afternoon, and welcome to Veeva\u2019s Fiscal 2020 fourth quarter and full year earnings call for the quarter and year ended January 31, 2020. With me on today\u2019s call are Peter Gassner, our Chief Executive Officer; Paul Shawah, SVP of Commercial Cloud; and Tim Cabral, our Chief Financial Officer. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding trends, our strategies and the anticipated performance of the business. These forward-looking statements will be based on management\u2019s current views and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the risks listed in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our most recent filing on Form 10-Q, which is available on the Company\u2019s website at veeva.com under the Investors section and on the SEC\u2019s website at sec.gov. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today, March 3, 2020. If this call is replayed or viewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Veeva disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today\u2019s call but will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. On the call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today\u2019s earnings release, which is available on our website and as an exhibit to the Form 8-K filed with the SEC just before this call. As you may have also seen in our earnings release, we intend to begin using our website as a channel of public disclosure consistent with Regulation FD. Going forward, please monitor our Investor Relations website in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings and public conference calls and webcasts. Finally, I\u2019d like to remind everybody that we closed two acquisitions in the fourth quarter. On this call, we will provide details around how these acquisitions impacted our Q4 and fiscal 2020 results and how they contribute to our fiscal 2021 guidance for total revenue and Commercial Cloud subscription revenue. In addition, we will in some cases provide growth rates comparing periods that include the contribution from these acquisitions to periods that do not. With that, thank you for joining us and I will turn it over to Peter.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you, Rick, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Q4 was another strong quarter with results ahead of our guidance. Fourth quarter revenue was $312 million, up 34% year-over-year, subscription revenue grew 33% and our non-GAAP operating margin was 34%. Past year was an exceptional one for Veeva. We retained our deep focus on customer success and product excellence. We expanded our leadership position and passed $1 billion in revenue a year and a half ahead of plan. We accelerated our pace of innovation in established and new markets and we made a potentially transformative acquisition with the addition of Crossix. We\u2019ve refined our operating model for driving innovation in existing markets while also creating new agile startups within Veeva. This gives our startups like CDMS and safety, the autonomy to be laser focused on new markets, while our core teams remain dedicated to transformation in their areas like in CRM for example, where we are embedding AI in ways that will fundamentally advance the industry. Also key has been the growth of our leadership team, which has expanded thanks to the exceptional new people we brought on board this year and the very talented people that have developed within Veeva. In all, we have set ourselves up well from a product, operating model and team perspective to execute on the major opportunities ahead and to achieve our $3 billion revenue target in 2025. Thank you, and congratulations to the entire Veeva team for their outstanding work this year. Now I\u2019d like to share some highlights for the quarter and year. It was a record quarter and year for Veeva Commercial Cloud. We further extended our leadership in core CRM. Our bookings increased over last year and we also saw an increased pace of new customer wins adding 53 new customers compared to 46 the year prior. Our strength in core CRM is fueling growth in Commercial Cloud overall as companies look to Veeva as their commercial foundation for the future. For example, in the quarter, a cutting edge specialty diagnostics customer who was anticipating hyper growth expanded their use of Veeva CRM and adopted five additional Commercial Cloud applications enterprise wide. This seven figure deal with our largest ever in commercial SMB and shows the strategic importance of our solution for companies of all sizes. Veeva OpenData also had a number of wins in the quarter as we continue to gain momentum in the data market. One of our key wins was a top 20 pharma selected OpenData in the U.S. replacing their current solution, head-to-head they found our data was better and more expensive. This is key as they move to new selling models that required greater depth of information, agility and the vendor that operates as a true partner committed to their success. Also in the commercial area, I\u2019m pleased to share that Crossix close the year strong with revenue coming in right on plans. The acquisition is going exceptionally well. The Crossix team has brought new DNA around patients and data into Veeva. Coming together we\u2019ll go well beyond what either company could have accomplished independently. We have an exceptionally strong joint vision and roadmap, which you\u2019ll hear more about this year. Before moving to Vault, I\u2019d like to extend a special thanks to the Veeva CRM team for their rapid response to help our customers navigate the challenges surrounding the coronavirus. For Veeva CRM customers not currently using engage meeting, we are providing free access through September for field users in impacted areas. This allows reps to connect online with the doctors that depend on them for information about the latest research and treatment for their patients. In Veeva Vault, we had a best quarter ever capping off a great year that was driven by strength across product areas and geographies. We are winning more new Vault customers and existing customers are expanding their use. We closed the year with 715 Vault customers up 25% from a year ago and existing customers continue to buy more based upon their success with Vault and because of the benefits of having all applications on a single modern cloud platform. Our average Vault customer now has two to three Vault applications. The Vault platform has proven to be a unique and powerful asset allowing us to rapidly develop and scale applications across a range of areas. We now have 18 Vault applications in all. Regulatory is a good examples of momentum we were seeing across the Board. In the quarter at top 20 pharma and a top 50 pharma selected Veeva Vault RIM as their enterprise standard. These customers were struggling with a patchwork of legacy and custom built solutions. One will replace more than 80 systems with Vault RIM. Over the past two years, the size of the RIM subscription business has doubled. We now have more than 200 RIM customers and great potential as we look ahead. Clinical is another area of significant strength and opportunity for us. In Q4, we signed our 14th top 20 pharma for eTMF. Our established track record of customer success with Vault eTMF is providing opportunities for additional Veeva clinical applications as customer see the benefit of a unified solution on a world-class cloud platform. For instance, in Q4, an existing top 20 eTMF customers standardized on Vault Study Startup, they are the seventh top 20 pharma to standardize on Study Startup. It\u2019s been less than four years since we started expanding our clinical suite beyond eTMF and already a quarter of our eTMF customers have at least one other clinical application. I\u2019m very excited about the growth we\u2019re seeing in clinical and the significant runway ahead. I\u2019m also pleased with our progress in newer Vault products. Safety and CDMS are two of the biggest opportunities that we have on the R&D side and both are showing good early momentum. We have more than a dozen early adopters for safety and more than 60 studies have started on CDMS. These two areas are still small in terms of revenue, but we feel very good about the potential for these products to be market leading over time. This year will be an important one as we build our track record of customer success and continue to innovate in both areas. Outside life sciences for CPG, chemicals and cosmetics, we had a number of expansions and added some big wins with new companies, including a top 10 CPG company who will adopt QualityOne, and a top 10 cosmetics company to standardizing on RegulatoryOne. In reflecting on the year for this business and looking ahead, we set the right course in the Veeva Way. We kept our focus on customer success and doing the right things for our early adopters, which is helping establish Veeva as a trusted provider in these new industries. It was a great informative year for Veeva. We grew and evolved an important new ways. We have a big opportunity ahead and the right team, operating model, technology and focus on execution to fuel our growth well into the future. With that, I\u2019d like to hand it over to Tim.\nTim Cabral: Thanks, Peter. Q4 was a strong finish to another outstanding year. As a reminder, this is our first quarter with Crossix and Physicians World. And we are providing an additional level of transparency during this call to assist in your understanding of how these acquisitions impacted our results and will contribute to our fiscal 2021 guidance. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $312 million, up 34% from $232 million a year ago. Crossix and Physicians World contributed more than $19 million of total revenue in the quarter. Vault was 49% of total revenue versus 52% in Q3. For the year, total revenue was $1,104 million up from $862 million in fiscal 2019. Excluding Crossix and Physicians World, total revenue grew 26% year-over-year. For the full year, Vault represented 51% of total revenue as compared to 47% in fiscal 2019. Subscription revenue in the quarter totaled $254 million up 33% from $191 million in the prior year. Crossix contributed roughly $14 million of subscription revenue in Q4, which includes the impact of a purchase accounting write down of nearly $3 million. This contribution from Crossix represented an incremental seven points of growth in the period. Vault was 47% of subscription revenue versus 49% in Q3. For the full year, subscription revenue came in at $896 million up from $694 million in fiscal 2019. Commercial Cloud subscription revenue grew 15%, excluding the impact from Crossix and Vault subscription revenue grew 43%. In fiscal 2020, our revenue retention rate was 121%. This metric is defined in the earnings release and reflects annualized subscription revenue growth within existing customers. Net of revenue attrition and continues to illustrate the increasing value we are providing to our customers and the life sciences industry. Services revenue came in at $57 million, up 38% from $42 million last year. Excluding Crossix and Physicians World, service revenue grew 25% year-over-year. For the full year, service revenue totaled $208 million, up from $168 million in fiscal 2019. Non-GAAP operating income was $103 million, which came in above the high end of our guidance. This result was driven by revenue outperformance offset in part by a couple of million dollars of additional one-time commission expenses for both our core business and the acquired Crossix business. We added 489 net headcount this quarter, including the 384 Crossix and Physicians World employees joining Veeva. Fiscal 2020 ended with a total of 3,501 employees up from 2,553 a year ago. Moving to the balance sheet, deferred revenue is $469 million compared to $251 million at the end of the third quarter. Calculated billings for the fourth quarter came in at about $528 million, which includes roughly $9 million of net acquired deferred revenue, less the acquired unbilled receivables. After adjusting for this, calculated billings in the quarter was $519 million ahead of the high end of our guidance. Crossix and Physicians World contributed $35 million to calculated billings in the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect calculated billings of approximately $330 million for Q1 and $1,500 million for fiscal 2021 with 40% to 41% of those billings coming in Q4. Please remember that there are numerous factors that make year-over-year comparisons of this metric highly variable on a quarterly basis. Therefore, we do not believe it is a good indicator of the underlying momentum of our business and we do not manage to it internally. Our subscription revenue guidance and calculated billings guidance for the full fiscal year are the best indicators of our momentum. Elsewhere on the balance sheet, we exited Q4 with $1,087 million in cash and short-term investments down $408 million from the end of Q3. This reduction was mainly driven by the Crossix and Physicians World acquisitions. In Q4, operating cash flow was $39 million, which includes $11 million in excess tax benefit. For the year, operating cash flow came in at $437 million, including a total of roughly $50 million in excess tax benefit. Excluding the tax benefit, operating cash flow for the year was $387 million above our full year guidance. We had another strong collections quarter in Q4, including nearly $15 million we had planned to collect in Q1 of fiscal 2021. For fiscal 2021, we expect operating cash flow to be at least $460 million, excluding the excess tax benefit. Next, I\u2019d like to share our outlook for Q1 and for the full year of fiscal 2021. For the first quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $327 million and $328 million with services revenue contributing roughly $63 million. We anticipate non-GAAP operating income of $117 million to $118 million and non-GAAP net income per share of $0.59 to $0.60 based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 159 million shares. Please note, we will maintain our non-GAAP tax rate at 21% for fiscal 2021. As a reminder, this rate is not something that we adjust quarterly and we\u2019ll evaluate it again next year. For the year, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $1,400 million to $1,405 million, which is an increase from the initial outlook provided on our Q3 earnings call. Within that number, we expect the contribution from Crossix and Physicians World to be between $105 million and $110 million in fiscal 2021. We expect subscription revenue to be roughly $1,145 million for the full year. Commercial cloud subscription revenue is expected to be roughly $585 million. Included in that number, we expect Crossix to contribute between $85 million and $87 million of subscription revenue for the year. This number includes the impact of roughly $2.4 million of purchase accounting write down, which we will see mostly impacting our Q1 results. Vault subscription revenue is expected to be roughly $560 million representing an increase of approximately 31% year-over-year. Before moving on, I\u2019d like to provide some additional context for the Vault subscription growth outlook. As we near the end of the Zinc MAPS migration to PromoMats, Commercial Vault to successfully become the market leader and with our strong market share, we expect Commercial Vault growth to slow. Additionally, as we have disclosed throughout the year, fiscal 2020s subscription revenue benefited from both favorable booking linearity and a tailwind resulting from the recognition of unbilled revenue from multi-year contracts with ramping fees. Moving on, we expect non-GAAP operating income of roughly $500 million for the full year, a non-GAAP operating margin of almost 36%. Finally, we expect non-GAAP net income per share of about $2.50 for the year, based on a fully diluted share count of approximately $160 million. In summary, the team has done an excellent job delivering another record year. Given our focus on innovation and execution, we continue to be confident in our ability to deliver $3 billion in revenue in calendar 2025. Thanks for joining the call today. And I\u2019ll now turn it over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ken Wong from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nKen Wong: Great quarter guys and thanks for taking my question. The first thing I want to touch on, I\u2019m sure everyone is following it in the headlines, but obviously the impact of coronavirus and any headwinds you might be seeing in China. I guess, first just \u2013 again, what are you guys maybe directly seeing or projecting. And then second, as it relates to your customer base, how should we think about the impact to their business? Obviously, there\u2019s probably maybe some tailwinds as well there and how that might flow through for you guys.\nPeter Gassner: All right. This is Peter. I\u2019ll take that one. First, our hearts go out to the people, the families that are seriously affected by this and we hope they have a speedy recovery. As it goes to our customers, they\u2019re really working hard to try to develop things that will help the situation, vaccines or cures actually for this. And we\u2019re helping our customers, where we can, but we know they\u2019re working around the clock. In terms of our business, we haven\u2019t seen project slowdowns yet or haven\u2019t seen any projects canceled. We\u2019ve seen a little bit of slowdown as customers adjust to working remotely in some regions, nothing that would be material to our financials. In terms of Veeva, we\u2019re in countries that are heavily impacted where we have offices, we\u2019ve instituted a work from home policy. Now for Veeva that\u2019s very normal. We handle video conferencing very well. We grew up as a very virtual company. So I believe we\u2019re well positioned to handle this. One of the things that we\u2019re doing, I mentioned on our script is helping the industry by providing free Veeva CRM Engage meeting licenses to our customers up until September. That way they can continue their interactions with the doctors that they need to and they can do that remotely. So in summary, our customers are working hard to provide the medicines here. There\u2019s no material impact to our business at this time.\nKen Wong: Great. And then maybe a quick follow-up. Just on the competitive landscape, whether it was product or customer engagement, there\u2019s a perception that maybe a door was left open, a crack that allowed competitors to maybe sneak a foot in. Any efforts, maybe button up customer outreach, retention efforts to make sure things like that don\u2019t happen down the line.\nPaul Shawah: Yes. Hey, Ken, this is Paul. I\u2019ll take that one. So let me come in at a high level on the competitive \u2013 the overall competitive landscape and then more specifically on what we\u2019re doing. The competitive landscape is pretty much similar to what it\u2019s been over the last year. Things haven\u2019t really changed all that much. IQVIA is our primary competitor, as you know, there\u2019s certainly regional competitors that we have, but they\u2019re the ones that are primary in terms of global kind of scope there. IQVIA has continued to be aggressive in terms of how they approach the market in of pricing and bundling. Some of their projects have been a bit more services oriented, instead of standard product. And I think over the short-term that sort of thing could work out. I think over the long-term custom projects are not great. From Veeva\u2019s perspective, we had really great success last year. I\u2019m really proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished. Peter highlighted that we had 63 net new CRM customers compared with the year before, where it was 46. So we\u2019ve grown and we\u2019ve actually expanded our share last year. And of those wins, most of them came \u2013 most of them were head to head with IQVIA, and many of them were IQVIA replacements. So I\u2019m really proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished. That\u2019s the results. The results, I think, speak for themselves in terms of what we\u2019re doing, where \u2013 we think our strategy is the right one, which is focus on product innovation and focus on customer success. So we\u2019re innovating within core CRM in many different ways. And Peter highlighted some of the AI that we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re also expanding our \u2013 the add-ons and we\u2019re innovating a new add-on areas and we\u2019ll continue to add new products and then we\u2019re relentlessly focused on the customer success side. So that\u2019s our strategy to make sure those sorts of things don\u2019t happen. I expect at specific accounts there could be factors that lead to a specific decision. But we\u2019re doing our best and we\u2019re going to continue to focus on innovation and customer success.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you. I\u2019ve got two maybe, both for Tim. So Tim, on the Vault subscription revenue growth, I think you closed out fiscal 2020 with 43% growth, a fantastic result. It looks like your guidance is for a decel to 31%. So just given that this is your \u2013 obviously, your growth engine, do you mind elaborating on the reasons for that Vault slow down? It sounds like it might be a little bit more on the commercial sides. Maybe the clinical trial side is stronger and there\u2019s a mix shift going on. But maybe just to start there just to describe what\u2019s happening. Thanks.\nTim Cabral: Sure, Karl. Certainly, happy with the momentum of the Vault business and happy with the guidance. To your point in terms of comparing the fiscal 2020 results, and you\u2019re correct, 43% was the VAULT growth number there versus a 21 guide. A couple things to keep in mind\u2026\nPaul Shawah: 31%.\nTim Cabral: 31%, sorry. I said fiscal 2021 and 21% \u2013 31% guide. A couple of things to keep in mind and you\u2019re right, Vault Commercial, as we\u2019re nearing the end of the Zinc MAPS migration of PromoMats, we\u2019ve really become the market leader involved commercial. And if this market share, we expect that Commercial Vault\u2019s business to slow a bit. But there was also a couple of favorable dynamics in fiscal 2020 that we don\u2019t expect to repeat this year. One is the favorable linearity of bookings and we talked about that through the year fiscal 2020. And the second was the tailwinds we saw from the recognition of multi-year ELAs. Again, we don\u2019t expect both those dynamics to necessarily happen on a consistent basis and we don\u2019t have that in our assumption of the fiscal 2021 guidance. But lastly, I would say, this is consistent with the way that we viewed the Vault, the Vault business. And this view definitely informed our early fiscal 2021 guide that we gave 90 days ago, as well as our $3 billion revenue target in 25.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it, okay. That\u2019s helpful, Tim. And then maybe my follow-up is just on the revenue performance in fourth quarter just closed, $312 million relative to your guide of $299 million. That\u2019s a 4% beat and that\u2019s quite a bit higher than I\u2019m used to seeing with Veeva. So I\u2019m just wondering if you could elaborate on that. It doesn\u2019t sound like the upside came from acquisitions. Pete did mention that it was roughly in line. So was there some factor that might\u2019ve driven sort of more in period revenue upside than you anticipated three months ago? Thanks a lot.\nTim Cabral: Sure. I think it was in part acquisitions. When we gave the guidance last quarter, 90 days ago, we had talked about the contribution from acquisitions being roughly $15 million and that came in a bit higher. Most of that was due to a smaller purchase accounting right off that we had anticipated as well as good performance from those businesses. I would say the other part of the beat, Karl was a more normal, stronger execution and stronger bookings in the quarter. And we also saw a little bit more services revenue than we had anticipated 90 days ago. And as we\u2019ve talked in the past, it\u2019s sort of the lumpy part of our business. So those \u2013 that part of the business can move up and down even within a 90 day period.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it, okay. Very helpful on both answers. Thank you, Tim.\nTim Cabral: Thanks, Karl.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Saket Kalia from Barclays. Your line is open.\nSaket Kalia: Hey, Peter. Hey, Tim. Thanks for taking my questions here. Peter, maybe just to start with you, I think we said that there were about 140 new Vault customers this year that started with one Vault solution. Looking back at sort of the history of that product, can you just talk about how the profile of that initial land has maybe changed with those 140 net new customers versus what you would typically land with them in the past?\nPeter Gassner: That\u2019s a good question. In terms of the profile of where people start for Development Cloud. I really haven\u2019t seen that quite changed much. They would generally start in one area where they have the most need. It will be in the regulatory area, a quality area or a clinical area. I\u2019d say if there\u2019s any \u2013 if you look at a shift from maybe four years ago, I think we see a little bit more people starting in the quality area now than we used to, because our quality suite has gotten much broader. We have our QMS product, our QualityDocs products, which was our original one and our training product. So that\u2019s maybe a little bit higher, but it hasn\u2019t materially changed. They will start in the area where they have the most need. The smallest companies will generally start in either the quality area or the clinical area, because those would be the first needs of the smallest companies.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. Got it. And then for my follow-up for maybe you, Tim, maybe on CDMS, can you just remind us how that\u2019s priced, as you grow the number of trials here and the size of those trials. Does that directly impact revenue or billings or are those typically part of kind of broader ELA type of agreements?\nPeter Gassner: This is Peter. I could jump in on that one. There\u2019s no particular pattern that would be applicable to all customers. In general, we\u2019re going to start small with a new customer. They\u2019re going to try us out in certain areas, a small trial-by-trial small revenue. It can graduate to an ELA over time, and that takes some time to work through. So there\u2019s no particular pattern there. I would say it\u2019s actually quite similar also to what we saw in the early days of clinical with Veeva five years ago.\nSaket Kalia: Very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stan Zlotsky from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nStan Zlotsky: Perfect. Thank you so much and I apologize for any background noise during this call. A couple of questions from my end. Peter, you mentioned a top 20 pharma win with your clearly data product. Could you give us a little bit more detail on that win? And maybe just at a higher level, could you get us some updates on how your overall data efforts are going? And then I have a quick follow-up for Tim.\nPeter Gassner: This was a pretty standard. It was a top 20 pharma in the U.S. diversified pharma. They\u2019re in oncology, many different areas \u2013 therapeutic areas. So their needs for data are quite diverse because they have to navigate a lot of complex health systems. The health system might be the Mayo Clinic, they or MD Anderson and all the doctors that are related to there. So they need a robust set of data. They had a set of data provided from a legacy provider and the service just wasn\u2019t quite what they wanted and the quality and quantity and expansiveness of the data wasn\u2019t quite what they wanted. So we were able to show them a better solution and they\u2019re migrating towards it. And that\u2019s a project that\u2019s long, but not that long, it\u2019s less than a year project. So it\u2019s a pretty down the middle \u2013 have been replaced. In terms of our data offerings, our OpenData that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a market where it\u2019s country by country. So we\u2019re the market leader in China. We\u2019re doing a bit quite well in the U.S. here and in Europe. It\u2019s earlier for us and we are making progress country by country. So I\u2019d say steady, steady as she goes on OpenData.\nStan Zlotsky: Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then for Tim, going back to Vault, 31% revenue guidance for fiscal 2021. Could you perhaps remind us, how much of a benefit did you see in fiscal 2020 from those ramping contracts on the both side, especially, both Clinical Vault R&D. And when you look at fiscal 2021, do you expect those benefits to simply not be there or do you expect those benefits to perhaps turn into headwinds as a result of the ramping contract nature of them? Thank you.\nTim Cabral: Sure. So in terms of the fiscal 2021 results, it was about a 300 point tailwind for those particular types of deals, Stan, in that dynamic. And you are very astute. It goes from being a tailwind to a headwind. Now to be clear, we still see a lot of opportunity this year around new ELA deals, but the way that ELA deals came in late in fiscal 2019 and into 2020 really created a growth rate over fiscal 2019\u2019s results that was a tailwind in 2020. That could turn into a slight headwind in 2021, but that is included in the guidance that we gave, Stan.\nStan Zlotsky: Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rishi Jaluria from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nRishi Jaluria: Hey, guys. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Peter, I wanted to follow-up on the earlier point you brought up about what you\u2019re doing with CRM Engage for the regions that are impacted by corona. Maybe just following up a little bit on that, it seems like CRM Engage is obviously really exciting product, but it\u2019s obviously a big process change for the industry. I mean, just maybe thinking ahead, is getting it in industry like life sciences that\u2019s maybe a little bit more resistant to change to adopt some more solutions like this, even if they\u2019re being forced to. Is that something that in your mind, could serve as that trigger point of, okay, they\u2019ve tried it, maybe because they\u2019re forced to, they\u2019re used to it. And now that helps maybe accelerate the adoption. Or is there a better way to think about that? And then I\u2019ve got a follow-up for Tim.\nPeter Gassner: Rishi, I think, you\u2019re right. This is going to business process change like this that involves compliance. Sometimes customers can be measured on that and they maybe might not adopt too fast. Now they\u2019re being forced to do some things. So I think it will \u2013 we will see a bit faster adoption of Engage as a result of this. So that\u2019s the real straight forward answer there.\nRishi Jaluria: Got it, okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then Tim, just going back to the acquisitions, really appreciate all the detail and transparency in terms of this quarter\u2019s numbers and next year\u2019s outlook. Just wanted maybe dial into the gross margin implications from the acquisition. So Physicians World, very services heavy, get that was on gross margin. How do we think about the gross margin implications from Crossix net of the accounting for acquisition? Thanks.\nTim Cabral: Yes. So if you look at our Q4 results, Rishi, and into fiscal 2021. I would think that there\u2019s roughly \u2013 or we\u2019re expecting to be roughly about at 200-ish basis points impact to gross margins from those acquisitions. And as you realize you\u2019ll see some of that in our subscription gross margin, where Crossix is the majority of subscription and a little bit of it in our services gross margin, where Physicians World is all services revenue.\nRishi Jaluria: All right, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bhavan Suri from William Blair. Your line is open.\nBhavan Suri: Hey, guys. Congrats and thanks for taking my call. I guess, I just wanted to touch a little bit on EDC or CDMS now. When you look at the primary competitor in that space at least the more modern primary competitor taken out by do so. And if I think about 2020 was a very big renewal year for them. As you think about the potential to capture that opportunity, I\u2019d love to get some color on sort of how you\u2019re thinking about that market. How you guys are evolving, because obviously with these are one top 20 pharma when in the Phase 3 clinical trial space, you\u2019re set up well. So just trying to understand how the business is going to evolve this year and how you\u2019re thinking about the opportunity vis-\u00e0-vis sort of the competitive being acquired and this being a big renewal year for them.\nPeter Gassner: Right. I guess, step back at a high level for Development Cloud, that\u2019s our Vault in R&D area. I think it\u2019s important to know that\u2019s a very large area for us and it\u2019s very connected. The eTMF and the CTMS connected to the EDC connected to the safety, connected to the regulatory. That\u2019s a big, broad area for us. And it\u2019s very early days. It\u2019s less than 10% penetrated. So our goal is to have applications and products that we become the market leader in. And that\u2019s where we can be really the trusted partner of the industry over the long-term. Some of them we have quite some progress on and some of them are quite new. CDMS particularly, that\u2019s where we\u2019re quite new. So we\u2019re still early there, 60 trials, that\u2019s not that many. But what we\u2019re seeing is we\u2019re very well positioned for leadership into the future. It\u2019s the product innovation and the customer success we\u2019re having. So we\u2019re actually being very measured on the projects that we take on right now. We\u2019re laser focused on customer success of these projects. We\u2019re about to start a very large trial for a customer, multiple, multiple sites around the world, hundreds of sites around the world in multiple countries. We\u2019re just laser focused on the customer success. And then I think the market will take care of itself, because what the customers are looking for is not just CDMS only. They\u2019re looking for the whole suite of Development Cloud integrated in together on one common platform. I think it\u2019s important to remember that\u2019s the vision we started out with back in 2011 and it takes a long time to build up with some serious engineering work. So that\u2019s really what we\u2019re focused on, we have our eye on that prize. That\u2019s the type of thing that gives us confidence in our 2025 goals. So that\u2019s really where our focuses of the company is out to that 2025.\nBhavan Suri: Got it. Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then I just want to touch on an open-date a little bit. We\u2019ve talked about this in the past and they\u2019ve been some challenges given sort of the competitive environment given sort of the one data asset that was owned by IMS Health, obviously not part of the IQVIA. But it feels like OpenData seems to be doing \u2013 it seems to have been doing better maybe, or maybe it\u2019s exceeding maybe our limited expectations from outside. I\u2019m just trying to understand, has anything changed there? Have you added something to that? Is there \u2013 you talked about data in China. But is there something unique there that sort of helping that business maybe see a little more growth than it has in the past. How should we think about that going forward both from network and from KOL and the other pieces of that business?\nPeter Gassner: I think the story of OpenData is just a superior data product. And we just buckling down year after year and improving that data product, improving that service and having the OpenData use policy that we have IMS or IQVIA has very restrictive policies that customers don\u2019t like. So that\u2019s all to the production, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing some new customers. To the con, OpenData is also affected by the IQVIA anticompetitive policies. So when customers want to match our OpenData with other IQVIA products, they\u2019re prevented from doing that. Therefore, it impacts our OpenData sales. Make no mistake, our OpenData sales would be significantly better without these anticompetitive products. And what\u2019s causing us to win is just the product superiority. And what\u2019s causing the tailwinds is this antitrust issue, which we\u2019re progressing well. We have about two more years until the trial, and that\u2019s a jury trial. We feel confident in our outcome, but there\u2019s no guarantee. But at least two years, it\u2019s pretty defined timeframe here, and we\u2019re hoping to get the right verdict. Also, I would say thanks to the customers. I\u2019d just call out the customers. Thanks to the customers who largely finished the depositions in the case. And there were six customers that testified about the anticompetitive tactics of IQVIA harming the industry. So we\u2019re really grateful to those customers and their testimony.\nBhavan Suri: Thanks. Just a follow-up with that, just thinking about the customers, but thank you for taking my questions.\nPeter Gassner: I was reading your mind. I think that\u2019s okay in these types of situations.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sterling Auty from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nSterling Auty: Yes, thanks. Hi guys. So in looking at both the Vault growth in the quarter and the outlook, can you help us understand how much of that Vault growth is coming from adding additional products because I think you mentioned the average is now between 2 million and 3 million versus adding more Vaults in cases where it\u2019s not an ELA versus new customers?\nPeter Gassner: That \u2013 I don\u2019t have the exact math on that. I think it\u2019s \u2013 I would guess it\u2019s roughly even, maybe skewed a little bit more to customers adding new Vaults. Why do I say that? Clinical is a big area. Regulatory is a big area, and quality is a big area. So we have three big areas that are sort of in their prime now. We have other very large areas that are not yet in their prime they are very early, such as safety and CDMS. So the three areas that are in their prime in the Development Cloud. And then within each Development Cloud, we have two or three major applications. So on average, it\u2019s going to be a mix of adding new applications into a Vault and new Vaults. And maybe to simplify, I guess, Sterling, I would say that\u2019s a 50-50 mix there, but we don\u2019t have that exact number for you at this time.\nSterling Auty: Got you. And then one follow-up. Just to remind, where are you \u2013 Tim, we love having you on these calls and would want to keep you forever. But where are you in terms of that process?\nPeter Gassner: Sterling, Tim and I are working on the search, and that\u2019s going well. I think it\u2019s important to remember that Tim is here until we can find the right successor and also through the transition. So there\u2019s no defined transition period. We\u2019re focused on finding the right person over the long-term, and we\u2019re seeing some good candidates.\nSterling Auty: Sounds good. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sandy Draper from SunTrust. Your line is open.\nSandy Draper: Thanks so much. I guess just a follow-up to Sterling\u2019s question. Pete, if you can maybe talk a little bit about the two top 20 RIM customers. Where \u2013 are they coming from similar backgrounds, both from eTMF, new to Vaults? Just sort of some context about the two top 20s that joined on RIM.\nPeter Gassner: Actually, one was \u2013 Sandy, one was a top 20 and the other one was a top 50, so just to be accurate on that one. The specifics of these, actually, both of them are headquarters in Europe. Now that\u2019s \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t read any particular pattern into that, but they happen to be both European-based. Both of these, actually, I would say, quite early on in their journey with Vault. I don\u2019t \u2013 they\u2019re early on, but I believe both of these have made an emotional commitment to the full Development Cloud suite. Now that emotional commitment is much different than purchasing-type commitment, meaning they\u2019re starting in regulatory, I believe I don\u2019t have the exact specifics, but I think that\u2019s the first application. But both of these customers evaluated the Development Cloud holistically, evaluated the concept of having Development Cloud holistically, actually before they bought our first application.\nSandy Draper: Okay, great. That\u2019s really helpful.\nPeter Gassner: Sandy, it doesn\u2019t always happen that way. Sometimes, there will be a particular need in a customer and they want to solve that need, and they will solve it before evaluating the full picture Development Cloud. And some other customers will be more measured and evaluate the full Development Cloud first before solving a specific area.\nSandy Draper: Okay. Yes, that makes a lot of sense. And the follow-up, my ears perked up when you talked about Crossix and talked about being transformative. I haven\u2019t had a chance to go back and search all transcripts to see if you\u2019ve used that word before with that acquisition. And I\u2019m just thinking back in early days, Vault certainly turned out to be transformative for the business. Just some \u2013 when you use that word, is it relative to the opportunity for that business, the opportunity to transform your existing products? I just using that word, just really would love to get some more thought behind what you see when you talk about being transformative. Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: Yes. It\u2019s very astute to see that. I use that word carefully because we\u2019ve now worked with the Crossix team hand-in-hand, day and day, hour and hour over the last 90 days. And that is how I feel about it. It\u2019s transformative. The cultural synergy is there, the product synergy, the innovation synergy. Their expertise around data and privacy and patient data is unparalleled. So I do think it\u2019s very similar about like Vault. Now much earlier stage, right, I might have talked to you about transformative potential involved in 2013, that type of thing. I might have talked about the potential to be transformative or 2014. So it\u2019s early days. Of course, when things are earlier, it\u2019s not as guaranteed how everything is going to work out, but it has the potential to be transformative. Transformative, meaning bringing us into new markets, changing the DNA of Veeva, changing what we look like by 2025.\nSandy Draper: Got it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Hynes from Canaccord. Your line is open.\nDavid Hynes: Hey, thanks very much. Congrats on the results. Pete, I want to ask one on the R&D suite. I think we have a pretty good idea of how your CDMS relationships can potentially scale to be pretty large overtime. I have less of a feel for how material your customer relationships and safety might be. So can you just try and frame that for me? And are those relationships where you start small and then scale like CDMS? Or do you typically land a little bit larger in safety?\nPeter Gassner: In safety, in general, what we\u2019re seeing right now is we actually land smaller than we do in CDMS. Because they\u2019re generally there, the revenue goes with the amount of safety case incidents the customer has. So right now, we\u2019re getting into quite small companies that have a low volume of safety cases. And this is also an area, I would say, in the safety area, where customers are very measured in their approach, very, very measured. So I think we\u2019ll go broad and small. It will be probably not jumping in the way of ELAs, things like that, that CDMS does. But it\u2019s very similar in its market size like CDMS, and it\u2019s very similar in that safety is needed by a very small company. As soon as you\u2019re starting to do a clinical trial, as soon as you have a medicine that\u2019s given to a human, you\u2019re going to need it. You\u2019re going to need a safety system. So in that way, CDMS and safety are parallel, but CDMS is revenue based starts up based on the trial versus safety is based on the number of safety incidents that happen. So it\u2019s a little bit different profile.\nDavid Hynes: Okay. Yes, that\u2019s helpful. And then second\u2026\nPeter Gassner: The other similarity, I would say to is, it\u2019s just these are areas. Safety is an area where there has been really not much innovation over the last years, I would say, even less so than CDMS in terms of innovation. So we feel quite confident in our approach. Also, safety has a tremendous amount of integrations to the rest of the Development Cloud. So if a customer is using our, let\u2019s say, our CTMS system or our CDMS system, there\u2019s a tremendous benefit of getting our safety system and then not having to build and maintain the integrations. So I think that will give us an advantage overtime as well. That\u2019s just going to take a while to play out.\nDavid Hynes: Sure, that makes sense. And then a bit of a hypothetical for a second question, but obviously, health care is a hot button political topic. And since it\u2019s Super Tuesday, figured out I ask the question along those lines. If there are attempts to rein in drug pricing, right, be it narrative or actual policy? And industry margins were to come under pressure, how do you think that impacts your customers\u2019 engagement with Veeva?\nPaul Shawah: Yes. Hey this is Paul, David. Thanks for the question. So clearly, good timing as we\u2019re approaching the election season in the U.S. I think our customers certainly think about this. I don\u2019t think they over think. When we talk to some of our customers about this exact issue, there, our customers are global. Veeva is global. The U.S. is one market. There\u2019s regulatory changes that happen in every market all the time. And typically, no one market really drives the overall business. So I think although there\u2019s concern and they\u2019re thinking about it, I think the impact may end up being slightly muted. And I think there\u2019s also a potential impact that where there\u2019s pressure on pricing, I think the other balancing side of that is increased access. When you may increase volume, you may reduce overall unit pricing, the impact may be net slightly negative. But I think there\u2019s thinking about that side of it as well. So I think our customers are being balanced and not being too overly really concern when they think about that. But this is all, I think you said it\u2019s hypothetical. We\u2019re projecting as much as you are on it.\nDavid Hynes: Not surely. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tom Roderick from Stifel. Your line is open.\nTom Roderick: Gentlemen, thank you for taking my questions. Congratulations on a nice finish to a great year. I know there\u2019s not a lot of precedence to this. But Peter, you\u2019ve been here since the beginning, and many of your team has been as well. As you think about sort of the response from the life science community to what we\u2019re facing with the coronavirus issues going on around the world I don\u2019t know what the right precedent is. Maybe you take yourself all the way back to when H1N1 was a topic in the community. How do you think the life sciences companies in the world and your customers sort of play this out as we go forward? Certainly, some will put more money towards R&D and search for a vaccine. Historically, does this result in a bump to R&D spend? And can that be a good thing? Can you just kind of take us through the longer-term, the mid-term impact of what we might be facing here?\nPeter Gassner: I think it\u2019s still early days in coronavirus. So any kind of a long-term prediction could be inaccurate because I don\u2019t think we \u2013 nobody knows exactly what the situation is going to be six months from now. My personal belief is this underscores the importance of core research and development in life sciences and how important of an industry this is for the world, right. So I think, overall, it will potentially attract people into the life sciences industry and potentially have a greater appreciation of the life sciences industry, especially as we\u2019re moving into precision medicine, which is the other revolution that\u2019s happening in life sciences, the ability to specifically target or repair a very specific disease, a very specific gene. So it\u2019s really a golden time for life sciences. And maybe coronavirus, in its own way, will shine a spotlight. I certainly hope one of our customers can develop a vaccine or a cure for coronavirus. And I think that will be a shot in the arm for the industry and really underscore the importance of this industry.\nTom Roderick: Fair enough. That\u2019s really helpful. I appreciate that. And for my second question, let me just kind of turn to outside of life sciences. You focused on three particular market segments or industries that you\u2019ve had some success in. Can you speak to what some of the customer feedback has been as you look at CPG and cosmetics and chemicals? How are they finding success with relation to the products that you\u2019re putting into market there? And do you kind of look at some additional verticals where you might find some additional success in 2020? Or should we kind of continue to focus on these three specific verticals as we think of outside life sciences this year? Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: Yes. For outside of life sciences, we\u2019re focusing on the CPG, cosmetics and chemicals. And within that, we\u2019re focusing on our Quality products, QualityOne; and our Regulatory products, RegulatoryOne. Customer feedback is consistent. They like our platform. They like our applications, and they like our long-term partnership approach. We don\u2019t feel like a vendor to them. We\u2019re focused on their success, and we\u2019re always thinking long-term and what we can do. So they like that. They like the fact that we are a company that knows how to handle large global customers. We\u2019re very adept at that, and they feel that. So that\u2019s a customer success type of feeling that we\u2019re creating and we\u2019re happy with that business. The growth there is steady and the customer success is good. In terms of new verticals, that\u2019s not something we\u2019re looking to do at this time this year, we\u2019re still early in those verticals that we targeted. So we\u2019re going to buckle down there and focus on the customer success.\nTom Roderick: Outstanding, thanks for your help, appreciated.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brad Sills from Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about CDMS. I think it was last quarter, you had your first Phase 3 trial win in the top 50. Are there more deals like that in the pipeline? Do you need more deals like that when you refer to your kind of very measured reference selling approach there? Is that the validation that you need in that market where you could start to see that tipping point in a replacement cycle in clinical? Just remind us kind of where we are in terms of reference selling and maybe even road map, maybe there\u2019s something coming with \u2013 on the road map that could be a catalyst for that business. Thank you.\nPeter Gassner: Yes. CDMS, remember, it\u2019s early. It\u2019s quite early, 60 trials. We\u2019re starting a major Phase 3 trial. We\u2019ve done Phase 3 trials before. So we\u2019ve done a number of them. But what we were referring to last quarter is we\u2019re starting a major Phase 3 trial with a large company, one of the largest trials they\u2019ve ever done. First patient in here for those types of things, I think, for that trial is going to be in a matter of weeks. So that\u2019s really where our focus is. There\u2019s a lot of momentum in the market. We\u2019re being very measured in how many customers we take on and that type of thing. And it\u2019s not to do actually with a product feature or anything that\u2019s going to unlock the market. But it\u2019s more as we get more of these large trials and enrolled and as we scale up our services support team and round out all the product features, that\u2019s when it\u2019s really going to happen. It\u2019s a reference selling model. So at some point in the future, I\u2019m hoping we have a customer summit and a customer says, \"Hey, yes, all our new trials, we put them on Veeva and we\u2019ve been running them for two years, and we\u2019re super happy. And these are the benefits we\u2019re seeing.\" That\u2019s when it really starts to flow. So it\u2019s a long-term game. We mentioned our commercial Vault. We have to remember, that was 2011 when we sold our first commercial Vault application, PromoMats. And roughly 10 years later there, we\u2019re in a real leadership position in terms of the market. CDMS takes a while, but I feel very confident in our position. Also, interestingly enough, since we started CDMS, since we announced it, there has actually not been a new entrant to the market. So I feel we have a good advantage. We have a leading cloud platform, and we have a good head start here. I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re competing with somebody. I just feel like we really have to focus on the customer success, and then things will turn out quite well for us.\nBrad Sills: Thanks, Peter. And one more, if I may, just in outside life sciences, I guess where are you in terms of building out the sales force to go-to-market. Those are obviously different verticals with a different domain expertise and go-to-market. You guys have been very kind of steady in building references ahead of building out a sales organization. I guess where are you in kind of your build-out of go-to-market in those three other verticals? Thank you.\nPeter Gassner: Outside of life sciences, there, we\u2019re \u2013 I would say the way to characterize that is we\u2019re going to \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a steady grower for us. And you won\u2019t see any type of a burst in terms of expenses, right. We\u2019ll be measured in the growth of our field, and that will roughly align. Actually, I think the growth of our revenue will outpace the growth of our expenses in \u2013 outside of life sciences. So it\u2019s steady as she goes. We\u2019re finding our group inside particularly actually inside CPG and cosmetics, regulatory and quality; chemicals, a little bit. Of the three chemicals, I would guess, it\u2019s not as far as ahead of the other two. So you\u2019re going to see nothing dramatic outside of life sciences from us, just steady growth.\nBrad Sills: Thanks, Peter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Merwin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nChris Merwin: Hey, thanks very much for taking my question. I just noticed for Commercial Cloud, it looks like customer growth accelerated really nicely there in 2020. And I know you called out a big customer win in SMB. So I was wondering if you could just talk a bit more about the improving traction that you\u2019re seeing in that customer segment and how also we should think about the runway there. Thanks.\nPaul Shawah: Yes. This is Paul. Thanks, Chris. SMB was one of the really significant drivers for us. We had a really strong year last year in Commercial Cloud overall, and SMB was one of those big drivers. And I think part of that is just the approvals that have been happening. If you look at the European market, the U.S. market, the FDA, the number of approvals has been quite high, and we are winning the majority of those. So we\u2019re driving \u2013 fortunately, we\u2019re in a position where those companies, they want to innovate. They want to do things differently. They need to have a very successful launch. They want to launch, in many ways, in a digital way. So they look to Veeva as their choice. So the number of approvals has driven some of that strength, hopefully that will continue in the life science space for many more years. What we\u2019ve also seen is the breadth of what they buy from Veeva, some small and medium sized customers come to Veeva looking for a CRM system and what they end up with is something much larger and much more significant than that, because they learn more about what is possible with Veeva and more broadly in Commercial Cloud. So that has driven some of the strengths that you\u2019ve seen over the last, really over the last couple of years, but in particular last year a particular strength in the SMB segment.\nChris Merwin: Got it. Thanks very much.\nOperator: We\u2019re out of the time for questions today. I would now like to turn the call over to Veeva\u2019s CEO, Peter Gassner for closing remarks.\nPeter Gassner: Thanks again for your time today, and thanks again to the team for all the work for the customer success and for the industry, trust and partnership that you\u2019re developing. I look forward to connecting with many of you all virtually at Morgan Stanley Conference tomorrow. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tim Cabral",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Q4 was a strong finish to another outstanding year. As a reminder, this is our first quarter with Crossix and Physicians World. And we are providing an additional level of transparency during this call to assist in your understanding of how these acquisitions impacted our results and will contribute to our fiscal 2021 guidance. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $312 million, up 34% from $232 million a year ago. Crossix and Physicians World contributed more than $19 million of total revenue in the quarter. Vault was 49% of total revenue versus 52% in Q3. For the year, total revenue was $1,104 million up from $862 million in fiscal 2019. Excluding Crossix and Physicians World, total revenue grew 26% year-over-year. For the full year, Vault represented 51% of total revenue as compared to 47% in fiscal 2019. Subscription revenue in the quarter totaled $254 million up 33% from $191 million in the prior year. Crossix contributed roughly $14 million of subscription revenue in Q4, which includes the impact of a purchase accounting write down of nearly $3 million. This contribution from Crossix represented an incremental seven points of growth in the period. Vault was 47% of subscription revenue versus 49% in Q3. For the full year, subscription revenue came in at $896 million up from $694 million in fiscal 2019. Commercial Cloud subscription revenue grew 15%, excluding the impact from Crossix and Vault subscription revenue grew 43%. In fiscal 2020, our revenue retention rate was 121%. This metric is defined in the earnings release and reflects annualized subscription revenue growth within existing customers. Net of revenue attrition and continues to illustrate the increasing value we are providing to our customers and the life sciences industry. Services revenue came in at $57 million, up 38% from $42 million last year. Excluding Crossix and Physicians World, service revenue grew 25% year-over-year. For the full year, service revenue totaled $208 million, up from $168 million in fiscal 2019. Non-GAAP operating income was $103 million, which came in above the high end of our guidance. This result was driven by revenue outperformance offset in part by a couple of million dollars of additional one-time commission expenses for both our core business and the acquired Crossix business. We added 489 net headcount this quarter, including the 384 Crossix and Physicians World employees joining Veeva. Fiscal 2020 ended with a total of 3,501 employees up from 2,553 a year ago. Moving to the balance sheet, deferred revenue is $469 million compared to $251 million at the end of the third quarter. Calculated billings for the fourth quarter came in at about $528 million, which includes roughly $9 million of net acquired deferred revenue, less the acquired unbilled receivables. After adjusting for this, calculated billings in the quarter was $519 million ahead of the high end of our guidance. Crossix and Physicians World contributed $35 million to calculated billings in the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect calculated billings of approximately $330 million for Q1 and $1,500 million for fiscal 2021 with 40% to 41% of those billings coming in Q4. Please remember that there are numerous factors that make year-over-year comparisons of this metric highly variable on a quarterly basis. Therefore, we do not believe it is a good indicator of the underlying momentum of our business and we do not manage to it internally. Our subscription revenue guidance and calculated billings guidance for the full fiscal year are the best indicators of our momentum. Elsewhere on the balance sheet, we exited Q4 with $1,087 million in cash and short-term investments down $408 million from the end of Q3. This reduction was mainly driven by the Crossix and Physicians World acquisitions. In Q4, operating cash flow was $39 million, which includes $11 million in excess tax benefit. For the year, operating cash flow came in at $437 million, including a total of roughly $50 million in excess tax benefit. Excluding the tax benefit, operating cash flow for the year was $387 million above our full year guidance. We had another strong collections quarter in Q4, including nearly $15 million we had planned to collect in Q1 of fiscal 2021. For fiscal 2021, we expect operating cash flow to be at least $460 million, excluding the excess tax benefit. Next, I'd like to share our outlook for Q1 and for the full year of fiscal 2021. For the first quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $327 million and $328 million with services revenue contributing roughly $63 million. We anticipate non-GAAP operating income of $117 million to $118 million and non-GAAP net income per share of $0.59 to $0.60 based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 159 million shares. Please note, we will maintain our non-GAAP tax rate at 21% for fiscal 2021. As a reminder, this rate is not something that we adjust quarterly and we'll evaluate it again next year. For the year, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $1,400 million to $1,405 million, which is an increase from the initial outlook provided on our Q3 earnings call. Within that number, we expect the contribution from Crossix and Physicians World to be between $105 million and $110 million in fiscal 2021. We expect subscription revenue to be roughly $1,145 million for the full year. Commercial cloud subscription revenue is expected to be roughly $585 million. Included in that number, we expect Crossix to contribute between $85 million and $87 million of subscription revenue for the year. This number includes the impact of roughly $2.4 million of purchase accounting write down, which we will see mostly impacting our Q1 results. Vault subscription revenue is expected to be roughly $560 million representing an increase of approximately 31% year-over-year. Before moving on, I'd like to provide some additional context for the Vault subscription growth outlook. As we near the end of the Zinc MAPS migration to PromoMats, Commercial Vault to successfully become the market leader and with our strong market share, we expect Commercial Vault growth to slow. Additionally, as we have disclosed throughout the year, fiscal 2020s subscription revenue benefited from both favorable booking linearity and a tailwind resulting from the recognition of unbilled revenue from multi-year contracts with ramping fees. Moving on, we expect non-GAAP operating income of roughly $500 million for the full year, a non-GAAP operating margin of almost 36%. Finally, we expect non-GAAP net income per share of about $2.50 for the year, based on a fully diluted share count of approximately $160 million. In summary, the team has done an excellent job delivering another record year. Given our focus on innovation and execution, we continue to be confident in our ability to deliver $3 billion in revenue in calendar 2025. Thanks for joining the call today. And I'll now turn it over to the operator for questions. Sure, Karl. Certainly, happy with the momentum of the Vault business and happy with the guidance. To your point in terms of comparing the fiscal 2020 results, and you're correct, 43% was the VAULT growth number there versus a 21 guide. A couple things to keep in mind... 31%, sorry. I said fiscal 2021 and 21% \u2013 31% guide. A couple of things to keep in mind and you're right, Vault Commercial, as we're nearing the end of the Zinc MAPS migration of PromoMats, we've really become the market leader involved commercial. And if this market share, we expect that Commercial Vault's business to slow a bit. But there was also a couple of favorable dynamics in fiscal 2020 that we don't expect to repeat this year. One is the favorable linearity of bookings and we talked about that through the year fiscal 2020. And the second was the tailwinds we saw from the recognition of multi-year ELAs. Again, we don't expect both those dynamics to necessarily happen on a consistent basis and we don't have that in our assumption of the fiscal 2021 guidance. But lastly, I would say, this is consistent with the way that we viewed the Vault, the Vault business. And this view definitely informed our early fiscal 2021 guide that we gave 90 days ago, as well as our $3 billion revenue target in 25. Sure. I think it was in part acquisitions. When we gave the guidance last quarter, 90 days ago, we had talked about the contribution from acquisitions being roughly $15 million and that came in a bit higher. Most of that was due to a smaller purchase accounting right off that we had anticipated as well as good performance from those businesses. I would say the other part of the beat, Karl was a more normal, stronger execution and stronger bookings in the quarter. And we also saw a little bit more services revenue than we had anticipated 90 days ago. And as we've talked in the past, it's sort of the lumpy part of our business. So those \u2013 that part of the business can move up and down even within a 90 day period. Thanks, Karl. Sure. So in terms of the fiscal 2021 results, it was about a 300 point tailwind for those particular types of deals, Stan, in that dynamic. And you are very astute. It goes from being a tailwind to a headwind. Now to be clear, we still see a lot of opportunity this year around new ELA deals, but the way that ELA deals came in late in fiscal 2019 and into 2020 really created a growth rate over fiscal 2019's results that was a tailwind in 2020. That could turn into a slight headwind in 2021, but that is included in the guidance that we gave, Stan. Yes. So if you look at our Q4 results, Rishi, and into fiscal 2021. I would think that there's roughly \u2013 or we're expecting to be roughly about at 200-ish basis points impact to gross margins from those acquisitions. And as you realize you'll see some of that in our subscription gross margin, where Crossix is the majority of subscription and a little bit of it in our services gross margin, where Physicians World is all services revenue."

            "name": "Peter Gassner",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Q4 was another strong quarter with results ahead of our guidance. Fourth quarter revenue was $312 million, up 34% year-over-year, subscription revenue grew 33% and our non-GAAP operating margin was 34%. Past year was an exceptional one for Veeva. We retained our deep focus on customer success and product excellence. We expanded our leadership position and passed $1 billion in revenue a year and a half ahead of plan. We accelerated our pace of innovation in established and new markets and we made a potentially transformative acquisition with the addition of Crossix. We've refined our operating model for driving innovation in existing markets while also creating new agile startups within Veeva. This gives our startups like CDMS and safety, the autonomy to be laser focused on new markets, while our core teams remain dedicated to transformation in their areas like in CRM for example, where we are embedding AI in ways that will fundamentally advance the industry. Also key has been the growth of our leadership team, which has expanded thanks to the exceptional new people we brought on board this year and the very talented people that have developed within Veeva. In all, we have set ourselves up well from a product, operating model and team perspective to execute on the major opportunities ahead and to achieve our $3 billion revenue target in 2025. Thank you, and congratulations to the entire Veeva team for their outstanding work this year. Now I'd like to share some highlights for the quarter and year. It was a record quarter and year for Veeva Commercial Cloud. We further extended our leadership in core CRM. Our bookings increased over last year and we also saw an increased pace of new customer wins adding 53 new customers compared to 46 the year prior. Our strength in core CRM is fueling growth in Commercial Cloud overall as companies look to Veeva as their commercial foundation for the future. For example, in the quarter, a cutting edge specialty diagnostics customer who was anticipating hyper growth expanded their use of Veeva CRM and adopted five additional Commercial Cloud applications enterprise wide. This seven figure deal with our largest ever in commercial SMB and shows the strategic importance of our solution for companies of all sizes. Veeva OpenData also had a number of wins in the quarter as we continue to gain momentum in the data market. One of our key wins was a top 20 pharma selected OpenData in the U.S. replacing their current solution, head-to-head they found our data was better and more expensive. This is key as they move to new selling models that required greater depth of information, agility and the vendor that operates as a true partner committed to their success. Also in the commercial area, I'm pleased to share that Crossix close the year strong with revenue coming in right on plans. The acquisition is going exceptionally well. The Crossix team has brought new DNA around patients and data into Veeva. Coming together we'll go well beyond what either company could have accomplished independently. We have an exceptionally strong joint vision and roadmap, which you'll hear more about this year. Before moving to Vault, I'd like to extend a special thanks to the Veeva CRM team for their rapid response to help our customers navigate the challenges surrounding the coronavirus. For Veeva CRM customers not currently using engage meeting, we are providing free access through September for field users in impacted areas. This allows reps to connect online with the doctors that depend on them for information about the latest research and treatment for their patients. In Veeva Vault, we had a best quarter ever capping off a great year that was driven by strength across product areas and geographies. We are winning more new Vault customers and existing customers are expanding their use. We closed the year with 715 Vault customers up 25% from a year ago and existing customers continue to buy more based upon their success with Vault and because of the benefits of having all applications on a single modern cloud platform. Our average Vault customer now has two to three Vault applications. The Vault platform has proven to be a unique and powerful asset allowing us to rapidly develop and scale applications across a range of areas. We now have 18 Vault applications in all. Regulatory is a good examples of momentum we were seeing across the Board. In the quarter at top 20 pharma and a top 50 pharma selected Veeva Vault RIM as their enterprise standard. These customers were struggling with a patchwork of legacy and custom built solutions. One will replace more than 80 systems with Vault RIM. Over the past two years, the size of the RIM subscription business has doubled. We now have more than 200 RIM customers and great potential as we look ahead. Clinical is another area of significant strength and opportunity for us. In Q4, we signed our 14th top 20 pharma for eTMF. Our established track record of customer success with Vault eTMF is providing opportunities for additional Veeva clinical applications as customer see the benefit of a unified solution on a world-class cloud platform. For instance, in Q4, an existing top 20 eTMF customers standardized on Vault Study Startup, they are the seventh top 20 pharma to standardize on Study Startup. It's been less than four years since we started expanding our clinical suite beyond eTMF and already a quarter of our eTMF customers have at least one other clinical application. I'm very excited about the growth we're seeing in clinical and the significant runway ahead. I'm also pleased with our progress in newer Vault products. Safety and CDMS are two of the biggest opportunities that we have on the R&D side and both are showing good early momentum. We have more than a dozen early adopters for safety and more than 60 studies have started on CDMS. These two areas are still small in terms of revenue, but we feel very good about the potential for these products to be market leading over time. This year will be an important one as we build our track record of customer success and continue to innovate in both areas. Outside life sciences for CPG, chemicals and cosmetics, we had a number of expansions and added some big wins with new companies, including a top 10 CPG company who will adopt QualityOne, and a top 10 cosmetics company to standardizing on RegulatoryOne. In reflecting on the year for this business and looking ahead, we set the right course in the Veeva Way. We kept our focus on customer success and doing the right things for our early adopters, which is helping establish Veeva as a trusted provider in these new industries. It was a great informative year for Veeva. We grew and evolved an important new ways. We have a big opportunity ahead and the right team, operating model, technology and focus on execution to fuel our growth well into the future. With that, I'd like to hand it over to Tim. All right. This is Peter. I'll take that one. First, our hearts go out to the people, the families that are seriously affected by this and we hope they have a speedy recovery. As it goes to our customers, they're really working hard to try to develop things that will help the situation, vaccines or cures actually for this. And we're helping our customers, where we can, but we know they're working around the clock. In terms of our business, we haven't seen project slowdowns yet or haven't seen any projects canceled. We've seen a little bit of slowdown as customers adjust to working remotely in some regions, nothing that would be material to our financials. In terms of Veeva, we're in countries that are heavily impacted where we have offices, we've instituted a work from home policy. Now for Veeva that's very normal. We handle video conferencing very well. We grew up as a very virtual company. So I believe we're well positioned to handle this. One of the things that we're doing, I mentioned on our script is helping the industry by providing free Veeva CRM Engage meeting licenses to our customers up until September. That way they can continue their interactions with the doctors that they need to and they can do that remotely. So in summary, our customers are working hard to provide the medicines here. There's no material impact to our business at this time. That's a good question. In terms of the profile of where people start for Development Cloud. I really haven't seen that quite changed much. They would generally start in one area where they have the most need. It will be in the regulatory area, a quality area or a clinical area. I'd say if there's any \u2013 if you look at a shift from maybe four years ago, I think we see a little bit more people starting in the quality area now than we used to, because our quality suite has gotten much broader. We have our QMS product, our QualityDocs products, which was our original one and our training product. So that's maybe a little bit higher, but it hasn't materially changed. They will start in the area where they have the most need. The smallest companies will generally start in either the quality area or the clinical area, because those would be the first needs of the smallest companies. This is Peter. I could jump in on that one. There's no particular pattern that would be applicable to all customers. In general, we're going to start small with a new customer. They're going to try us out in certain areas, a small trial-by-trial small revenue. It can graduate to an ELA over time, and that takes some time to work through. So there's no particular pattern there. I would say it's actually quite similar also to what we saw in the early days of clinical with Veeva five years ago. This was a pretty standard. It was a top 20 pharma in the U.S. diversified pharma. They're in oncology, many different areas \u2013 therapeutic areas. So their needs for data are quite diverse because they have to navigate a lot of complex health systems. The health system might be the Mayo Clinic, they or MD Anderson and all the doctors that are related to there. So they need a robust set of data. They had a set of data provided from a legacy provider and the service just wasn't quite what they wanted and the quality and quantity and expansiveness of the data wasn't quite what they wanted. So we were able to show them a better solution and they're migrating towards it. And that's a project that's long, but not that long, it's less than a year project. So it's a pretty down the middle \u2013 have been replaced. In terms of our data offerings, our OpenData that's \u2013 it's a market where it's country by country. So we're the market leader in China. We're doing a bit quite well in the U.S. here and in Europe. It's earlier for us and we are making progress country by country. So I'd say steady, steady as she goes on OpenData. Rishi, I think, you're right. This is going to business process change like this that involves compliance. Sometimes customers can be measured on that and they maybe might not adopt too fast. Now they're being forced to do some things. So I think it will \u2013 we will see a bit faster adoption of Engage as a result of this. So that's the real straight forward answer there. Right. I guess, step back at a high level for Development Cloud, that's our Vault in R&D area. I think it's important to know that's a very large area for us and it's very connected. The eTMF and the CTMS connected to the EDC connected to the safety, connected to the regulatory. That's a big, broad area for us. And it's very early days. It's less than 10% penetrated. So our goal is to have applications and products that we become the market leader in. And that's where we can be really the trusted partner of the industry over the long-term. Some of them we have quite some progress on and some of them are quite new. CDMS particularly, that's where we're quite new. So we're still early there, 60 trials, that's not that many. But what we're seeing is we're very well positioned for leadership into the future. It's the product innovation and the customer success we're having. So we're actually being very measured on the projects that we take on right now. We're laser focused on customer success of these projects. We're about to start a very large trial for a customer, multiple, multiple sites around the world, hundreds of sites around the world in multiple countries. We're just laser focused on the customer success. And then I think the market will take care of itself, because what the customers are looking for is not just CDMS only. They're looking for the whole suite of Development Cloud integrated in together on one common platform. I think it's important to remember that's the vision we started out with back in 2011 and it takes a long time to build up with some serious engineering work. So that's really what we're focused on, we have our eye on that prize. That's the type of thing that gives us confidence in our 2025 goals. So that's really where our focuses of the company is out to that 2025. I think the story of OpenData is just a superior data product. And we just buckling down year after year and improving that data product, improving that service and having the OpenData use policy that we have IMS or IQVIA has very restrictive policies that customers don't like. So that's all to the production, and that's why we're seeing some new customers. To the con, OpenData is also affected by the IQVIA anticompetitive policies. So when customers want to match our OpenData with other IQVIA products, they're prevented from doing that. Therefore, it impacts our OpenData sales. Make no mistake, our OpenData sales would be significantly better without these anticompetitive products. And what's causing us to win is just the product superiority. And what's causing the tailwinds is this antitrust issue, which we're progressing well. We have about two more years until the trial, and that's a jury trial. We feel confident in our outcome, but there's no guarantee. But at least two years, it's pretty defined timeframe here, and we're hoping to get the right verdict. Also, I would say thanks to the customers. I'd just call out the customers. Thanks to the customers who largely finished the depositions in the case. And there were six customers that testified about the anticompetitive tactics of IQVIA harming the industry. So we're really grateful to those customers and their testimony. I was reading your mind. I think that's okay in these types of situations. That \u2013 I don't have the exact math on that. I think it's \u2013 I would guess it's roughly even, maybe skewed a little bit more to customers adding new Vaults. Why do I say that? Clinical is a big area. Regulatory is a big area, and quality is a big area. So we have three big areas that are sort of in their prime now. We have other very large areas that are not yet in their prime they are very early, such as safety and CDMS. So the three areas that are in their prime in the Development Cloud. And then within each Development Cloud, we have two or three major applications. So on average, it's going to be a mix of adding new applications into a Vault and new Vaults. And maybe to simplify, I guess, Sterling, I would say that's a 50-50 mix there, but we don't have that exact number for you at this time. Sterling, Tim and I are working on the search, and that's going well. I think it's important to remember that Tim is here until we can find the right successor and also through the transition. So there's no defined transition period. We're focused on finding the right person over the long-term, and we're seeing some good candidates. Actually, one was \u2013 Sandy, one was a top 20 and the other one was a top 50, so just to be accurate on that one. The specifics of these, actually, both of them are headquarters in Europe. Now that's \u2013 I wouldn't read any particular pattern into that, but they happen to be both European-based. Both of these, actually, I would say, quite early on in their journey with Vault. I don't \u2013 they're early on, but I believe both of these have made an emotional commitment to the full Development Cloud suite. Now that emotional commitment is much different than purchasing-type commitment, meaning they're starting in regulatory, I believe I don't have the exact specifics, but I think that's the first application. But both of these customers evaluated the Development Cloud holistically, evaluated the concept of having Development Cloud holistically, actually before they bought our first application. Sandy, it doesn't always happen that way. Sometimes, there will be a particular need in a customer and they want to solve that need, and they will solve it before evaluating the full picture Development Cloud. And some other customers will be more measured and evaluate the full Development Cloud first before solving a specific area. Yes. It's very astute to see that. I use that word carefully because we've now worked with the Crossix team hand-in-hand, day and day, hour and hour over the last 90 days. And that is how I feel about it. It's transformative. The cultural synergy is there, the product synergy, the innovation synergy. Their expertise around data and privacy and patient data is unparalleled. So I do think it's very similar about like Vault. Now much earlier stage, right, I might have talked to you about transformative potential involved in 2013, that type of thing. I might have talked about the potential to be transformative or 2014. So it's early days. Of course, when things are earlier, it's not as guaranteed how everything is going to work out, but it has the potential to be transformative. Transformative, meaning bringing us into new markets, changing the DNA of Veeva, changing what we look like by 2025. In safety, in general, what we're seeing right now is we actually land smaller than we do in CDMS. Because they're generally there, the revenue goes with the amount of safety case incidents the customer has. So right now, we're getting into quite small companies that have a low volume of safety cases. And this is also an area, I would say, in the safety area, where customers are very measured in their approach, very, very measured. So I think we'll go broad and small. It will be probably not jumping in the way of ELAs, things like that, that CDMS does. But it's very similar in its market size like CDMS, and it's very similar in that safety is needed by a very small company. As soon as you're starting to do a clinical trial, as soon as you have a medicine that's given to a human, you're going to need it. You're going to need a safety system. So in that way, CDMS and safety are parallel, but CDMS is revenue based starts up based on the trial versus safety is based on the number of safety incidents that happen. So it's a little bit different profile. The other similarity, I would say to is, it's just these are areas. Safety is an area where there has been really not much innovation over the last years, I would say, even less so than CDMS in terms of innovation. So we feel quite confident in our approach. Also, safety has a tremendous amount of integrations to the rest of the Development Cloud. So if a customer is using our, let's say, our CTMS system or our CDMS system, there's a tremendous benefit of getting our safety system and then not having to build and maintain the integrations. So I think that will give us an advantage overtime as well. That's just going to take a while to play out. I think it's still early days in coronavirus. So any kind of a long-term prediction could be inaccurate because I don't think we \u2013 nobody knows exactly what the situation is going to be six months from now. My personal belief is this underscores the importance of core research and development in life sciences and how important of an industry this is for the world, right. So I think, overall, it will potentially attract people into the life sciences industry and potentially have a greater appreciation of the life sciences industry, especially as we're moving into precision medicine, which is the other revolution that's happening in life sciences, the ability to specifically target or repair a very specific disease, a very specific gene. So it's really a golden time for life sciences. And maybe coronavirus, in its own way, will shine a spotlight. I certainly hope one of our customers can develop a vaccine or a cure for coronavirus. And I think that will be a shot in the arm for the industry and really underscore the importance of this industry. Yes. For outside of life sciences, we're focusing on the CPG, cosmetics and chemicals. And within that, we're focusing on our Quality products, QualityOne; and our Regulatory products, RegulatoryOne. Customer feedback is consistent. They like our platform. They like our applications, and they like our long-term partnership approach. We don't feel like a vendor to them. We're focused on their success, and we're always thinking long-term and what we can do. So they like that. They like the fact that we are a company that knows how to handle large global customers. We're very adept at that, and they feel that. So that's a customer success type of feeling that we're creating and we're happy with that business. The growth there is steady and the customer success is good. In terms of new verticals, that's not something we're looking to do at this time this year, we're still early in those verticals that we targeted. So we're going to buckle down there and focus on the customer success. Yes. CDMS, remember, it's early. It's quite early, 60 trials. We're starting a major Phase 3 trial. We've done Phase 3 trials before. So we've done a number of them. But what we were referring to last quarter is we're starting a major Phase 3 trial with a large company, one of the largest trials they've ever done. First patient in here for those types of things, I think, for that trial is going to be in a matter of weeks. So that's really where our focus is. There's a lot of momentum in the market. We're being very measured in how many customers we take on and that type of thing. And it's not to do actually with a product feature or anything that's going to unlock the market. But it's more as we get more of these large trials and enrolled and as we scale up our services support team and round out all the product features, that's when it's really going to happen. It's a reference selling model. So at some point in the future, I'm hoping we have a customer summit and a customer says, \"Hey, yes, all our new trials, we put them on Veeva and we've been running them for two years, and we're super happy. And these are the benefits we're seeing.\" That's when it really starts to flow. So it's a long-term game. We mentioned our commercial Vault. We have to remember, that was 2011 when we sold our first commercial Vault application, PromoMats. And roughly 10 years later there, we're in a real leadership position in terms of the market. CDMS takes a while, but I feel very confident in our position. Also, interestingly enough, since we started CDMS, since we announced it, there has actually not been a new entrant to the market. So I feel we have a good advantage. We have a leading cloud platform, and we have a good head start here. I don't feel like we're competing with somebody. I just feel like we really have to focus on the customer success, and then things will turn out quite well for us. Outside of life sciences, there, we're \u2013 I would say the way to characterize that is we're going to \u2013 it's going to be a steady grower for us. And you won't see any type of a burst in terms of expenses, right. We'll be measured in the growth of our field, and that will roughly align. Actually, I think the growth of our revenue will outpace the growth of our expenses in \u2013 outside of life sciences. So it's steady as she goes. We're finding our group inside particularly actually inside CPG and cosmetics, regulatory and quality; chemicals, a little bit. Of the three chemicals, I would guess, it's not as far as ahead of the other two. So you're going to see nothing dramatic outside of life sciences from us, just steady growth. Thanks again for your time today, and thanks again to the team for all the work for the customer success and for the industry, trust and partnership that you're developing. I look forward to connecting with many of you all virtually at Morgan Stanley Conference tomorrow. Thanks everyone."

            "content": "Yes. Hey, Ken, this is Paul. I'll take that one. So let me come in at a high level on the competitive \u2013 the overall competitive landscape and then more specifically on what we're doing. The competitive landscape is pretty much similar to what it's been over the last year. Things haven't really changed all that much. IQVIA is our primary competitor, as you know, there's certainly regional competitors that we have, but they're the ones that are primary in terms of global kind of scope there. IQVIA has continued to be aggressive in terms of how they approach the market in of pricing and bundling. Some of their projects have been a bit more services oriented, instead of standard product. And I think over the short-term that sort of thing could work out. I think over the long-term custom projects are not great. From Veeva's perspective, we had really great success last year. I'm really proud of what we've accomplished. Peter highlighted that we had 63 net new CRM customers compared with the year before, where it was 46. So we've grown and we've actually expanded our share last year. And of those wins, most of them came \u2013 most of them were head to head with IQVIA, and many of them were IQVIA replacements. So I'm really proud of what we've accomplished. That's the results. The results, I think, speak for themselves in terms of what we're doing, where \u2013 we think our strategy is the right one, which is focus on product innovation and focus on customer success. So we're innovating within core CRM in many different ways. And Peter highlighted some of the AI that we're doing. We're also expanding our \u2013 the add-ons and we're innovating a new add-on areas and we'll continue to add new products and then we're relentlessly focused on the customer success side. So that's our strategy to make sure those sorts of things don't happen. I expect at specific accounts there could be factors that lead to a specific decision. But we're doing our best and we're going to continue to focus on innovation and customer success. 31%. Yes. Hey this is Paul, David. Thanks for the question. So clearly, good timing as we're approaching the election season in the U.S. I think our customers certainly think about this. I don't think they over think. When we talk to some of our customers about this exact issue, there, our customers are global. Veeva is global. The U.S. is one market. There's regulatory changes that happen in every market all the time. And typically, no one market really drives the overall business. So I think although there's concern and they're thinking about it, I think the impact may end up being slightly muted. And I think there's also a potential impact that where there's pressure on pricing, I think the other balancing side of that is increased access. When you may increase volume, you may reduce overall unit pricing, the impact may be net slightly negative. But I think there's thinking about that side of it as well. So I think our customers are being balanced and not being too overly really concern when they think about that. But this is all, I think you said it's hypothetical. We're projecting as much as you are on it. Yes. This is Paul. Thanks, Chris. SMB was one of the really significant drivers for us. We had a really strong year last year in Commercial Cloud overall, and SMB was one of those big drivers. And I think part of that is just the approvals that have been happening. If you look at the European market, the U.S. market, the FDA, the number of approvals has been quite high, and we are winning the majority of those. So we're driving \u2013 fortunately, we're in a position where those companies, they want to innovate. They want to do things differently. They need to have a very successful launch. They want to launch, in many ways, in a digital way. So they look to Veeva as their choice. So the number of approvals has driven some of that strength, hopefully that will continue in the life science space for many more years. What we've also seen is the breadth of what they buy from Veeva, some small and medium sized customers come to Veeva looking for a CRM system and what they end up with is something much larger and much more significant than that, because they learn more about what is possible with Veeva and more broadly in Commercial Cloud. So that has driven some of the strengths that you've seen over the last, really over the last couple of years, but in particular last year a particular strength in the SMB segment."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to hand the conference call over to Rick Lund, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you, please go ahead.\nRick Lund: Good afternoon. And welcome to Veeva's fiscal 2020 third quarter earnings call for the quarter ended October 31, 2019. With me on today's call are Peter Gassner, our Chief Executive Officer; Paul Shawah, SVP of Commercial Cloud; and Tim Cabral, our Chief Financial Officer. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding trends, our strategies and the anticipated performance of the business. These forward-looking statements will be based on management's current views and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the risks listed in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our most recent filing on Form 10-Q, which is available on the company's website at veeva.com under the Investors section and on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.  Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today, November 26, 2019. If this call is replayed or viewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Veeva disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today's call, but will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. On the call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today's earnings release, which is available on our website and as an exhibit to the Form 8-K filed with the SEC just before this call. As you may have also seen in our earnings press release, we intend to begin using our website as a channel of public disclosure consistent with Regulation FD. Going forward please monitor our Investor Relations website, in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings and public conference calls and webcasts.  Finally I'd like to remind everyone that we recently closed two acquisitions. Both of those transactions closed at the beginning of the fourth quarter and therefore did not impact our third quarter results.  However the forward-looking guidance that we provide today will include financial results for these acquired companies. Details for how we expect those acquisitions to impact the fourth quarter of this year can be found in today's earnings press release. With that, thank you for joining us and I will turn it over to Peter.\nPeter Gassner : Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Q3 was another strong quarter. Results came in ahead of our guidance, thanks to great execution by our teams across all areas of the business. Total revenue was $281 million, up 25% year-over-year. Subscription revenue grew 27% and our non-GAAP operating margin was 40%. I'll share a few highlights starting with Commercial Cloud. It was a very exciting quarter for our commercial business. We entered new areas with the acquisitions of Crossix and Physicians World. We continued our momentum with new customers and delivered success with existing customers. We furthered our leadership in core CRM winning a number of new enterprise and SMB customers. For example, a top 50 pharma selected as their standard in Europe to replace IQVIA based upon their experience with IQVIA and their success with Veeva CRM in the U.S. market. Not only are we continuing to add more CRM customers, we consistently deliver on our commitment to their success. 14 small and mid-sized CRM customers went live in Q3 across U.S. and Europe. In SMB, Veeva CRM implementations typically take just four to six weeks. These projects are faster reliable, because of the quality of our software and our services. It was another great quarter for the rest of commercial cloud as well. We saw particular strength in events management and OpenData. Customers are continuing to make the switch to OpenData and I'm also pleased to see large customers expanding their use of OpenData across markets. For example, a top 50 pharma selected Veeva OpenData for the U.S. operations and two other top-50 pharmas are each in the process of rolling out OpenData to 30 countries. We focus on customer success, openness and operating as a true partner to the industry. In contrast, IQVIA uses anti-competitive tactics and its monopoly power and data to restrict customer choice. This harms the industry and ultimately harms patients. In the past quarter we have seen IQVIA anti-competitive tactics become more extreme, especially as it relates to their one key data offering. I'm pleased to report that customers are starting to stand up to IQVIA on these issues and many are considering moving to OpenData. We're also extending commercial cloud with two significant acquisitions. The Crossix acquisition closed at the beginning of this month and things are off to a strong start. The team has a great cultural fit with exceptional leadership. Crossix brings depths in patient data and data science to Veeva. The operational integration is going well and we're starting to refine and execute our plans for new products and tight integration between Crossix, Veeva CRM and OpenData. Our customers are excited about their potential. I look forward to the impact that this can have on the industry over the long-term. This month, we also acquired Physicians World, a leading provider of speaker bureau services for the U.S. market, which complements our events management software offerings. Events is an area where speaker services and events software go hand-in-hand because of the complexity of logistics and compliance when organizing a physician-led educational event. Physicians World has been a strategic partner for many years. We have a long track record of success together. Now we\u2019ve joined forces to make it easy for our customers to get industry-leading cloud software and services from a single vendor. I'm really happy to welcome the Physicians World team to Veeva. These acquisitions made for a very busy quarter. I want to thank our corporate development, finance, legal, IT, HR, and product teams for putting in the extra hours to make this happen with speed and quality. Shifting gears to Veeva Vault. One of the major highlights of the quarter and our year was Veeva R&D summit, which had record attendance growing more than 40% to over 2,000 people. There's real transformation underway supported by Veeva Development Cloud. For the first time the industry has a suite of applications that span the full drug development lifecycle all in a single cloud platform. It was great to see so many customers showcase their successes and to work with them as they look towards the future. Vault had another excellent quarter across enterprise and SMB. I'll touch on just a few highlights in quality and clinical. A top 20 pharma in Europe selected QualityDocs as their enterprise standard to manage quality documentation. Their long-standing commercial customer and QualityDocs is their first Veeva R&D application. They struggled with a host of legacy applications in R&D and QualityDocs is now the first step in their digital transformation. We see a similar dynamic in clinical, where companies are turning to Veeva Vault as they modernize and unify their system landscapes. For instance a top 20 pharma customer also in Europe selected Veeva Vault steady startup enterprise wide in Q3. We now have six top 20 pharma standardize on steady startup to streamline trial execution. In CDMS we have been awarded our first large scale Phase 3 trial with an existing top 20 pharma customer. This is a very large study. It will cover more than 12,000 patients across roughly 700 sites in 32 countries. Congratulations to the CDMS team. Getting such a large study is a testament to the innovation that team is bringing to market and to their hard work making early customer successful. It's a great milestone and speaks to the maturity of our products and services. CDMS is advancing faster than we initially expected, thanks to great partnerships with our early customers. I expect to be out of early adopter mode by the end of next year and continue our measured expansion and product innovation from there. I will also share a few updates on Vault outside of life sciences. Overall I'm pleased with the team's progress to ensure customer success and product excellence. They've got their focus and are executing well against the opportunity in quality and regulatory for the chemicals, cosmetics and CBD markets. To put things in perspective that market, our initial market outside of life sciences is roughly the same size as our CDMS market. In October, we held our second annual customer event for CPG, Chemicals and Cosmetics hosting more than 50 companies in Chicago. Also in the quarter the team progressed well in our newer areas. We signed our fourth early adopter another CPG company for the new Veeva Claims application. And we had a major milestone and regulatory with our first CPG customer go live. We are now in active discussions with seven of the top 20 CPG companies. We're still in early adopter mode in this market and will be for another year or more. But this level of activity especially with large enterprises tells us that we're on the right track for long-term success. In all we had a great quarter and are progressing well against our long-term goals. Our focus on innovation and customer success and our ability to execute across multiple large markets positions us well to be the strategic technology partner to life sciences and to reach our $3 billion revenue run rate target in 2025. And now, I will turn it over to Tim for a discussion of our financial performance.\nTim Cabral: Thanks, Peter. Q3 was another quarter of strong financial results. Total revenue was $281 million, up from $225 million one year ago, a 25% increase. We continue to see strength in both Vault and Commercial Cloud. For Q3 of this year Vault represented 52% of total revenue, up from 48% in Q3 of last year. Subscription revenue grew 27% to $227 million from $178 million last year. Vault contributed 49% of subscription revenue, up from 44% a year ago, indicative of both expansion of Vault usage within our existing customers and new customer additions. Note that the recognition of unbilled revenue from multiyear orders with ramping fees was 110 basis point tailwind to year-over-year growth in the quarter. Services revenue was $54 million, up 16% from $47 million one year ago. As a reminder, Q4 has fewer billable days due to the holidays in our field kickoff, which will impact our services revenue and services gross margin. Our non-GAAP operating income was roughly $112 million, a 40% operating margin exceeding the high end of our guidance. Top-line strength mostly drove this outperformance. We achieved another record hiring quarter with 185 net new employees joining Veeva in Q3, bringing our total head count to 3,012, up from 2,482 one year ago. Moving to the balance sheet, deferred revenue was $251 million, compared to $329 million at the end of Q2. This resulted in calculated billings of $193 million in the quarter, which was ahead of our guidance of $185 million. This outperformance was driven by strong bookings quarter and better than expected services revenue. Please remember that there are numerous factors that make year-over-year comparisons of this metric highly variable on a quarterly basis. Therefore, we do not believe it is a good indicator of the underlying momentum of our business and we do not manage to it internally. Our subscription revenue guidance and calculated billings guidance for the full fiscal year are the best indicators of our momentum. Looking ahead, we expect calculated billings between $500 million to $505 million in Q4, and roughly $1,175 million for the full year. Elsewhere on the balance sheet, we exited Q3 with over $1.5 billion in cash and short term investments, up from over $1.4 billion at the end of Q2. This increase was driven by our performance in cash from operations, which came in at about $62 million and included $9 million in excess tax benefit related to equity compensation.  For the full year, we now expect cash from operations to be roughly $360 million, excluding this excess tax benefit. Please know this full year number includes one quarter of estimated impact from Crossix and Physicians World, which tend to have net cash outflows in Q4. Before going into our guidance, I'd like to provide some details around our recent acquisitions of Physicians World and Crossix. We acquired Physicians World for approximately $40 million in cash, and granted retention equity awards valued at $15 million. Physicians World has a revenue run rate in the low $20 millions and is growing in the single digits with operating margins in the mid-single digits. Nearly all of Physicians World revenue will be reported under professional services.  In addition to the previously disclosed details of the Crossix acquisition, please note that almost all of Crossix revenue will be reported under subscription revenue with the remainder over the next two to three quarters.  Lastly, these acquisitions have reduced our cash balance by about $470 million, which will be reflected in our Q4 balance sheet. We're very excited to have both of these teams join Veeva and plan to invest in both businesses going forward. Both deals closed at the beginning of Q4, and our forward looking guidance incorporates the impact of both acquisitions. In today's press release, we give detailed information about our expectations for how these acquisitions will impact our financial results for the fourth quarter. But please know that we won't be breaking this out separately next year and beyond, as we will be deeply integrating these new solutions into our Commercial Cloud business. Now, I'd like to share our guidance for Q4 and fiscal 2020. In Q4, we expect revenue between $296 million and $299 million and non-GAAP operating income of $100 million to $101 million. We expect the acquisitions to have a headwind of roughly 400 basis points to non-GAAP operating margin in Q4. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.51 to $0.52, based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 159 million. For the year, we expect total revenue in the range of $1,088 million to $1,091 million. We anticipate subscription revenue to be in the range of $888 million to $889 million. For the full year, we now anticipate organic Commercial Cloud subscription revenue growth of about 14% and Vault subscription revenue growth of about 43%. For fiscal 2020, we expect non-GAAP operating income of $409 million to $410 million, a margin of roughly 37%. We expect the acquisitions to have a headwind of roughly 120 basis points to non-GAAP operating margin for the full year. We are now targeting non-GAAP net income per share for the year between $2.16 and $2.17, based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 158 million. Let me wrap up by sharing our initial outlook for fiscal 2021. Please note we are still in the process of finalizing the plan and will provide our formal guidance on the Q4 earnings call. Currently, our initial outlook for total revenue is between the range of $1,380 million and $1,390 million for fiscal 2021. Within this guide, we expect subscription revenue to be in the range of $1,140 million to $1,145 million. Based on our early spending plans, we see non-GAAP operating margins of 35% to 36% for the full year, with the impact of Crossix and Physicians World, resulting in roughly 250 basis points of headwind. In summary, it was another great quarter. The team's outstanding and consistent performance has set us on track to reach our target of $3 billion in total revenue by calendar 2025. As always, thank you for joining the call.  And I will now turn it back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from the Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nSterling Auty: Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. You mentioned IQVIA in the prepared remarks. We've gotten a number of questions around the competitive displacements in the CRM side. Could you just maybe go into a little bit more detail into those situations and just how you're seeing that competition shaping up?\nPaul Shawah: Yes, hey, Sterling. Hi, this is Paul, thanks for the question. So I'll take that one. They did announce, I think their number was 70 wins historically and then I think they announced a couple of -- two small divisions of large enterprise customers. And those kinds of things are going to happen, we based on IQVIA as kind of aggressive discounting and pricing and bundling, combined with account specific factors, those sorts of things will happen. I don't see that as a trend. In fact, Veeva is gaining share, I'm really pleased with the progress that we've had in core CRM. Over the last couple of quarters in this quarter in particular, we've actually grown market share, and I think that's largely driven by the strength that we've had in the small and medium size business segment. Pre-commercial customers are going to Veeva they\u2019re betting their launch on a vendor and a partner that they can trust and then existing customers are expanding. So, I think, I'm really pleased with the progress and we continue -- our strategy really hasn't changed. We continue to focus on customer success and product innovation, and also executing, which is over the long-term, which is what I think customers continue to want.\nSterling Auty: That's great. One follow up just along those lines, for the investors that are newer to the story, can you help them understand this idea of the one key data, they look at and say, wow, they've got this data that seems to be almost must have by the customers and they bundle it into the CRM. Is there a risk that you could that you could lose market share before anything happens in the course or something else in the marketplace.\nPaul Shawah: So the anti-competitive behavior that we've seen from my IQVIA has been focused on primarily three of our products. Network is where it started, then Nitro and then more recently Andi. It has not been -- we haven't seen any impact on core CRM. So, I think it's unlikely that that will impact the core CRM business or have any impact on share really growth going forward.\nSterling Auty: Great, thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Wong with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. \nKen Wong: Great. Thanks for taking my question guys. Maybe the first one for, Tim, when we're looking at that fiscal 2021 revenue outlook, I know the expectation is you guys aren\u2019t going to really talk about the M&A too much there, but could you maybe help us unpack how much of that contribution is M&A specific versus what's organic.\nTim Cabral: Yes, Ken, we -- as we are -- as I said in my prepared remarks, we are deeply integrating these two solutions into our Commercial Cloud business. So it's not our intention to break out the inorganic piece specifically going forward. We wanted to do it this year to lay the foundation of the expectation of what those businesses will contribute especially after you take into account purchase accounting for the rest of the year, but that's not our plan going forward because we're integrating these businesses so deeply into the overall Commercial Cloud business.\nKen Wong: Got it. And then, as far as that -- I mean that 250 basis point headwind to op margins, I guess any sense for kind of how that fades away after next year. Obviously, I don't want to kind of guide to the following year, but is that something that we should expect in terms of investments will still be something that weighs on the business or more of a one year impact. \nTim Cabral: Yes, so, I think, there was two components to that, Ken, as you think about next year, one is as you said, and you heard Peter and I talk about these are businesses or solutions that we\u2019ll continue to invest in. I don't think that's a one year phenomenon I think that is probably over time. And the other piece of it is obviously some of the purchase accounting spills into next year, which also impacts the operating margin, impact that they have.  So I think that obviously goes away after the first half of next year. But I think that these are businesses that we're bullish about and we think with investment we have an opportunity for customer success and long-term growth opportunities.\nKen Wong: Got it. And then maybe a quick one for, Peter, you mentioned CDMS advancing faster-than-expected and will be out of early adopter phase next year. How should we think about what that means from a customer adoption perspective, is this typically when you might see the -- kind of the slow adopter fast followers kind of dynamic kick-in or is that -- should I interpret that differently?\nPeter Gassner: I don't think there'll be a rush so to speak, because customers have their natural time when they adopt these things and were not going to impact that too much and they will always start small with a system like that. So no I don't think they\u2019ll -- I think it will be steady progress. But start to be significant in revenue in the coming years. I guess, if we step back the main thing, the main news here is Veeva handling the most complex and the largest trials. That's really says the product has arrived and that bodes very well for our future.\nKen Wong: Got it, great. Thanks, guys. \nOperator: Your next question is from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Your line is open. \nBhavan Suri: Thanks for taking my questions guys and nice job there. I wanted to follow-up on Sterling's question a little bit on the competitive front. You touched, obviously, on the commercial side I'd love to see if you're seeing any more competitive changes on the clinical side. And then as you look at sort of the CDMS or specific EDC part of the clinical side any change in competitive environment given that obviously the big player there was acquired by yourself.\nPeter Gassner: I'll take that one in terms of the CDMS of the clinical side, now we're seeing no change in the competitive environment as we are really focused on our own execution with our early adopters polishing out that product and the service offering and getting ready for that to become a very big business on the CDMS.  On the broader R&D side Development Cloud also no changes in the competitive environment there. Development Cloud is really accelerating when you think about 2,000 people at R&D customer summit, that's one of the biggest events of the year in life sciences. So really there the momentum is increasing, I think customers are planning for Veeva over the long-term. On the Development Cloud these are very crucial systems, very sticky integrated systems. So customers are thinking 20 years down the road literally on these types of things.\nBhavan Suri: Peter, that's helpful. I guess, I wanted to follow up a little bit on that. So if we pick the first part of that. I think the first real Vault product if we go back to traditional nomenclature was eTMF. And given so that's been in the market longest a little color on sort of growth rates and penetration of that business, given it's the most tenured from that space will be really helpful.  Obviously CTMS balls kind of ties into the eTMF space, but letters and how eTMF has been doing. You touch on rim and other pieces but love to understand how that core first product is doing in terms of penetration and growth? Thank you.\nPeter Gassner: Yes, it\u2019s still growing quite nicely, actually. I won't get into the exact penetration rates, but growth as measured by bookings, that\u2019s happening very strong in eTMF this year. And you might wonder, okay, well, what -- how can that be? Well, it's a big industry with a lot of players. So, yes, our early adopters I would say we're into the middle of getting into the late majority. If you look at the classic Crossing the Chasm, there's still plenty of customers that don't have our eTMF yet. And also in life sciences, industry overall it\u2019s growing. And the number with move to precision medicine, the number of biotech is growing, is up significantly from when Veeva started in 2007. So the market is actually for eTMF has probably grown significantly since the time we introduced it in 2012 and it continues to grow.\nBhavan Suri: Thank you guys. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Your next question is from the Stan Zlotsky with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nStan Zlotsky: Hey, guys. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. So wanted to actually go back to the CDMS, the big win for Phase 3 drug trial, that one was very impressive to us because we didn't hear a whole lot of big success with like Phase 2 drug trials and now we have this mega Phase 3 dropping in at a top 20 pharma no less.  Maybe just walk us through, like how this one came together and are there similar type of engagements that you have in your -- on the horizon. I'm not necessarily saying for Q4 or anything else like that, but just as we look forward, is that -- is the product mature enough where it can very effectively handle these massive Phase 3 trials? And then I've a quick follow for Tim.\nPeter Gassner : Yes, this large trial, this was at a customer top 20 pharma that we have signed a long-term enterprise license agreement with. And then when they do that they were the first to sign a long-term enterprise license agreement with us in the top 20. When they do that, they will start with clinical trials that are smaller and less risk could be smaller Phase 3s and Phase 2s, Phase 1s. And when they're doing that our product is new and they're testing that out, but also they're adjusting their processes. So now they have their processes as it relates to Veeva figured out enough and our product has matured enough. Now they're taking on this very, very large trial. So that's kind of unique. We have no other customer doing that yet. But we have a number of customers we're in discussions with that could result into these long-term enterprise license agreements. So there's -- the level of activity is high when that's going to actually turn into a booking or sale that's something we can't predict, yet at this time, but the level of activities very high.\nStan Zlotsky: Okay, perfect. And a quick follow up for, Tim. On billings, as we think about the Q3 and Q4, anything to call out from a onetime standpoint, either in Q3 maybe affects or anything like that? And just how we should think about Q4 billings if there's anything to be mindful of other than the $30 million have calculated the benefit to Q4 billings from acquisitions?\nTim Cabral: Yes, Stan, no FX impact obviously -- it shouldn\u2019t obviously no Q3 impact of FX, in terms of Q4 and Q3 there is no onetime. And I think what you're hinting at is there a movement of someone's renewal date that changes the dynamic of the annual billings or the quarterly billings. No, none of that we saw in Q3 or we are projecting in Q4.\nStan Zlotsky: Perfect, thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question is from Bryan Peterson with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nBryan Peterson: Hi, thanks for taking the question. So wanted to follow-up on Sterling's first question on the CRM side of things, but it sounds like you're continuing to gain share there. I'm curious where we are in terms of market share? Where do you think that number could get to? And just maybe an update on the penetration rates of some of the add-on products? \nPaul Shawah: Yes, hey Brian, this is Paul. So, yes, we're north of 80%. I think we talked about a while -- a quarter or two back that we hit that north of 80% mark, it still growing. I think we can see -- pretty fair to see line of sight grew through to 90% after that it gets a little harder to predict. So that -- the share continues to increase and I think again it's tied to our ability to execute in the marketplace. I think customers are clearly looking for a partner who can deliver and make sure that they're going to be successful. So we're going to focus on customer success and innovation. So, I think that's 90% is probably clear line of sight to. But then after that it's maybe a little bit harder to predict beyond that.\nBryan Peterson: And any perspective on the attach rates of similar other products like Approved Email and some of the add-ons that you've had?\nPaul Shawah: Yes, so Approved Email continues to be really high. We've had -- it's north of 60%. And that's really driven by Veeva helping move the industry to become more digital, enabling the field teams to be able to communicate with customers via digital engagement. So we've really -- I would say we've been successful moving the industry there and our customers have had a lot of success doing that. Then if you look across some of the other add-ons events is moving quite well and that's north of 20%. And then some of the other add-ons like align are closer to 10% in terms of account penetration. So there's still a fair amount of runway for the add-on products in terms of the overall opportunity.\nBryan Peterson: Great. And maybe just one more follow-up on, obviously, we've seen two acquisitions in pretty short order here, curious appetite for additional M&A with the cash on the balance sheet? Thanks guys.\nPeter Gassner : In terms of other M&A, we are always looking, right? You look a lot, you don't purchase very many, but you look a lot and we happen to find to that really fit for us. So we'll always keep doing that. What fits for us is I can just explain that a little bit. It's when we find a cultural fit and a synergistic fit with the business and we have the right leader to run that business.  And when we can find where one plus one equals three. So we're always looking and sometimes we'll find those where we can add value for the customers. We can create new value and then we'll execute on that, but it's generally rare. You look a lot and you find a little.\nBryan Peterson: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. \nRishi Jaluria: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. First just wanted to maybe start off with a comment Peter you made in the prepared remarks on IQVIA and how you're seeing customers pushing back against their behavior and adopting OpenData. Is that something that if this trend kind of continues it can start to serve as a tailwind for adoption of products like Nitro that in the past have been hurt by the lack of access to data? And then I've got a follow-up.\nPeter Gassner : Yes, if we look at the set the stage for the overall concept here with IQVIA. IQVIA has some near monopoly positions in two types of data. They have the sales data area and then they have the reference data, that's the open data. And they're preventing that data from going into some of the Veeva software products. And that's harming the uptake of those software products particularly that's network, that's Nitro and that's Andi. As it relates to OneKey, there is competition there now we have OpenData. So some customers are moving to OpenData. Unfortunately in the case of Andi and Nitro, they would need the sales data and the reference data. So I don't see good progress for Nitro and Andi until we can resolve this issue completely with IQVIA, which will have to probably be resolve by the court.  Where we are seeing progress for Nitro, particularly, is in companies that use alternative data sources not in some markets, some certain types of countries not all companies will need IQVIA data for example in Japan there's another data provided there called Encise. It's making great progress in Japan, particularly, with Japanese domestic. So that's kind of the lay of the land there. The extreme behavior by IQVIA on OneKey is actually helping our open data business a bit. That's not going to be the magic that will unlock network or Andi or nitro we\u2019ll need a more fulsome solution for that.\nRishi Jaluria: Got it, that's really helpful. And then I just wanted to maybe go a little bit into if you've seen any -- if you have any updates for us on the Engage business if there has been any areas where you're seeing particular traction? And maybe how we should just be thinking about what the runway of Engage looks like from here since we've been talking a lot about Commercial Cloud today? Thanks.\nPaul Shawah: Yes, hi, this is Paul, and Engage is doing well, again, as the industry is trying to become more digital this opens up a channel for field reps to interact with customers remotely via live meeting. So it's really a way that's increasing access for customers so customers that may be difficult to see face-to-face or that want to interact with a pharmaceutical company online at their own convenience are using Engage and it's starting to catch on there. But it's a significant change management, remember this is an industry who\u2019s called face-to-face on customers, on doctors who were a long time for putting much effort.  And this is a change management from a rep perspective, but also from a doctor perspective. So the early what we're seeing with our early customers is they're getting great results. They're getting a lot of time with customers. Sales calls that may last between 15 and 20 minutes and they are also getting access to doctors that they may not have gotten access to face-to-face. So really significant benefit, but it will take time because of a change management. So I think as companies has learned more over time I think you'll start to see this market play out over the next couple of years where it becomes more standard, a standard way of doing business. I think it's still in the early stages, but the results are proving out to play out well. \nRishi Jaluria: Great, that's helpful. Thank you so much, guys.\nOperator: Your next question is from Scott Berg with Needham. Your line is open. \nScott Berg: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I got one and a follow-up I don't know who wants to take the first one, but it\u2019s Crossix acquisition. Spend a lot of time at Dreamforce last week at your booth [ph] there trying to understand what the product is and came away with a good understanding, but could you help us understand maybe how you take some of that marketing data and actually integrate it with the rest of your commercial cloud and maybe have a mutual benefit to sell all the solutions more holistically. \nPeter Gassner: Yes, so Crossix, if you look at the core what they bring to the table is data science and its understanding of patient behavior, backing that is hundreds of millions -- data on hundreds of millions of patients and millions of doctors in the U.S. and all types of data on that. So it's hundreds of terabytes of data and significant data science algorithms on that which Crossix uses to measure the effectiveness of digital marketing. Now, where we can take that in the future that's we're refining our plans right now. Like we have CRM, we have open data, we have Crossix. And we're making plans both to improve the existing Crossix products and to create brand new products, we're not ready to announce those specific plans yet, but we'll certainly let you know when we are ready for that, but overall it's exciting it's Veeva's entry into data science. And we bought a company that has 15 years' experience in it. We're really the thought leader in it. They were doing data science before there was the term data science. So I'm really excited about it\u2019s going to be a transformative acquisition for Veeva.\nScott Berg: Great, helpful. And then from a follow-up perspective, Tim, you had a big jump in unbilled receivables in the quarter. I think we all understand in a 606 world what causes that generically, but was there a certain type of contract or a certain set of products that made that jumps so materially from one quarter to the next, just trying to maybe help understand that dynamic as it was a little bit unusual from your recent trends.\nTim Cabral: Yes, Scott, one thing to note is when you look at the unbilled receivables number that you'll see in our balance sheet that is a combination of subscription and services. And we'll typically see that in Q3 because October becomes a pretty big utilization month for whatever reason for us. So that was helped by services quite a bit. There wasn't any specific new types of subscription deals that we closed in the quarter that would have impacted that, Scott. So I think it's similar to what we've talked about in the past, in terms of these multiyear ramping fee deals that do not have the ability for renewal on an annual basis. So I think it's the same type of deal. But in Q3 -- at the end of Q3, you'll see a little bit of a pop from services unbilled revenue there.\nScott Berg: Very helpful. Thanks again. \nOperator: Your next question is from David Hynes with Canaccord. Your line is open. \nDavid Hynes: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I want to ask about Physicians World. So maybe for Paul, a bit of a break from the norm acquiring a largely services business. So, I guess, the question is, do you see a big opportunity to sell events management software into their base? Was that part of the rationale for the deal? And then just standalone is there a significant opportunity for margin optimization in that business?\nPaul Shawah: Yes, David, thanks. So, the rationale was really driven by combining great software with great services. So what Physicians World does is the majority of their business was focused around providing logistics services to their customers. When a life sciences company does an event they invite a thought leader to talk to a number of customers. They often have to get a hotel, they have to pay the speakers, there's a bunch of logistics that are associated with managing that event. And that's exactly where Physicians World played.  Now these are really significant thought leaders they're important people to the life sciences companies. So you need to provide great level of service. And that's what -- that's exactly what Physician World provides to customers. So the opportunity for Veeva was to provide both of those under one roof. Because our customers were asking us, they wanted one vendor to make sure that it was really seamless and really fully integrated. And at least to have that choice of having one company provide an end to end solution.  So that's the -- that was the rationale for acquiring Physicians World. I'll let Tim comment on the kind of the margin optimization part of that.\nTim Cabral: Yes, so DJ, to Paul's point, this is very important that it would be high quality and white glove service. So I don't know if there's -- I wouldn't say there's no margin improvement potential, especially as that business scales out. I think the combined events software business and services business that we now have being delivered from Veeva. There's an opportunity there from a margin optimization both in terms of just normal margin and then add some level of economies of scale.\nDavid Hynes: Yeah. Okay, makes sense. And then, Peter, so you've taken a pretty prudent approach to scaling efforts outside of life sciences. And I know, this is the playbook you ran early days in kind of core life sciences markets. So I'm wondering, what is it that you're looking for and kind of your cornerstone OLS clients that could serve as a signal that the time's right to step on the gas in terms of incremental investment there?\nPeter Gassner : I guess what we look for is, do we have product market fit, do we have capacity, are we able to take on more customers and not have issues? So in the core market that we're going after now, we're getting close. We've got in the quality and the regulatory product areas in CPG, chemicals and cosmetics. We're having a lot of discussions in there. And so we're getting pretty close, but we'll stay in that market for a good long time here. It's a big market. It's about as big as our CDMS and we\u2019ll be very prudent if we -- if and when we pick another market outside of life sciences.  That's sort of the hallmark of Veeva, you really get laser focused on the specific needs of the product and the industry. Work it out with the early adopters, and then you know exactly who to sell to, and you have exactly the product you need. And that takes time.\nDavid Hynes: Got it. Very good. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question is from James Rutherford with Stephens Inc. Your line is open. \nJames Rutherford: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Got a couple questions on commercial, if I may. Paul, you talked about winning back that top 50 European pharma from IQVIA. Just curious given how they oftentimes discount these deals pretty heavily, and they try to lock in customers for in some cases three to five years. I'm just curious what the situation was here and whether this customer was one that went live and wasn't pleased, or was it a failed implementation that brought this customer back into the fold, any color you can provide there.\nPaul Shawah: Hey, James, thanks. So just to clarify on that one, this was a top 50 company and they had -- they have Veeva CRM, and they have Veeva in the U.S. marketplace. And they've been a long time Veeva customer in the U.S. and very, very successful. They also had IQVIA -- legacy IQVIA in the European region.  So they were operating, essentially separately regionally for a long period of time, which is common, particularly in companies of that size, where they have different systems in different regions. And what they wanted to do was to centralize and harmonize more globally. So they had a decision to make and they had experienced, deep experience with both Veeva and IQVIA and based on their experience and their -- kind of their -- they had to choose a partner that they could trust can execute on a global program. So they based on that and kind of our track record of success that we've had with them in the innovation, they chose Veeva. So wanted to be clear as to what was the context behind that they knew both Veeva and IQVIA quite well.\nJames Rutherford: Perfect. I appreciate that clarification. And a follow-up on commercial, a much longer term question. It seems like there has been a trend that physicians are having fewer and fewer in person interactions with sales rep. But the reporting that I've seen has said that newer digital engagement formats like email or virtual meeting may not necessarily be filling that gap entirely, with the implication being that physicians are perhaps pulling the information they need directly from the pharmas or something like that.  So I'm just curious given that you all see more data on these interactions than anybody else in the market, is that a fair description? And more generally, what do you think the long term role is for the pharmaceutical sales rep in this industry?\nPaul Shawah: Yes, it's a good question. And I would say that for the in person interactions that it's actually not really decreasing overtime. If you look at the number of reps, globally that are in the industry, that's actually increased a bit overtime it shifts a little bit by country, some countries tend to decrease and companies within countries tend to decrease and others tend to increase as their portfolio changes over time or drugs go off patent and then as new drugs are launched, they may reduce in one area and then increase in another area.  So the number of reps has been relatively constant. And as you -- as the market is launching more specialized drugs, they tend to be more scientific in nature and you need people, you need human beings and the relationship becomes really, really important to getting those drugs out into the marketplace and into the hands of the right customers and the right location. So, I don't see -- I certainly don't see -- I haven't the data does not show that it's diminishing, it actually shows it's pretty constant. And I see digital increasing at the same time. So when I look back at our approved email utilization and even newer with Engage the utilization is increasing overtime. So the industry by and large is doing digital, at the same time that they're doing roughly about the same, roughly the same amount of face-to-face interaction. And I think that's where it will trend for a while, particularly as the industry becomes more scientific and as the industry approaches more precision type medicines it's -- I think that mix will continue for a long time.\nJames Rutherford: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sandy Draper with SunTrust. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Stan Bernstein [ph] on for Sandy, thanks for taking my questions. A lot of my questions have been asked, but maybe to put a finer point on it. You mentioned IQVIA became more anti-competitive this quarter. Can you maybe elaborate on what exactly was escalated this quarter versus the past? And then, maybe as a follow up to what extent does Crossix have the capabilities to provide a data alternative to IQVIA? And Peter, maybe you already touched on that, but is there any potential to provide some kind of a data offset or data alternative to IQVIA? Thanks.\nPeter Gassner : Yes, the first question about IQVIA, just more -- I guess, more of the same from my from IQVIA but maybe more rhetoric from their field team. I guess that's some of the echoes. We've even seen in some of our Vault products where the customers wanted to put in some OneKey data and IQVIA said okay, can\u2019t put it into the Vault product. Now the reality is that OneKey data is not so important to the Vault products at all. So the customers just said, okay, we're going to go forward anyway and in one case it led them to using OpenData in one of those things. So that's the type of stuff they haven't done before, so I think they're getting a bit desperate or some type of thing and it's having a bit of a backlash in the customers. So that's one. And in terms of Crossix, do they have assets that we can leverage into other data products. Certainly there's a lot of healthcare data and assets that Crossix has, doesn't have all the things that we would need yet to do any kind of a sales data anything like that, but it's certainly something that -- it's not impossible that we do that in the future. We don't have any specific plans at this time. But it's always an option.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it, thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Merwin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nChris Merwin: Okay, thanks for taking my question. For Quality One you called out I think a CPG customers going live with the regulatory product and I know you mentioned multiple customers taking claims already as well. Can you maybe help us think about the magnitude of some of these deals or maybe how we should be thinking about milestones in general for Quality One as you continue to build up referenceable customers there?\nPeter Gassner: The things I think about when we have activity in the top 20s that really can move the needle for us not the initial activity, but over the long-term and as we look to have customers of $10 million a year or more revenue $8 million. So those would be milestones that we would look at. And that just takes time to build up and to do that you need to have multiple successful products into these large enterprises. And it all starts with A product somewhere in A division and even before that it starts with discussions building relationships and the customers really understanding their business. That's what I'm excited about over the last quarter or two, the depth of relationships we're building and the inquiries we're having and the discussions we're having.\nChris Merwin: Okay, great. And maybe just coming back to Crossix for a minute, it sounds like there's quite a bit of work being done not only in their products, but perhaps some new products as well. I know it's early, but is it fair to say that in the context of next year's guidance it doesn't really include any benefit of those new products or cross-sell with your existing sales force.\nPeter Gassner: New products for any new products we would make that takes a while too, first you got to make the products, you got to get a few early adopters. So even if you look at products that we announced three or more years ago things like safety or CDMS those are very, very early. So if you would look at them they're not very material to our financials now at all. So that takes years three, four, five years to get material.  In terms of -- you can see it in our financials in the investment right that's if you look at some of our investments going forward and the things I'm really excited about is that we continue to build for the future. So the level of investment I can call out three particular areas where we will have heavy investment that's in our safety product where we're getting a lot of customer interactions and we're -- we have new modules to build and we're doing that. So we have to build out the field team, the product team and safety there. Also CDMS more to build out on the product, more to build out on the field team as we see that business starting to ramp. And in the Crossix area that's where we'll look to our new product roadmap and what we need to build out there. So the three significant areas of investing that's what makes me excited, because that makes sure our future is bright all the way through 2025 and beyond.\nChris Merwin: Okay, thanks. \nOperator: Your next question is from Tom Roderick with Stifel. Your line is open. \nTom Roderick: Hi everybody. Thank you for taking my questions. So I guess on the first one, I want to kind of go back to the -- I think was Stan that asked their earlier just a question on the CDMS win and I think it's obviously a big deal to land a Phase 3 trial. Can you just talk a little bit more about the dynamics of what is required with that product aside from just sort of scale and being able to scale up to 12,000 patients along those lines?  What additional features were required for you to kind of get into this win I would imagine it was a pretty long competitive process. Perhaps you could talk about that. And then lastly at the Analysts Day you spoke about the clinical query language I know it's very early and probably customers haven't seen much of that yet. But what is the response been to the idea of a new and perhaps more flexible query language on the back end of that? Thank you. \nPeter Gassner: Yes. As far as the CDMS and the large trials what we need to do there, while there were a lot of things in the product, but around the product. So, for example, we talked about 700 sites all around the world, I think 30 plus countries have to get our support infrastructure, we had to get our support infrastructure, up to speed and very understanding about clinical because you're actually doing the end user support for clinical investigators in Japan, in Russia, et cetera. So that's an example of one thing we had to get ready. We had to have performance right, we had to have our performance tested, ready architectural things buttoned up, sample test environments, et cetera to handle that level of scale and complexity of data that going in there. And then administration, okay, how are you going to administer all these clinical investigators that are coming in around the world, you have to handle all the loose ends and the loose corners that only come with experience. Software's sometimes it can be like a person, you got to go through some bumps and bruises to get to maturity.  So it's just the maturity of the software and all the processes around the software, including the scale of our professional services team and our partner network. Nobody is able -- has ever run this large of a study on Veeva CDMS before and our approach is different. The technology is different, it's more agile. So there's different operating roles that need to be established inside of the pharma company and that all needs to get worked through the system. In terms of the CQL, I would say there's, I wouldn't say a handful, but certainly in the tens of people inside the industry who really get it what this CQL can be. It's sort of the early adopters who are thinking forward because have to remember workbench is not available to any customers yet. We're targeting towards the early part of next year for it be available to the first early adopters. So we haven't seen the impact of the CQL or the data workbench yet. So far the excitement is around the much better clinical data management system.\nTom Roderick: Outstanding. Okay, that's great. Thank you, Peter. Tim, simple one for you, maybe we have to wait on this, I didn't hear if you gave the RPO number. Is that something we just need to wait for the Q on or do you have that handy that you can share that with us?\nTim Cabral: I don't have it handy right in front of me right now, Tom. We\u2019ll have it in the Q for sure. Rick and I can -- well, we should wait for the Q. \nTom Roderick: I\u2019ll wait for the Q. Perfect, that's it for me. Thank you guys, appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question is from Brad Sills with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills : Great. Thanks, guys. wanted to ask about the 7 of 10 CPG firms that you mentioned, that sounds like great progress in pipeline, you're in discussion there for outside life sciences. If you look at where those customers are today, and what they're using, quality one for versus say some of the earlier wins, I guess, how are you seeing the use cases evolve outside life sciences, particularly within those -- within that CPG vertical, which sounds very good?\nPeter Gassner : Yes, we're having active discussions with 7 out of the top 20 CPGs. And what we see there is a lot of cross pollination between the quality area and the regulatory area. So that's a common theme. When we talk with the customers, we see a lot of concern and interest in environmental stewardship, a lot of knowledge of the consumer goods is always faster moving, faster moving all the time in different parts of the world.  So they want to get from innovation out to the short -- to the store shelf as fast as they can. A lot of concern about the environment and what they need to do to be environmental friendly and good stewardship of environment. So those are common themes. And the other one is looking for a partner that can scale across quality and regulatory to these companies that have over 50,000 people and they just have not had a partner that has been able to do that so far. So they would implement departmental solutions, maybe a quality maybe if they have 20 manufacturing plants, they might have 20 quality solutions.  Now they're seeing, okay, potential event to have a unified quality system or a unified regulatory system rather than one for every different country or every different plan. So that -- those would be the common themes.\nBrad Sills : Got it. Thanks, Peter. And then one more if I may please. I didn't hear you mentioned outside life sciences is one of the top areas of investment. Should we take that to mean that you're still kind of early on in your reference selling there such that maybe the investment cycle for go-to-market sales personnel might be longer term? \nPeter Gassner: Yes, I think in terms of -- we're certainly investing appropriately outside of life sciences. I think the delta in increase in spending will be actually larger in the Crossix in the safety in the CDMS. Because we see more product work there that we have to do over the long-term. We're still investing in outside of life sciences it\u2019s just that it'll be a little bit heavier in those three other areas.\nBrad Sills : Got it. Thanks, Peter. \nOperator: And our last question is from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. This is actually, Peter Birkley [ph] on for Kirk. Thanks so much for taking the question. You mentioned a couple of times you're kind of growing partner ecosystem, I kind of just wanted to see if you could dive into that a little bit further provide some color on how you're continuing to leverage this partner ecosystem to drive sales and scale both within and outside of life sciences?\nPaul Shawah: Hey, Peter, this is Paul. We -- when we think about providing solutions to our customers, certainly Veeva is a very significant strategic partner to the industry whether it's inside of life sciences or outside. But we\u2019re not only -- certainly not the only technology provider that any company will have. So really big part of our model is to be partner-friendly, and to give customer's choice, we have a very open partnership model even in areas where we have existing solutions. So the Physicians World acquisition is one good example. We made an acquisition in an area where we saw services being really strategic and a key area for our customers. They were asking us to get into that area and help them. Yet, we continue to partner in that same exact area. So we will -- we have other logistic services providers and we'll continue to support them for the industry. So our philosophy around partnering is to be very open to give our customers choice and to make it really, really easy for customers to do business, because we're -- we know that we're not going to be the only vendor in their landscape. And our mission is to help make our customer successful and part of doing that is making integrations and services accessible and really easy for customers.\nUnidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thanks so much. That's very helpful. Just maybe one quick follow-up if I can, just curious, if you can provide any color on the continued search for a CFO to follow-up with Tim.\nTim Cabral: Hi, Peter, this is Tim. So we continue to build the pipeline on that particular role. It's very important as you can imagine to both Peter and myself. So we continue to build the pipeline both identifying candidates and getting some interesting inbound folks and talking to our network of people who know this role quite well.  One thing to remember and I think you do remember this Peter is I've committed to the Board and to Peter and the management team and the company here that I'm here until we bring that person on and get that person on-boarded effectively. So there's no real timetable for my departure. So it gives us the opportunity to really be thoughtful here, and that's what we're doing.\nUnidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thanks very much, Tim. Appreciate it again.\nTim Cabral: Thanks, Peter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Q&A period. I'll now turn it back over to Peter Gassner for any closing remarks. \nPeter Gassner: Thank you, operator. I would like to thanks everyone for joining us today. We wish you all a wonderful holiday. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tim Cabral",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Q3 was another quarter of strong financial results. Total revenue was $281 million, up from $225 million one year ago, a 25% increase. We continue to see strength in both Vault and Commercial Cloud. For Q3 of this year Vault represented 52% of total revenue, up from 48% in Q3 of last year. Subscription revenue grew 27% to $227 million from $178 million last year. Vault contributed 49% of subscription revenue, up from 44% a year ago, indicative of both expansion of Vault usage within our existing customers and new customer additions. Note that the recognition of unbilled revenue from multiyear orders with ramping fees was 110 basis point tailwind to year-over-year growth in the quarter. Services revenue was $54 million, up 16% from $47 million one year ago. As a reminder, Q4 has fewer billable days due to the holidays in our field kickoff, which will impact our services revenue and services gross margin. Our non-GAAP operating income was roughly $112 million, a 40% operating margin exceeding the high end of our guidance. Top-line strength mostly drove this outperformance. We achieved another record hiring quarter with 185 net new employees joining Veeva in Q3, bringing our total head count to 3,012, up from 2,482 one year ago. Moving to the balance sheet, deferred revenue was $251 million, compared to $329 million at the end of Q2. This resulted in calculated billings of $193 million in the quarter, which was ahead of our guidance of $185 million. This outperformance was driven by strong bookings quarter and better than expected services revenue. Please remember that there are numerous factors that make year-over-year comparisons of this metric highly variable on a quarterly basis. Therefore, we do not believe it is a good indicator of the underlying momentum of our business and we do not manage to it internally. Our subscription revenue guidance and calculated billings guidance for the full fiscal year are the best indicators of our momentum. Looking ahead, we expect calculated billings between $500 million to $505 million in Q4, and roughly $1,175 million for the full year. Elsewhere on the balance sheet, we exited Q3 with over $1.5 billion in cash and short term investments, up from over $1.4 billion at the end of Q2. This increase was driven by our performance in cash from operations, which came in at about $62 million and included $9 million in excess tax benefit related to equity compensation.  For the full year, we now expect cash from operations to be roughly $360 million, excluding this excess tax benefit. Please know this full year number includes one quarter of estimated impact from Crossix and Physicians World, which tend to have net cash outflows in Q4. Before going into our guidance, I'd like to provide some details around our recent acquisitions of Physicians World and Crossix. We acquired Physicians World for approximately $40 million in cash, and granted retention equity awards valued at $15 million. Physicians World has a revenue run rate in the low $20 millions and is growing in the single digits with operating margins in the mid-single digits. Nearly all of Physicians World revenue will be reported under professional services.  In addition to the previously disclosed details of the Crossix acquisition, please note that almost all of Crossix revenue will be reported under subscription revenue with the remainder over the next two to three quarters.  Lastly, these acquisitions have reduced our cash balance by about $470 million, which will be reflected in our Q4 balance sheet. We're very excited to have both of these teams join Veeva and plan to invest in both businesses going forward. Both deals closed at the beginning of Q4, and our forward looking guidance incorporates the impact of both acquisitions. In today's press release, we give detailed information about our expectations for how these acquisitions will impact our financial results for the fourth quarter. But please know that we won't be breaking this out separately next year and beyond, as we will be deeply integrating these new solutions into our Commercial Cloud business. Now, I'd like to share our guidance for Q4 and fiscal 2020. In Q4, we expect revenue between $296 million and $299 million and non-GAAP operating income of $100 million to $101 million. We expect the acquisitions to have a headwind of roughly 400 basis points to non-GAAP operating margin in Q4. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.51 to $0.52, based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 159 million. For the year, we expect total revenue in the range of $1,088 million to $1,091 million. We anticipate subscription revenue to be in the range of $888 million to $889 million. For the full year, we now anticipate organic Commercial Cloud subscription revenue growth of about 14% and Vault subscription revenue growth of about 43%. For fiscal 2020, we expect non-GAAP operating income of $409 million to $410 million, a margin of roughly 37%. We expect the acquisitions to have a headwind of roughly 120 basis points to non-GAAP operating margin for the full year. We are now targeting non-GAAP net income per share for the year between $2.16 and $2.17, based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 158 million. Let me wrap up by sharing our initial outlook for fiscal 2021. Please note we are still in the process of finalizing the plan and will provide our formal guidance on the Q4 earnings call. Currently, our initial outlook for total revenue is between the range of $1,380 million and $1,390 million for fiscal 2021. Within this guide, we expect subscription revenue to be in the range of $1,140 million to $1,145 million. Based on our early spending plans, we see non-GAAP operating margins of 35% to 36% for the full year, with the impact of Crossix and Physicians World, resulting in roughly 250 basis points of headwind. In summary, it was another great quarter. The team's outstanding and consistent performance has set us on track to reach our target of $3 billion in total revenue by calendar 2025. As always, thank you for joining the call.  And I will now turn it back to the operator for questions. Yes, Ken, we -- as we are -- as I said in my prepared remarks, we are deeply integrating these two solutions into our Commercial Cloud business. So it's not our intention to break out the inorganic piece specifically going forward. We wanted to do it this year to lay the foundation of the expectation of what those businesses will contribute especially after you take into account purchase accounting for the rest of the year, but that's not our plan going forward because we're integrating these businesses so deeply into the overall Commercial Cloud business. Yes, so, I think, there was two components to that, Ken, as you think about next year, one is as you said, and you heard Peter and I talk about these are businesses or solutions that we'll continue to invest in. I don't think that's a one year phenomenon I think that is probably over time. And the other piece of it is obviously some of the purchase accounting spills into next year, which also impacts the operating margin, impact that they have.  So I think that obviously goes away after the first half of next year. But I think that these are businesses that we're bullish about and we think with investment we have an opportunity for customer success and long-term growth opportunities. Yes, Stan, no FX impact obviously -- it shouldn't obviously no Q3 impact of FX, in terms of Q4 and Q3 there is no onetime. And I think what you're hinting at is there a movement of someone's renewal date that changes the dynamic of the annual billings or the quarterly billings. No, none of that we saw in Q3 or we are projecting in Q4. Yes, Scott, one thing to note is when you look at the unbilled receivables number that you'll see in our balance sheet that is a combination of subscription and services. And we'll typically see that in Q3 because October becomes a pretty big utilization month for whatever reason for us. So that was helped by services quite a bit. There wasn't any specific new types of subscription deals that we closed in the quarter that would have impacted that, Scott. So I think it's similar to what we've talked about in the past, in terms of these multiyear ramping fee deals that do not have the ability for renewal on an annual basis. So I think it's the same type of deal. But in Q3 -- at the end of Q3, you'll see a little bit of a pop from services unbilled revenue there. Yes, so DJ, to Paul's point, this is very important that it would be high quality and white glove service. So I don't know if there's -- I wouldn't say there's no margin improvement potential, especially as that business scales out. I think the combined events software business and services business that we now have being delivered from Veeva. There's an opportunity there from a margin optimization both in terms of just normal margin and then add some level of economies of scale. I don't have it handy right in front of me right now, Tom. We'll have it in the Q for sure. Rick and I can -- well, we should wait for the Q. Hi, Peter, this is Tim. So we continue to build the pipeline on that particular role. It's very important as you can imagine to both Peter and myself. So we continue to build the pipeline both identifying candidates and getting some interesting inbound folks and talking to our network of people who know this role quite well.  One thing to remember and I think you do remember this Peter is I've committed to the Board and to Peter and the management team and the company here that I'm here until we bring that person on and get that person on-boarded effectively. So there's no real timetable for my departure. So it gives us the opportunity to really be thoughtful here, and that's what we're doing. Thanks, Peter."

            "content": "Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Q3 was another strong quarter. Results came in ahead of our guidance, thanks to great execution by our teams across all areas of the business. Total revenue was $281 million, up 25% year-over-year. Subscription revenue grew 27% and our non-GAAP operating margin was 40%. I'll share a few highlights starting with Commercial Cloud. It was a very exciting quarter for our commercial business. We entered new areas with the acquisitions of Crossix and Physicians World. We continued our momentum with new customers and delivered success with existing customers. We furthered our leadership in core CRM winning a number of new enterprise and SMB customers. For example, a top 50 pharma selected as their standard in Europe to replace IQVIA based upon their experience with IQVIA and their success with Veeva CRM in the U.S. market. Not only are we continuing to add more CRM customers, we consistently deliver on our commitment to their success. 14 small and mid-sized CRM customers went live in Q3 across U.S. and Europe. In SMB, Veeva CRM implementations typically take just four to six weeks. These projects are faster reliable, because of the quality of our software and our services. It was another great quarter for the rest of commercial cloud as well. We saw particular strength in events management and OpenData. Customers are continuing to make the switch to OpenData and I'm also pleased to see large customers expanding their use of OpenData across markets. For example, a top 50 pharma selected Veeva OpenData for the U.S. operations and two other top-50 pharmas are each in the process of rolling out OpenData to 30 countries. We focus on customer success, openness and operating as a true partner to the industry. In contrast, IQVIA uses anti-competitive tactics and its monopoly power and data to restrict customer choice. This harms the industry and ultimately harms patients. In the past quarter we have seen IQVIA anti-competitive tactics become more extreme, especially as it relates to their one key data offering. I'm pleased to report that customers are starting to stand up to IQVIA on these issues and many are considering moving to OpenData. We're also extending commercial cloud with two significant acquisitions. The Crossix acquisition closed at the beginning of this month and things are off to a strong start. The team has a great cultural fit with exceptional leadership. Crossix brings depths in patient data and data science to Veeva. The operational integration is going well and we're starting to refine and execute our plans for new products and tight integration between Crossix, Veeva CRM and OpenData. Our customers are excited about their potential. I look forward to the impact that this can have on the industry over the long-term. This month, we also acquired Physicians World, a leading provider of speaker bureau services for the U.S. market, which complements our events management software offerings. Events is an area where speaker services and events software go hand-in-hand because of the complexity of logistics and compliance when organizing a physician-led educational event. Physicians World has been a strategic partner for many years. We have a long track record of success together. Now we've joined forces to make it easy for our customers to get industry-leading cloud software and services from a single vendor. I'm really happy to welcome the Physicians World team to Veeva. These acquisitions made for a very busy quarter. I want to thank our corporate development, finance, legal, IT, HR, and product teams for putting in the extra hours to make this happen with speed and quality. Shifting gears to Veeva Vault. One of the major highlights of the quarter and our year was Veeva R&D summit, which had record attendance growing more than 40% to over 2,000 people. There's real transformation underway supported by Veeva Development Cloud. For the first time the industry has a suite of applications that span the full drug development lifecycle all in a single cloud platform. It was great to see so many customers showcase their successes and to work with them as they look towards the future. Vault had another excellent quarter across enterprise and SMB. I'll touch on just a few highlights in quality and clinical. A top 20 pharma in Europe selected QualityDocs as their enterprise standard to manage quality documentation. Their long-standing commercial customer and QualityDocs is their first Veeva R&D application. They struggled with a host of legacy applications in R&D and QualityDocs is now the first step in their digital transformation. We see a similar dynamic in clinical, where companies are turning to Veeva Vault as they modernize and unify their system landscapes. For instance a top 20 pharma customer also in Europe selected Veeva Vault steady startup enterprise wide in Q3. We now have six top 20 pharma standardize on steady startup to streamline trial execution. In CDMS we have been awarded our first large scale Phase 3 trial with an existing top 20 pharma customer. This is a very large study. It will cover more than 12,000 patients across roughly 700 sites in 32 countries. Congratulations to the CDMS team. Getting such a large study is a testament to the innovation that team is bringing to market and to their hard work making early customer successful. It's a great milestone and speaks to the maturity of our products and services. CDMS is advancing faster than we initially expected, thanks to great partnerships with our early customers. I expect to be out of early adopter mode by the end of next year and continue our measured expansion and product innovation from there. I will also share a few updates on Vault outside of life sciences. Overall I'm pleased with the team's progress to ensure customer success and product excellence. They've got their focus and are executing well against the opportunity in quality and regulatory for the chemicals, cosmetics and CBD markets. To put things in perspective that market, our initial market outside of life sciences is roughly the same size as our CDMS market. In October, we held our second annual customer event for CPG, Chemicals and Cosmetics hosting more than 50 companies in Chicago. Also in the quarter the team progressed well in our newer areas. We signed our fourth early adopter another CPG company for the new Veeva Claims application. And we had a major milestone and regulatory with our first CPG customer go live. We are now in active discussions with seven of the top 20 CPG companies. We're still in early adopter mode in this market and will be for another year or more. But this level of activity especially with large enterprises tells us that we're on the right track for long-term success. In all we had a great quarter and are progressing well against our long-term goals. Our focus on innovation and customer success and our ability to execute across multiple large markets positions us well to be the strategic technology partner to life sciences and to reach our $3 billion revenue run rate target in 2025. And now, I will turn it over to Tim for a discussion of our financial performance. I don't think there'll be a rush so to speak, because customers have their natural time when they adopt these things and were not going to impact that too much and they will always start small with a system like that. So no I don't think they'll -- I think it will be steady progress. But start to be significant in revenue in the coming years. I guess, if we step back the main thing, the main news here is Veeva handling the most complex and the largest trials. That's really says the product has arrived and that bodes very well for our future. I'll take that one in terms of the CDMS of the clinical side, now we're seeing no change in the competitive environment as we are really focused on our own execution with our early adopters polishing out that product and the service offering and getting ready for that to become a very big business on the CDMS.  On the broader R&D side Development Cloud also no changes in the competitive environment there. Development Cloud is really accelerating when you think about 2,000 people at R&D customer summit, that's one of the biggest events of the year in life sciences. So really there the momentum is increasing, I think customers are planning for Veeva over the long-term. On the Development Cloud these are very crucial systems, very sticky integrated systems. So customers are thinking 20 years down the road literally on these types of things. Yes, it's still growing quite nicely, actually. I won't get into the exact penetration rates, but growth as measured by bookings, that's happening very strong in eTMF this year. And you might wonder, okay, well, what -- how can that be? Well, it's a big industry with a lot of players. So, yes, our early adopters I would say we're into the middle of getting into the late majority. If you look at the classic Crossing the Chasm, there's still plenty of customers that don't have our eTMF yet. And also in life sciences, industry overall it's growing. And the number with move to precision medicine, the number of biotech is growing, is up significantly from when Veeva started in 2007. So the market is actually for eTMF has probably grown significantly since the time we introduced it in 2012 and it continues to grow. Yes, this large trial, this was at a customer top 20 pharma that we have signed a long-term enterprise license agreement with. And then when they do that they were the first to sign a long-term enterprise license agreement with us in the top 20. When they do that, they will start with clinical trials that are smaller and less risk could be smaller Phase 3s and Phase 2s, Phase 1s. And when they're doing that our product is new and they're testing that out, but also they're adjusting their processes. So now they have their processes as it relates to Veeva figured out enough and our product has matured enough. Now they're taking on this very, very large trial. So that's kind of unique. We have no other customer doing that yet. But we have a number of customers we're in discussions with that could result into these long-term enterprise license agreements. So there's -- the level of activity is high when that's going to actually turn into a booking or sale that's something we can't predict, yet at this time, but the level of activities very high. In terms of other M&A, we are always looking, right? You look a lot, you don't purchase very many, but you look a lot and we happen to find to that really fit for us. So we'll always keep doing that. What fits for us is I can just explain that a little bit. It's when we find a cultural fit and a synergistic fit with the business and we have the right leader to run that business.  And when we can find where one plus one equals three. So we're always looking and sometimes we'll find those where we can add value for the customers. We can create new value and then we'll execute on that, but it's generally rare. You look a lot and you find a little. Yes, if we look at the set the stage for the overall concept here with IQVIA. IQVIA has some near monopoly positions in two types of data. They have the sales data area and then they have the reference data, that's the open data. And they're preventing that data from going into some of the Veeva software products. And that's harming the uptake of those software products particularly that's network, that's Nitro and that's Andi. As it relates to OneKey, there is competition there now we have OpenData. So some customers are moving to OpenData. Unfortunately in the case of Andi and Nitro, they would need the sales data and the reference data. So I don't see good progress for Nitro and Andi until we can resolve this issue completely with IQVIA, which will have to probably be resolve by the court.  Where we are seeing progress for Nitro, particularly, is in companies that use alternative data sources not in some markets, some certain types of countries not all companies will need IQVIA data for example in Japan there's another data provided there called Encise. It's making great progress in Japan, particularly, with Japanese domestic. So that's kind of the lay of the land there. The extreme behavior by IQVIA on OneKey is actually helping our open data business a bit. That's not going to be the magic that will unlock network or Andi or nitro we'll need a more fulsome solution for that. Yes, so Crossix, if you look at the core what they bring to the table is data science and its understanding of patient behavior, backing that is hundreds of millions -- data on hundreds of millions of patients and millions of doctors in the U.S. and all types of data on that. So it's hundreds of terabytes of data and significant data science algorithms on that which Crossix uses to measure the effectiveness of digital marketing. Now, where we can take that in the future that's we're refining our plans right now. Like we have CRM, we have open data, we have Crossix. And we're making plans both to improve the existing Crossix products and to create brand new products, we're not ready to announce those specific plans yet, but we'll certainly let you know when we are ready for that, but overall it's exciting it's Veeva's entry into data science. And we bought a company that has 15 years' experience in it. We're really the thought leader in it. They were doing data science before there was the term data science. So I'm really excited about it's going to be a transformative acquisition for Veeva. I guess what we look for is, do we have product market fit, do we have capacity, are we able to take on more customers and not have issues? So in the core market that we're going after now, we're getting close. We've got in the quality and the regulatory product areas in CPG, chemicals and cosmetics. We're having a lot of discussions in there. And so we're getting pretty close, but we'll stay in that market for a good long time here. It's a big market. It's about as big as our CDMS and we'll be very prudent if we -- if and when we pick another market outside of life sciences.  That's sort of the hallmark of Veeva, you really get laser focused on the specific needs of the product and the industry. Work it out with the early adopters, and then you know exactly who to sell to, and you have exactly the product you need. And that takes time. Yes, the first question about IQVIA, just more -- I guess, more of the same from my from IQVIA but maybe more rhetoric from their field team. I guess that's some of the echoes. We've even seen in some of our Vault products where the customers wanted to put in some OneKey data and IQVIA said okay, can't put it into the Vault product. Now the reality is that OneKey data is not so important to the Vault products at all. So the customers just said, okay, we're going to go forward anyway and in one case it led them to using OpenData in one of those things. So that's the type of stuff they haven't done before, so I think they're getting a bit desperate or some type of thing and it's having a bit of a backlash in the customers. So that's one. And in terms of Crossix, do they have assets that we can leverage into other data products. Certainly there's a lot of healthcare data and assets that Crossix has, doesn't have all the things that we would need yet to do any kind of a sales data anything like that, but it's certainly something that -- it's not impossible that we do that in the future. We don't have any specific plans at this time. But it's always an option. The things I think about when we have activity in the top 20s that really can move the needle for us not the initial activity, but over the long-term and as we look to have customers of $10 million a year or more revenue $8 million. So those would be milestones that we would look at. And that just takes time to build up and to do that you need to have multiple successful products into these large enterprises. And it all starts with A product somewhere in A division and even before that it starts with discussions building relationships and the customers really understanding their business. That's what I'm excited about over the last quarter or two, the depth of relationships we're building and the inquiries we're having and the discussions we're having. New products for any new products we would make that takes a while too, first you got to make the products, you got to get a few early adopters. So even if you look at products that we announced three or more years ago things like safety or CDMS those are very, very early. So if you would look at them they're not very material to our financials now at all. So that takes years three, four, five years to get material.  In terms of -- you can see it in our financials in the investment right that's if you look at some of our investments going forward and the things I'm really excited about is that we continue to build for the future. So the level of investment I can call out three particular areas where we will have heavy investment that's in our safety product where we're getting a lot of customer interactions and we're -- we have new modules to build and we're doing that. So we have to build out the field team, the product team and safety there. Also CDMS more to build out on the product, more to build out on the field team as we see that business starting to ramp. And in the Crossix area that's where we'll look to our new product roadmap and what we need to build out there. So the three significant areas of investing that's what makes me excited, because that makes sure our future is bright all the way through 2025 and beyond. Yes. As far as the CDMS and the large trials what we need to do there, while there were a lot of things in the product, but around the product. So, for example, we talked about 700 sites all around the world, I think 30 plus countries have to get our support infrastructure, we had to get our support infrastructure, up to speed and very understanding about clinical because you're actually doing the end user support for clinical investigators in Japan, in Russia, et cetera. So that's an example of one thing we had to get ready. We had to have performance right, we had to have our performance tested, ready architectural things buttoned up, sample test environments, et cetera to handle that level of scale and complexity of data that going in there. And then administration, okay, how are you going to administer all these clinical investigators that are coming in around the world, you have to handle all the loose ends and the loose corners that only come with experience. Software's sometimes it can be like a person, you got to go through some bumps and bruises to get to maturity.  So it's just the maturity of the software and all the processes around the software, including the scale of our professional services team and our partner network. Nobody is able -- has ever run this large of a study on Veeva CDMS before and our approach is different. The technology is different, it's more agile. So there's different operating roles that need to be established inside of the pharma company and that all needs to get worked through the system. In terms of the CQL, I would say there's, I wouldn't say a handful, but certainly in the tens of people inside the industry who really get it what this CQL can be. It's sort of the early adopters who are thinking forward because have to remember workbench is not available to any customers yet. We're targeting towards the early part of next year for it be available to the first early adopters. So we haven't seen the impact of the CQL or the data workbench yet. So far the excitement is around the much better clinical data management system. Yes, we're having active discussions with 7 out of the top 20 CPGs. And what we see there is a lot of cross pollination between the quality area and the regulatory area. So that's a common theme. When we talk with the customers, we see a lot of concern and interest in environmental stewardship, a lot of knowledge of the consumer goods is always faster moving, faster moving all the time in different parts of the world.  So they want to get from innovation out to the short -- to the store shelf as fast as they can. A lot of concern about the environment and what they need to do to be environmental friendly and good stewardship of environment. So those are common themes. And the other one is looking for a partner that can scale across quality and regulatory to these companies that have over 50,000 people and they just have not had a partner that has been able to do that so far. So they would implement departmental solutions, maybe a quality maybe if they have 20 manufacturing plants, they might have 20 quality solutions.  Now they're seeing, okay, potential event to have a unified quality system or a unified regulatory system rather than one for every different country or every different plan. So that -- those would be the common themes. Yes, I think in terms of -- we're certainly investing appropriately outside of life sciences. I think the delta in increase in spending will be actually larger in the Crossix in the safety in the CDMS. Because we see more product work there that we have to do over the long-term. We're still investing in outside of life sciences it's just that it'll be a little bit heavier in those three other areas. Thank you, operator. I would like to thanks everyone for joining us today. We wish you all a wonderful holiday. Thank you."

            "name": "Paul Shawah",
            "content": "Yes, hey, Sterling. Hi, this is Paul, thanks for the question. So I'll take that one. They did announce, I think their number was 70 wins historically and then I think they announced a couple of -- two small divisions of large enterprise customers. And those kinds of things are going to happen, we based on IQVIA as kind of aggressive discounting and pricing and bundling, combined with account specific factors, those sorts of things will happen. I don't see that as a trend. In fact, Veeva is gaining share, I'm really pleased with the progress that we've had in core CRM. Over the last couple of quarters in this quarter in particular, we've actually grown market share, and I think that's largely driven by the strength that we've had in the small and medium size business segment. Pre-commercial customers are going to Veeva they're betting their launch on a vendor and a partner that they can trust and then existing customers are expanding. So, I think, I'm really pleased with the progress and we continue -- our strategy really hasn't changed. We continue to focus on customer success and product innovation, and also executing, which is over the long-term, which is what I think customers continue to want. So the anti-competitive behavior that we've seen from my IQVIA has been focused on primarily three of our products. Network is where it started, then Nitro and then more recently Andi. It has not been -- we haven't seen any impact on core CRM. So, I think it's unlikely that that will impact the core CRM business or have any impact on share really growth going forward. Yes, hey Brian, this is Paul. So, yes, we're north of 80%. I think we talked about a while -- a quarter or two back that we hit that north of 80% mark, it still growing. I think we can see -- pretty fair to see line of sight grew through to 90% after that it gets a little harder to predict. So that -- the share continues to increase and I think again it's tied to our ability to execute in the marketplace. I think customers are clearly looking for a partner who can deliver and make sure that they're going to be successful. So we're going to focus on customer success and innovation. So, I think that's 90% is probably clear line of sight to. But then after that it's maybe a little bit harder to predict beyond that. Yes, so Approved Email continues to be really high. We've had -- it's north of 60%. And that's really driven by Veeva helping move the industry to become more digital, enabling the field teams to be able to communicate with customers via digital engagement. So we've really -- I would say we've been successful moving the industry there and our customers have had a lot of success doing that. Then if you look across some of the other add-ons events is moving quite well and that's north of 20%. And then some of the other add-ons like align are closer to 10% in terms of account penetration. So there's still a fair amount of runway for the add-on products in terms of the overall opportunity. Yes, hi, this is Paul, and Engage is doing well, again, as the industry is trying to become more digital this opens up a channel for field reps to interact with customers remotely via live meeting. So it's really a way that's increasing access for customers so customers that may be difficult to see face-to-face or that want to interact with a pharmaceutical company online at their own convenience are using Engage and it's starting to catch on there. But it's a significant change management, remember this is an industry who's called face-to-face on customers, on doctors who were a long time for putting much effort.  And this is a change management from a rep perspective, but also from a doctor perspective. So the early what we're seeing with our early customers is they're getting great results. They're getting a lot of time with customers. Sales calls that may last between 15 and 20 minutes and they are also getting access to doctors that they may not have gotten access to face-to-face. So really significant benefit, but it will take time because of a change management. So I think as companies has learned more over time I think you'll start to see this market play out over the next couple of years where it becomes more standard, a standard way of doing business. I think it's still in the early stages, but the results are proving out to play out well. Yes, David, thanks. So, the rationale was really driven by combining great software with great services. So what Physicians World does is the majority of their business was focused around providing logistics services to their customers. When a life sciences company does an event they invite a thought leader to talk to a number of customers. They often have to get a hotel, they have to pay the speakers, there's a bunch of logistics that are associated with managing that event. And that's exactly where Physicians World played.  Now these are really significant thought leaders they're important people to the life sciences companies. So you need to provide great level of service. And that's what -- that's exactly what Physician World provides to customers. So the opportunity for Veeva was to provide both of those under one roof. Because our customers were asking us, they wanted one vendor to make sure that it was really seamless and really fully integrated. And at least to have that choice of having one company provide an end to end solution.  So that's the -- that was the rationale for acquiring Physicians World. I'll let Tim comment on the kind of the margin optimization part of that. Hey, James, thanks. So just to clarify on that one, this was a top 50 company and they had -- they have Veeva CRM, and they have Veeva in the U.S. marketplace. And they've been a long time Veeva customer in the U.S. and very, very successful. They also had IQVIA -- legacy IQVIA in the European region.  So they were operating, essentially separately regionally for a long period of time, which is common, particularly in companies of that size, where they have different systems in different regions. And what they wanted to do was to centralize and harmonize more globally. So they had a decision to make and they had experienced, deep experience with both Veeva and IQVIA and based on their experience and their -- kind of their -- they had to choose a partner that they could trust can execute on a global program. So they based on that and kind of our track record of success that we've had with them in the innovation, they chose Veeva. So wanted to be clear as to what was the context behind that they knew both Veeva and IQVIA quite well. Yes, it's a good question. And I would say that for the in person interactions that it's actually not really decreasing overtime. If you look at the number of reps, globally that are in the industry, that's actually increased a bit overtime it shifts a little bit by country, some countries tend to decrease and companies within countries tend to decrease and others tend to increase as their portfolio changes over time or drugs go off patent and then as new drugs are launched, they may reduce in one area and then increase in another area.  So the number of reps has been relatively constant. And as you -- as the market is launching more specialized drugs, they tend to be more scientific in nature and you need people, you need human beings and the relationship becomes really, really important to getting those drugs out into the marketplace and into the hands of the right customers and the right location. So, I don't see -- I certainly don't see -- I haven't the data does not show that it's diminishing, it actually shows it's pretty constant. And I see digital increasing at the same time. So when I look back at our approved email utilization and even newer with Engage the utilization is increasing overtime. So the industry by and large is doing digital, at the same time that they're doing roughly about the same, roughly the same amount of face-to-face interaction. And I think that's where it will trend for a while, particularly as the industry becomes more scientific and as the industry approaches more precision type medicines it's -- I think that mix will continue for a long time. Hey, Peter, this is Paul. We -- when we think about providing solutions to our customers, certainly Veeva is a very significant strategic partner to the industry whether it's inside of life sciences or outside. But we're not only -- certainly not the only technology provider that any company will have. So really big part of our model is to be partner-friendly, and to give customer's choice, we have a very open partnership model even in areas where we have existing solutions. So the Physicians World acquisition is one good example. We made an acquisition in an area where we saw services being really strategic and a key area for our customers. They were asking us to get into that area and help them. Yet, we continue to partner in that same exact area. So we will -- we have other logistic services providers and we'll continue to support them for the industry. So our philosophy around partnering is to be very open to give our customers choice and to make it really, really easy for customers to do business, because we're -- we know that we're not going to be the only vendor in their landscape. And our mission is to help make our customer successful and part of doing that is making integrations and services accessible and really easy for customers."

Q2 was another strong quarter with results above our guidance. Total revenue was $267 million, up 27% year-over-year. Subscription revenue grew 28% year-over-year and our non-GAAP operating margin was 39%. Veeva has now passed the $1 billion revenue run rate. This is a year and a half ahead of the target we first laid out in 2015. With customer success as our driving force, we were able to exceed our goals through exceptional focus and execution. Thank you and congratulations to the Veeva team.  Today, we also announced our CFO, Tim Cabral, is retiring next year after a 30-year career and 10 years at Veeva. A search for his replacement is underway and Tim is staying at Veeva through the hiring and on-boarding of our new CFO to ensure a smooth transition. I'd like to express our appreciation and thanks to Tim. He's an exceptional leader, having helped guide Veeva from a start-up to our current scale. He also built a strong team. Working with Tim at Veeva and at PeopleSoft before that has been a true partnership that I value deeply.  Now turning to the details of the quarter. Strong momentum in Commercial Cloud contributed to our outperformance in Q2. In core CRM, we continued to extend our leadership position with new SMB customers, and additional enterprise expansions. And customers continued to adopt more CRM add-ons. This happens on a product-by-product and region-by-region basis.  Let me give a couple of examples. Veeva CRM Engage had one of its strongest quarters as four top 20 pharmas expanded their use of Engage to new field teams. Customers are attracted by the deep functionality and multi-platform support of Engage and the very tight integration with CRM. We also had an important design win at the top 20 pharma for events management. This customer has been using core CRM globally for many years and recently decided to expand their Veeva relationship to include events management in more than 90 countries over time. They chose Veeva because we have a deep functionality and professional services capabilities needed for a global event management rollout. They will replace multiple customer systems and spreadsheets, leading to a more efficient and compliant global process. It's great to see this expanding relationship with the longstanding customer.  Turning to Vault, we continued to have great momentum. Vault now has nearly 650 customers, and as of Q2, represents more than 50% of total revenue. This is an exciting milestone. When we started Vault a number of years ago, the potential was clear to me. And as I look ahead, it's also clear that we're in the early days of Vault.  This quarter, a newly independent top 20 medical device company standardized on Vault across the organization, including clinical, quality, regulatory, and commercial. With the ability to start from a clean slate, they chose Vault because it's the only solution to provide best-in-class application suites on a single modern cloud platform. Our customer-success focus and commitment to the medical device industry was also key.  In clinical, they will use Veeva eTMF, CTMS, and CDMS. Let\u2019s focus in on CDMS. They chose Veeva\u2019s CDMS over their incumbent system for a few reasons. First, they were looking towards the future and long-term partnership, so they liked our pace of innovation. They\u2019ve seen Veeva's CDMS evolve rapidly over the past 12 months and are excited about what's ahead. They also saw that Veeva's CDMS is well suited to running all their types of studies. It can handle the complex studies, but also it is practical to use to use for small studies that are built on short notice. And they also won clinical data management and clinical operations, all on a common platform to gain operational efficiency. We now have a top 20 pharma and a top 20 med device company as lighthouse customers for CDMS. These early adopter accounts are very important, and their success is a major focus for the team.  CTMS is also progressing well. We continue to win more deals and now have 50 customers signed in just two years since the product was released. That's amazing momentum in a highly complex area. Our progress here speaks to the significant need in the market for a modern CTMS solution. We believe Vault CTMS is poised to be the leading solution over time.  Drilling down into quality. We signed our tenth Top 20 pharma for Vault QualityDocs. Following their success with Vault PromoMats, eTMF and submissions, this customer selected QualityDocs as part of their move away from a legacy content management platform.  On the QMS side of quality, we ended the quarter with more than 100 customers. The need for modernization is driving the move to Veeva in this area, as is the benefit of having QMS integrated with QualityDocs and training on the Vault platform. This is another great example of the innovation we're bringing to an underserved market.  Finally, I'd like to give an update on our efforts outside of life sciences. I'm pleased with the progress we're making within our three focus industries: CPG, chemicals, and cosmetics. Since announcing the new Vault Claims product last quarter, we now have projects in place at three top CPG companies. We're also executing well in chemicals and cosmetics. Customer success drives our business in all industries. This quarter, we had major go-lives at a top 20 CPG, a top 20 cosmetics company, and two major go-lives in chemical. In closing, we had a great quarter. Our results reflect the customer trust we have gained through consistent innovation, focused execution, and our commitment to their success.  With that, I'll turn it over to Tim.\nTim Cabral: Thanks Peter. Q2 was another quarter of solid execution across the board. Total revenue was $267 million up from $210 million one year ago, a 27% increase. Momentum across Vault continues with Vault now representing 52% of total revenue, up from 46% in Q2 of last year. Subscription revenue grew 28% to $217 million from $170 million last year. Vault represented 48% of subscription revenue, up from 42% a year ago. Year-over-year growth benefited from particularly strong bookings in the first half of the year, and from 190 basis points of tailwind from 606, due to the recognition of unbilled revenue from multi-year orders with ramping fees. Services revenue was nearly $50 million, up 24% from $40 million one year ago. We expect services revenue to be roughly flat sequentially in Q3. We continue to see strong profitability in Q2. Non-GAAP operating income came in about $104 million, a 39% operating margin above the high end of our guidance. This was primarily driven by outperformance on the topline. We made good progress investing in the business with a record hiring quarter. Approximately 180 net new employees joined Veeva in Q2 bringing our total headcount to 2,827, up from 2,376 one year ago. Moving to the balance sheet, deferred revenue was $329 million, compared to $364 million at the end of Q1. This resulted in calculated billings for the quarter of $234 million, which was ahead of our guidance of $220 million. This was a function of a strong bookings quarter, outperformance in services revenue, and better than expected billing duration for the new business closed in Q2. Please remember that there are numerous factors that make year-over-year comparisons of this metric highly variable on a quarterly basis. Therefore, we do not believe it is a good indicator of the underlying momentum of our business and we do not manage to it internally. Our subscription revenue guidance and calculated billings guidance for the full fiscal year are the best indicators of our momentum. Looking ahead, we expect calculated billings of roughly $185 million in Q3, and roughly $1,135 million for the full year, which is a $15 million increase from the high end of our guidance provided last quarter. Also on the balance sheet, we exited Q2 with over $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from over $1.3 billion at the end of Q1. This increase was driven by our performance in cash from operations, which came in at $100 million and included $17 million in excess tax benefits related to equity compensation.  For the full year, we now expect cash from operations to be $345 million to $350 million, excluding this excess tax benefit.  Let me conclude by sharing the outlook for Q3 and for fiscal 2020. Next quarter, we expect revenue between $274 million to $275 million, non-GAAP operating income of $103 million to $104 million and non-GAAP net income per share of $0.54 to $0.55 based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 159 million.  For the year, we expect revenue in a range of $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion. We expect subscription revenue to be in the range of $871 million to $874 million. And within that, we now anticipate Commercial Cloud subscription revenue growth between 13% to 14% and Vault subscription revenue growth of at least 40%.  For fiscal '20, we expect non-GAAP operating income of $401 million to $404 million, a margin of about 38%, roughly a 100 basis point increase from our previous guidance. Coming off of a record hiring quarter, we plan to continue investing for customer success and future growth with an aggressive hiring plan for the remainder of the year. We are now targeting non-GAAP net income per share for the year between $2.11 and $2.13, based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 159 million.  Before I wrap up, I'd like to share some additional thoughts on my retirement. As Peter mentioned, we've kicked off the search for my replacement, and I will be here through the full on-boarding. As I retire from an incredibly rewarding 30 years in technology, my 10 years at Veeva have been the most fulfilling of my career. It has been a privilege to be part of such a talented team and a truly great company. The impact Veeva is having on our customers and the industry is remarkable.  This is evident in our quarter's results and our outlook for the back half of the year. The opportunity ahead, along with the team's focus and consistent execution sets us up for a trajectory of long-term growth. As always, thank you for joining the call.  And I will now turn it back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is actually Dylan Becker [ph] on for Bhavan. I guess I just kind of wanted to start off around Nitro and Andi adoption. What are you guys necessarily hearing from customers? And how has the implementation process gone? It looks like you're now projecting cloud growth of 13% to 14% for the year. How much of this is kind of attributable to the Nitro and Andi adoption?\nPaul Shawah: Hey Dylan, this is Paul, thanks for the question. So, with regards to Nitro, we added some additional customers this quarter. Last quarter, we talked a lot about some of the early customers that we had who were on stage at our big summit event, and they were talking about their implementation. Now they've been live for a period of time, and that's going extremely well. So, the product is certainly working in the early market.  I would say we're feeling a little bit of headwind from some of the anti-competitive behavior from IQVIA. So, some of the same behavior that they\u2019ve demonstrated with network, they're also demonstrating with Nitro. So, we have to balance some of the success that we're seeing with these early adopters with some of the headwind that we're seeing as well.  I would say with Andi, we're focused on getting the product to the right level of maturity and also getting some of those early customers kind of signed up and live. This is still early market -- early days really for both Nitro and for Andi. So, from a contribution standpoint, it's going to take some time before their material and meaningful impact from a contribution perspective.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then, I guess, kind of just, in general, as you look at the geopolitical environment around drug pricing and regulation, can you kind of remind us, does this have any effect around you guys just go-to-market here? And then are you seeing -- I mean what are you seeing and hearing from customers around this as well? Thank you.\nPaul Shawah: Yes, thanks for the follow up. So, it certainly has the potential to have an impact on how we go to market. And also, more importantly, the types of relationships that pharma companies have with their suppliers. We haven't seen any of that yet. Drug pricing is -- has the potential to have a very significant impact across the industry. It would affect all suppliers, Veeva being some of the -- in that same grouping. What I would say is, we haven't seen any impact yet. I'd also say that, as they have more pricing pressure and as they have more cost pressure, the balancing side of that that may create a tailwind is the fact that companies often look to technology to try to drive efficiency. So, I think there's a little bit of a potential headwind, but there's also some opportunity for technology to drive efficiency and cost savings as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills: Just one on CDMS. Obviously, you're seeing traction there in the top 20 segment of the market. I know you've been working on features as you're kind of moving up with reference building there. Are there any features in particular, you'd point to, to say, well, now CDMS is ready for these top 20s and maybe we're hitting a tipping point?\nPeter Gassner: Good question, Brad. This is Peter. In terms of features, you can always add more features, that's for sure. Software is never done. But we're pretty well feature-complete now I would say. Of course, features need to be rounded out over the years. So, what people would look for now is just proven success and some are going to want to be more early adopters than others. So, I think we're in the normal technology adoption lifecycle and this is a critical area for life sciences. So, it's not something that they're going to switch out easily, right, or without thought.  So, we're doing well on features. And in fact, in some cases, we're really getting out ahead of things, because we're taking a fresh approach, and since you asked about a product, I'm going to give you a detailed product answer because I like that stuff.  When clinical data management started many years ago -- electronic clinical data management started, it was about collecting data points of the patient. Now as medicines and therapies have become more complex, it's becoming more important to collect qualitative medical assessments from physicians, from third-party physicians who are assessing the data points. That's been an afterthought in medical device, in CDMS systems for many years, and because there is no innovation in the market, that just persisted.  Now, when Veeva comes out, we actually put excellent features in for that. And so, in some cases, in some feature areas, we're actually taking a fresh approach and leapfrogging the market, and this medical assessment is one of those areas.\nBrad Sills: And then one more if I may please. Just on commercial, you obviously raised the outlook for this year. Where would you point to in particular on the outperformance? It sounds like you've got a new customer win there but also you're executing well on some of these add-on attaches more company-wide. Any color you can provide on that, please? Thank you. \nPaul Shawah: Yes, hi, this is Paul, I'll take that one. So, the outperformance in commercial is driven by a couple of factors. First, CRM. We're seeing our enterprise customers expand into their regions faster than expected. So, that expansion is continuing to happen and we'll continue to see a bit more of that in the enterprise side. We're also seeing strength in small and medium sized companies. So, these big companies that are pre-commercial -- a lot of the net new wins here are pre-commercial companies and they're launching their first product. And what they want to do is they want to launch and have the most successful launch based on modern technology. So, we see a lot of success there. And the other trend that's happening there is they often go in with Veeva CRM and the number of the add-ons in the initial purchase. So, we see that, that is a bit of a trend that's continuing. So the -- some of the add-ons -- so CRM has strength, I would also point to a few of the add-ons that are kind of outperforming what we'd expected. So Engage is one area where a number of enterprise customers have begun global expansions on Engage. That will take time. That will happen over months, if not years. But we're seeing that trend continue, where they're able to demonstrate results and build out that business case. And we've also seen great performance, better than expected with Approved Email and also for OpenData. And I think what's driving that is, the industry trying to move to digital a bit faster as well. So we're seeing strength in both in CRM and the add-ons.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sandy Draper with SunTrust, your line is open. \nSandy Draper: I guess my question is going back to the hiring side. Tim, I think you commented you had maybe the most hires of any quarter, I think I may have heard that correctly. Just trying to get a sense of how -- what's driving that? And how much wage inflation is there? And are you competing against other players around the life sciences area? Or is it really more competing against tech people or a little bit of both? Just trying to get a sense of if you guys keep growing and selling along the top-line, how hard is it going to be to hire to support that demand? Thanks. \nTim Cabral: Yes, Sandy, this is Tim, thanks for the question. And Peter, I don't know if you want to add anything here on the hiring side we're seeing. I think a couple of things have contributed to what was a our strongest hiring quarter to-date. You identified that correctly, Sandy. Number one, we have a very strong university hiring program, we call Generation Veeva. And as you can imagine, typically, you'll see in Q2 and sometimes it spills a little bit into Q3, but mostly in Q2 is more hiring a lot of folks into that program, both on the engineering side and the consulting side. And that is then a focus of ours over the last couple of years as our thesis is, we really want to continue to grow industry cloud expertise. And we can do that from the university folks as they grow in the company here at Veeva.  Secondly -- and this may get to your wage inflation question as well, Sandy, where we've done a very nice job I think is we've opened up new hiring markets for us or focused more of our energy on newer hiring markets. So obviously Pleasanton in the Greater Bay Area is a very strong market for us and we continue to focus here. But we've also over the last couple of years really focused on Toronto and Columbus as other areas where we're finding both products people, some customer service people, and some back office people as well. So I think the expanding the number of markets we can hire from has also helped in our execution around hiring. Peter, I don't know if you had any additional color there.\nPeter Gassner : Yes. Tim summed it up well. It's about expanding locations, you have to do that. And then in terms of competition, it depends on the segment, whether it's fresh out of college, okay, that's tech companies and just helping companies in engineering, you're competing against tech companies in the field for general sales positions, you may compete against all tech companies, and then in some of our domain specific areas, like strategy. Yes, there we're competing against other life sciences specific companies. So it's always the same, right? You have to compete, if you have the best team, that's where you get the best company. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. \nKirk Materne: Peter, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the outside life sciences or the OLS business. Just in terms of referenceability and kind of where you are there. And what your thoughts might be around sort of upping the sales motion, if you are getting closer to referenceability? Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: Yes, we're happy with our progress outside life sciences, it\u2019s still early days. So our concentration really now is in some of these large customers we have rounding out the products. We are getting more referenceable over the time, and you won't see a hockey stick type of effect, but more of an even acceleration of the market and that's what we're seeing. \nKirk Materne: And Tim maybe just on your 606 comments. Is there anything left on that front in terms of sort of ramped deals that we should be thinking about I guess exiting this year and into next year? \nTim Cabral: Yes, Kirk, thanks for the question. In terms of 606 as you know we get a little bit of a revenue uptick, given the new revenue guidance around unbilled revenue of multi-year deals that have ramping fees and that are non-cancellable. So really, at the end of the day, it boils down to the mix of those types of deals. And there are a number of -- we're in the early days of Vault, which is where we see these. And so there is certainly an opportunity where those types of deals and/or the mix of those deals, either continues in a steady way or grows or contracts. It's not something we specifically forecast. And as I think, I said last quarter, I'll say it again here, as we see the actual impact of that being material to the results, as I've done in the last two quarters, I'll make sure I give that transparency and color. We think about it internally sort of like at [FX] in that way, when it's material companies like us will talk about it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Wong with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nKen Wong: So obviously, a couple of good CDMS wins these last two quarters. Peter, how do you see the recent acquisition of metadata impacting the CDMS market, you view that as a general kind of a tailwind or headwind for you guys?\nPeter Gassner: Well, the acquisition of metadata by itself has certainly caused a lot of questions about from customers, which is normal and some of those questions where they would ask -- customers would ask of us. And -- but we really haven't seen any change in the market. When we look at CDMS, it's really about building the best product, getting customers, getting them live and happy and successful and really innovating in the market.  So we have really seen no effect of the acquisition so far. How it will play out in the future? That's of course unknown. And that's not where we'll focus, but we're really focusing in on our customers now.\nKen Wong: Any sense if that might give you guys maybe a bigger window to reach out to customers? And there's I guess is sort of a change in terms of who they have to deal with now? Or has that also been fairly neutral at this stage?\nPeter Gassner: So it will cause a customer to consider, that's probably one thing they will consider as they're evaluating a system. But it's not something that we've seen materially affect any of our business or affect any type of competitive dynamics at this time.\nKen Wong: Yes got it. And if I can squeeze one in for Tim? Earlier you touched on duration helping billings. Can you talk about what's causing this? And should we expect this trend to continue?\nTim Cabral: Ken, thanks for the question. So that was of the billings beat, that was a smaller component of the billings beat, probably roughly half of the billings beat that we talked about was stronger bookings in the quarter. As it relates to duration, it really becomes a mix of the deal that we close in any particular quarter. And it can change based upon when the customers\u2019 renewal date is and depending upon the length of the add-on order. It could depend upon whether the customers that were closing in a particular quarter are more quarterly billers versus annual. So there's a lot of different factors which play in there Ken and it really depends on the mix as to whether or not that creates a little bit of uptick in billings.  Now you can imagine with the complexity there, we're likely on the conservative side as we think about forecasting for that particular component. But as I said, that was not the biggest part of the beat in the billings area.\nOperator: Your next question comes from James Rutherford with Stephens Inc. Your line is open. \nJames Rutherford: A couple from me. First, on artificial intelligence. We observed a rise in your innovation around AI. Of course you had Andi and then AI for PromoMats. And recently, you launched Safety.AI. So the question is, is it fair to say that you all will just apply AI to really every aspect of commercial involved and I guess OLS down the road as well. And the second part of that question is, is AI kind of a meaningful TAM expander or these are just mostly feature additions that you'll kind of continue to use to differentiate the product, so a little help on the context for AI?\nPeter Gassner: Okay James. AI, it's a long term trend. I remember when I was getting my computer science degree in the late 80s, in the early days of AI, and it's continued and it's getting more useful and impressive as they go on.  Now, in terms of Veeva, you will see AI applications from us, different applications that we can make now because the AI capabilities are there that we couldn't make before. So you mentioned Safety.Ai and Andi, those are fundamentally AI applications, brand new AI, brand new applications for us. And then we'll add AI into many areas of our existing applications to the automatic claims linking in the PromoMats, the Approved Notes for recognizing text sentiment in CRM. So it will -- what increases our TAM is when we make more applications, AI over the years is going to allow us to make more applications. That's probably the best way to think about it. And it's going to be a gradual expansion. AI grows over the years, the capabilities, it's not a not an on and off switch. \nJames Rutherford: And then Paul, one for you, if I may. We took note of the MuleSoft partnership announced recently. I'm just curious if you can help us understand how that fits with your Nitro strategy, MuleSoft, obviously, being a leader in iPads and API Management? So I think Mule is just kind of a way to grease the skids and help life science companies get that data into Nitro more quickly and easily? Just some thoughts around how that fits from a technology perspective? Thank you. \nPaul Shawah: Yes. So we actually think about MuleSoft a little bit differently and the focus for the announcement that we had with Salesforce around MuleSoft was focused on our Vault applications. So there's different mechanisms on getting Nitro data into Nitro, think of that separately. As our customers are expanding their Vault footprint and getting more and more Vault applications and really kind of these mission critical areas, the number of applications or systems that they need to integrate to becomes higher and higher. So when we look at -- when we think of the MuleSoft connector as a way to make those integrations seamless -- more seamless, faster, easier and easier for customers to support and maintain over time. So think about MuleSoft more specifically as it relates to Vault applications, which is the kind of a focus of that, that integration today.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. \nRishi Jaluria: Tim, congrats on all your achievements in Veeva over the past 10 years. It's been a pleasure. I think you set a great standard for other SaaS company CFOs to follow. So on that I would love to hear, what are you looking for in your replacement to kind of ensure that it's going to be a very seamless transition from you to whoever takes over your seat?\nTim Cabral: Yes, Rishi first thanks for the kind words. I think as Peter and the Board and I look for the key attributes of a replacement, it's someone who, as I think I've tried to build is, can be a really good business partner to Peter, to the leaders within the company and can connect to the Board as well. Someone who has some level of domain expertise around SaaS would be very helpful as well, because as you talked about the pattern recognition of what are the key metrics and the thing that make sense to a SaaS business.  Again, it doesn't have to be someone who's been in SaaS for 20 years with some familiarity would be very helpful. I am more of a finance person, our Chief Accounting Officer, Michele is much more of an accountant. So maybe we fit a mold more like me where it's more of a finance background, as opposed an accounting background. But I wouldn't rule out either of those, but I think I would lean-in in that direction.  And then really, someone who has the level of passion that I think is required for this job and really wants to take on what I think is unbelievable opportunity at an unbelievably impactful company like Veeva. So I don't know if that was a resume in description, but there's some of my thoughts. \nRishi Jaluria: And then Peter one for you, if I'm not mistaken, I believe Tom Schwenger joins next month, would love to kind of hear your perspective on what do you expect or what we should hope for out of Tom's joining in maybe his first 90 days at Veeva especially given that the R&D summit is coming out in the next week and a half, two weeks? Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: Yes, Tom is joining next month, and he's quite accomplished veteran, brings a lot of customer relationships and just knowledge of operating at scale teams of thousands of people and revenues into the billions at Accenture.  So what Tom -- the area Tom will focus on for us is in the sales area as President and CEO, the field, excuse me, not only the sales, but the field area. The customer success, the sales, the services, the strategy area. Tom will be based on the East Coast as well, Philadelphia. So he will cover that region. And Tom will be one of the key members of the management team and partnering with me. Tom's strength, again, is in deep understanding of life sciences, execution at scale and executive relationships and team building. And that's what I expect Tom will do for us here.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Hynes with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. \nDavid Hynes: So I want to follow up on the CDMS line of questioning. As I think about purchase decision considerations say for a top 20, is there a competitive advantage to sticking with an incumbent where there may be a data history? Or is each trial such a unique entity that, in theory, it would be easier to cut over to a new vendor? \nPeter Gassner: Good question. Each trial is independent in its data. And the long-term repository of the data meaning where does the data go after the trial is finished? That's an independent system, that's not a normally collected -- connected. It's not normally the same as the clinical data management system. It's normally of a -- you can think of it more of a data repository or data warehouse that's separate.  So that's not an impediment. What is hard for people when they\u2019re considering switching is, your clinical data management system has to be integrated with the other systems. If you bring in a new clinical data management system, that's other integrations to write and other testing and validation to do, because for a while, for a considerable period of time, you'll be running multiple systems. So that's a [tax]. So that's why this type of change is not considered lightly. Did I answer your question?\nDavid Hynes: That makes perfect sense. And then maybe kind of a bigger picture question. As we think about product roadmap for Vault, maybe over a three-year period or so, should we expect new efforts to predominantly stay within life sciences? Or we're getting to the point where the suites pretty built out, so maybe we start to see more in new verticals? And I want to be clear, I'm not asking about sales execution opportunity. I know there's still a huge runway in life sciences, but more just kind of how the product evolves?\nPeter Gassner: Well, there's a history I think of -- honestly, what I believe is there's a history of underestimating the potential inside of life sciences. And I saw that in 2010. I saw that in 2015. And now as we approach 2020, I also see that. So I think a lot of our expansion can still come inside of life sciences. I think we're actually relatively early in the industry cloud for life sciences, as surprising as that would seem.  Now, some proof of that is in okay, look, the clinical data management area for us is brand new, the safety area is brand new. But there are more things that can be done in life sciences, especially as we accumulate more and more data about life sciences. So we will certainly -- we are doing well outside of life sciences, but I wouldn't underestimate inside of life sciences. And I would say, also, just in general, our core platform of Veeva Vault that's in its very early days. I know how these things play out. When you really invest in a platform, that's something actually that you monetize, we're talking over 20, 30 years. And Veeva you got to remember is only 12 years old, yes. But Vault is only eight years old. So it's still very early days. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Brent Bracelin with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. \nBrent Bracelin: Thank you, I guess one for Peter and one follow up for Tim if I could. Peter, it's clearly been an incredible first half for Veeva, milestone quarter here crossing over $1 billion run rate. I think there's few companies that they're able to do this with accelerating growth across two major product categories. So things are clearly humming right now.  My question is more about next year. As you look at the product pipeline, customer opportunity, what are you most excited about looking out in the next year given things seem to be going really well right now? But what are you most excited about next year? And then one quick follow for Tim.\nPeter Gassner: Next year, it's just -- there\u2019s a lot of excitement. We're bringing in new people to company at an amazing pace. I was just in Denver last Friday -- Thursday night, Friday and Saturday, with close to 250 what we call Generation Veeva people. These are people that are two years or less out of college. And they're in consulting and R&D and commercial and engineering in Pleasanton and Toronto.  I'm just excited about the workforce we're developing here. So that's on one spectrum. On the other spectrum, we're bringing in people like Tom Schwenger, and we're growing that middle area. So I'm -- that's overall what I'm excited about. I'm excited about close to 3,000 people, all with a common culture, and really learning how to hum together.  Now, if you get into the product area, I'm really excited about the clinical data management and safety. There's new areas that are just super right for innovation and very early. And I'm excited about resurgence in what we can do in commercial cloud and some innovation we can bring in there.  So I'm excited about every year. It's going to be a great one and it really piqued my interest like okay, yes, we got to get after that. I think it's going to be a great year. I'm not -- I don't have any financial guidance. Do I Tim? \nTim Cabral : No we cannot give financial guidance. \nPeter Gassner : But overall, it's, I'm really excited about the mojo of the company, and that's created by the people coming into the company and the common culture where people can work together and enjoy it at greater scale. It's a beautiful thing.\nBrent Bracelin: Absolutely. Tim, just, again, to extend my congratulations on the retirement here. Certainly well earned, a great run, and you will be missed. Just drilling down into the Commercial Cloud growth, I mean we're seeing here now the second quarter of accelerating growth there. What's driving the improving visibility, you guided up for the full year here a little bit on the growth profile there? Are these Engage and event management rollouts big enough to kind of drive a sustained improvement in growth there? Or should we think about these things as kind of a couple of quarter rollouts that kind of will then kind of roll off? Help me understand the improvement on a Commercial Cloud growth side? \nTim Cabral: Sure. And Brent, thanks for the question and thanks for the kind words. Yes, we're very pleased with what we're seeing in Commercial Cloud. I would say that the recent uptick in growth that we've seen in the first half of this year, which is you've seen it impact our guidance, is mainly due to particularly strong bookings in the last few quarters. And I would echo what Paul said earlier, in terms of where we're seeing the strength from a bookings perspective. It\u2019s in CRM enterprise expansions that are going faster than we had anticipated. It's in SMB wins that are better than we anticipated. And as Paul said, we are seeing some particular strength in some of the areas, some of the add-on areas Brent, I should say, namely, Engage which Peter talked about Approved Email, and OpenData. So I think that's where we're seeing particularly strong bookings in the last three quarters, which is really driving the uptick in revenue. And as you remember, we've always characterized this as a steady growth business over time, even given this performance. That view hasn't changed in our minds.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.\nKarl Keirstead: I've got two fairly prosaic numbers questions for Tim. So Tim, maybe I missed it but did you update the full year billings guide? I think on the last quarter of $1.12 billion. And if I recall, you suggested that 41% to 42% of billings might drop in the fourth quarter, just want to make sure I didn't miss that? \nTim Cabral: Yes, Karl, thanks for the questions. The updated billings guide for the year was $1.135 billion, so an increase of $15 million over last quarter. And that -- we saw that in part being driven by the outperformance in Q2. \nKarl Keirstead: Got it. Okay, thanks for that, sorry I missed that. And then the second question was on your operating cash flow guidance Tim, which was for the full year ex the tax benefits a little bit above our estimate. And I calculate first half operating cash flow growth of a super strong 40% in the first half, so congrats on that performance. And I'm just wondering what it's from, is it just a function of the operating margin outperformance flowing into the operating cash flow line? Or is there a little something extra? Thank you. \nTim Cabral: Yes, so if you exclude the excess tax benefit, Karl, then you have the answer correct. It's really the operating income performance, which as you've seen is growing at a faster clip than our top-line revenue and that's contributing to the cash flow. And I guess I would be remiss for not calling out my team as well who have done a phenomenal job with the help of the field team. And certainly the help of the customer success that we've driven over time to really have another strong collections quarter and really have an amazing collections first half. So -- but you're right, it's being really driven off the operating income. And when you add in the excess tax benefit, that is even a higher growth in terms of operating cash flow year-over-year than operating income.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Merwin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nChris Merwin: Just as it relates to quality. One, I was wondering, if there's any update to the revenue run rate there? And then maybe on a product level, can you just talk a bit more about the traction you're seeing with the newer claims product? I think you might have mentioned some strength in CMG. But just curious what types of customers are taking that product so far? Thanks. \nPeter Gassner: In terms of the claims product, we have our early adopters there, that product is very, very early. And they're all in the consumer packaged goods, which is where claims is generally going to be targeted and scoring well, but early with that. We're implementing with the first customers iterating the product.  In terms of revenue, we're happy with the progress outside of life sciences, but that's not something that we break out at this time. And we'll give you further updates as we have them.\nChris Merwin: And maybe just one follow-up on [eight-figure] customers. It sounded like last quarter that was going really well. Just curious, if there's any update there and just on track to reach that target 20 by the end of the fiscal year? \nTim Cabral: Yes, Chris, this is Tim. So I think you characterized it correctly. We are continuing to build deeper and larger relationships with our customers. And that's been a function of two things I think. One -- well three probably, one our customer success, the innovation of our products and the expanding product portfolio, which gives us the opportunity to make a larger impact or create a larger impact for our customers. We typically have updated that number in our Analyst Day.  So why don't I hold off and we'll probably give you an update on the -- on that on the Analyst Day. You remember that that was part of the recipe to get to 1 billion revenue run rate, which we did eclipse this quarter. And Peter mentioned that in his quote, and we're very proud and excited about that milestone and the team has done a phenomenal job of executing over the last five years or four years since we gave that target.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tom Roderick with Stifel. Your line is open.\nParker Lane : It\u2019s actually Parker Lane in for Tom, thanks for taking my question. So one area we haven't heard much about involved recently is PromoMats. So I just wondering if you can talk about what remaining runway you see in your existing customer base for PromoMats adoption and any recent changes you made to that product that make it more appealing to the market? Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: PromoMats is going very well. It\u2019s certainly the leader in its market segment. We're happy with the uptake. We still have some Zinc migrations to go, Zinc -- we still have some Zinc customers and that will be supported until the end of next year, until the end of 2020. So there are some migrations in cycle and usually when that happens, there's some growth in that, because PromoMats has some capabilities that that are not there in Zinc. So it tends to be extended usage. We continue to add customers, especially in the SMB market, as new customers look to commercialize. That happens.  And one of the things we -- I guess there's two things we're quite excited about. One is the auto claims linking. So that I think is going to be a real boost for our customers. That's not a new revenue opportunity for Veeva, but that's really a customer success opportunity for the customers in the industry. And on the related area in what we call the commercial Vault is the MedComms application. We're seeing good for medical inquiries and managing medical content. So we're seeing good uptake there and we've recently added quite a few features there that we can think can expand that usage. So we're really happy about how PromoMats is doing and overall how the Zinc acquisition worked out. It worked out very well for us and our customers. \nParker Lane : Got it. And then multiple people have referenced the strength of Engage this quarter. Just wondering if that's a factor of increased demand from the market? Or have there been specific features that have finally come out that people have been looking for and been more receptive to really spur that growth and double the customer account over the last year? \nPaul Shawah: Yes, I'll take that one on Engage. So I would saying it's really two things. So one is, this is a different way of going to market. It\u2019s a -- think of an industry that's been so focused on meeting in person, and now you give them the ability to do something remotely. So there's been a lot of change management. So I think what we're seeing here is, over the last couple of years, a lot of customers trying and learning and figuring out how it works and how customers are going to respond and what works well, and what some of those best practices are. And they have since learned enough to build that business case, and increase the demand. So we're seeing demand from different markets across the globe who are -- who want to drive the adoption of that.  So I think there's a learning and change management component. I think that's largely that's happening. And that's happening relatively quickly. It's just a natural part of the life cycle of a new product like this. And I would say the other thing that's driving it is just the shift in our customer mindset to get to digital faster, to evolve to put in place the infrastructure to support their selling models of the future. All of our customers are in some respect talking about how -- what their future selling models are going to look like and digital is becoming a bigger and bigger piece of that. And what we're trying to do is make sure that we enable a lot of that shift in the market with a lot of innovation. So, Engage is one of the products that's driving that. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for questions-and-answers. Our final question will come from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Your line is open? \nJoey Marincek: This is Joey on for Pat, congrats on the quarter. And thank you for taking our question. Just going off to product questions. We're wondering about any new product initiatives you may have in the pipeline, particularly regarding Vault? Thank you. \nPeter Gassner: In terms of new product initiatives, well there\u2019s lots of things. There\u2019s adding on to existing products, and that's going all the time. You got to refine them, adding new features and functions, keeping up with the regulations. So that\u2019s -- and you\u2019re doing integrations between our suite, so that's a bulk of things going on. In terms of brand new products, we always have ideas about that and always thinking about that, but nothing we could announce at this time. \nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Peter for closing remarks.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you operator. I would like to thank everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to seeing many of you at our Analysts Day in San Francisco on October 2nd. And special thanks to the Veeva team for your effort and teamwork and to customers for their trust and support. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tim Cabral",
            "content": "Thanks Peter. Q2 was another quarter of solid execution across the board. Total revenue was $267 million up from $210 million one year ago, a 27% increase. Momentum across Vault continues with Vault now representing 52% of total revenue, up from 46% in Q2 of last year. Subscription revenue grew 28% to $217 million from $170 million last year. Vault represented 48% of subscription revenue, up from 42% a year ago. Year-over-year growth benefited from particularly strong bookings in the first half of the year, and from 190 basis points of tailwind from 606, due to the recognition of unbilled revenue from multi-year orders with ramping fees. Services revenue was nearly $50 million, up 24% from $40 million one year ago. We expect services revenue to be roughly flat sequentially in Q3. We continue to see strong profitability in Q2. Non-GAAP operating income came in about $104 million, a 39% operating margin above the high end of our guidance. This was primarily driven by outperformance on the topline. We made good progress investing in the business with a record hiring quarter. Approximately 180 net new employees joined Veeva in Q2 bringing our total headcount to 2,827, up from 2,376 one year ago. Moving to the balance sheet, deferred revenue was $329 million, compared to $364 million at the end of Q1. This resulted in calculated billings for the quarter of $234 million, which was ahead of our guidance of $220 million. This was a function of a strong bookings quarter, outperformance in services revenue, and better than expected billing duration for the new business closed in Q2. Please remember that there are numerous factors that make year-over-year comparisons of this metric highly variable on a quarterly basis. Therefore, we do not believe it is a good indicator of the underlying momentum of our business and we do not manage to it internally. Our subscription revenue guidance and calculated billings guidance for the full fiscal year are the best indicators of our momentum. Looking ahead, we expect calculated billings of roughly $185 million in Q3, and roughly $1,135 million for the full year, which is a $15 million increase from the high end of our guidance provided last quarter. Also on the balance sheet, we exited Q2 with over $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from over $1.3 billion at the end of Q1. This increase was driven by our performance in cash from operations, which came in at $100 million and included $17 million in excess tax benefits related to equity compensation.  For the full year, we now expect cash from operations to be $345 million to $350 million, excluding this excess tax benefit.  Let me conclude by sharing the outlook for Q3 and for fiscal 2020. Next quarter, we expect revenue between $274 million to $275 million, non-GAAP operating income of $103 million to $104 million and non-GAAP net income per share of $0.54 to $0.55 based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 159 million.  For the year, we expect revenue in a range of $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion. We expect subscription revenue to be in the range of $871 million to $874 million. And within that, we now anticipate Commercial Cloud subscription revenue growth between 13% to 14% and Vault subscription revenue growth of at least 40%.  For fiscal '20, we expect non-GAAP operating income of $401 million to $404 million, a margin of about 38%, roughly a 100 basis point increase from our previous guidance. Coming off of a record hiring quarter, we plan to continue investing for customer success and future growth with an aggressive hiring plan for the remainder of the year. We are now targeting non-GAAP net income per share for the year between $2.11 and $2.13, based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 159 million.  Before I wrap up, I'd like to share some additional thoughts on my retirement. As Peter mentioned, we've kicked off the search for my replacement, and I will be here through the full on-boarding. As I retire from an incredibly rewarding 30 years in technology, my 10 years at Veeva have been the most fulfilling of my career. It has been a privilege to be part of such a talented team and a truly great company. The impact Veeva is having on our customers and the industry is remarkable.  This is evident in our quarter's results and our outlook for the back half of the year. The opportunity ahead, along with the team's focus and consistent execution sets us up for a trajectory of long-term growth. As always, thank you for joining the call.  And I will now turn it back to the operator for questions. Yes, Sandy, this is Tim, thanks for the question. And Peter, I don't know if you want to add anything here on the hiring side we're seeing. I think a couple of things have contributed to what was a our strongest hiring quarter to-date. You identified that correctly, Sandy. Number one, we have a very strong university hiring program, we call Generation Veeva. And as you can imagine, typically, you'll see in Q2 and sometimes it spills a little bit into Q3, but mostly in Q2 is more hiring a lot of folks into that program, both on the engineering side and the consulting side. And that is then a focus of ours over the last couple of years as our thesis is, we really want to continue to grow industry cloud expertise. And we can do that from the university folks as they grow in the company here at Veeva.  Secondly -- and this may get to your wage inflation question as well, Sandy, where we've done a very nice job I think is we've opened up new hiring markets for us or focused more of our energy on newer hiring markets. So obviously Pleasanton in the Greater Bay Area is a very strong market for us and we continue to focus here. But we've also over the last couple of years really focused on Toronto and Columbus as other areas where we're finding both products people, some customer service people, and some back office people as well. So I think the expanding the number of markets we can hire from has also helped in our execution around hiring. Peter, I don't know if you had any additional color there. Yes, Kirk, thanks for the question. In terms of 606 as you know we get a little bit of a revenue uptick, given the new revenue guidance around unbilled revenue of multi-year deals that have ramping fees and that are non-cancellable. So really, at the end of the day, it boils down to the mix of those types of deals. And there are a number of -- we're in the early days of Vault, which is where we see these. And so there is certainly an opportunity where those types of deals and/or the mix of those deals, either continues in a steady way or grows or contracts. It's not something we specifically forecast. And as I think, I said last quarter, I'll say it again here, as we see the actual impact of that being material to the results, as I've done in the last two quarters, I'll make sure I give that transparency and color. We think about it internally sort of like at [FX] in that way, when it's material companies like us will talk about it. Ken, thanks for the question. So that was of the billings beat, that was a smaller component of the billings beat, probably roughly half of the billings beat that we talked about was stronger bookings in the quarter. As it relates to duration, it really becomes a mix of the deal that we close in any particular quarter. And it can change based upon when the customers' renewal date is and depending upon the length of the add-on order. It could depend upon whether the customers that were closing in a particular quarter are more quarterly billers versus annual. So there's a lot of different factors which play in there Ken and it really depends on the mix as to whether or not that creates a little bit of uptick in billings.  Now you can imagine with the complexity there, we're likely on the conservative side as we think about forecasting for that particular component. But as I said, that was not the biggest part of the beat in the billings area. Yes, Rishi first thanks for the kind words. I think as Peter and the Board and I look for the key attributes of a replacement, it's someone who, as I think I've tried to build is, can be a really good business partner to Peter, to the leaders within the company and can connect to the Board as well. Someone who has some level of domain expertise around SaaS would be very helpful as well, because as you talked about the pattern recognition of what are the key metrics and the thing that make sense to a SaaS business.  Again, it doesn't have to be someone who's been in SaaS for 20 years with some familiarity would be very helpful. I am more of a finance person, our Chief Accounting Officer, Michele is much more of an accountant. So maybe we fit a mold more like me where it's more of a finance background, as opposed an accounting background. But I wouldn't rule out either of those, but I think I would lean-in in that direction.  And then really, someone who has the level of passion that I think is required for this job and really wants to take on what I think is unbelievable opportunity at an unbelievably impactful company like Veeva. So I don't know if that was a resume in description, but there's some of my thoughts. No we cannot give financial guidance. Sure. And Brent, thanks for the question and thanks for the kind words. Yes, we're very pleased with what we're seeing in Commercial Cloud. I would say that the recent uptick in growth that we've seen in the first half of this year, which is you've seen it impact our guidance, is mainly due to particularly strong bookings in the last few quarters. And I would echo what Paul said earlier, in terms of where we're seeing the strength from a bookings perspective. It's in CRM enterprise expansions that are going faster than we had anticipated. It's in SMB wins that are better than we anticipated. And as Paul said, we are seeing some particular strength in some of the areas, some of the add-on areas Brent, I should say, namely, Engage which Peter talked about Approved Email, and OpenData. So I think that's where we're seeing particularly strong bookings in the last three quarters, which is really driving the uptick in revenue. And as you remember, we've always characterized this as a steady growth business over time, even given this performance. That view hasn't changed in our minds. Yes, Karl, thanks for the questions. The updated billings guide for the year was $1.135 billion, so an increase of $15 million over last quarter. And that -- we saw that in part being driven by the outperformance in Q2. Yes, so if you exclude the excess tax benefit, Karl, then you have the answer correct. It's really the operating income performance, which as you've seen is growing at a faster clip than our top-line revenue and that's contributing to the cash flow. And I guess I would be remiss for not calling out my team as well who have done a phenomenal job with the help of the field team. And certainly the help of the customer success that we've driven over time to really have another strong collections quarter and really have an amazing collections first half. So -- but you're right, it's being really driven off the operating income. And when you add in the excess tax benefit, that is even a higher growth in terms of operating cash flow year-over-year than operating income. Yes, Chris, this is Tim. So I think you characterized it correctly. We are continuing to build deeper and larger relationships with our customers. And that's been a function of two things I think. One -- well three probably, one our customer success, the innovation of our products and the expanding product portfolio, which gives us the opportunity to make a larger impact or create a larger impact for our customers.

            "name": "Peter Gassner",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Q2 was another strong quarter with results above our guidance. Total revenue was $267 million, up 27% year-over-year. Subscription revenue grew 28% year-over-year and our non-GAAP operating margin was 39%. Veeva has now passed the $1 billion revenue run rate. This is a year and a half ahead of the target we first laid out in 2015. With customer success as our driving force, we were able to exceed our goals through exceptional focus and execution. Thank you and congratulations to the Veeva team.  Today, we also announced our CFO, Tim Cabral, is retiring next year after a 30-year career and 10 years at Veeva. A search for his replacement is underway and Tim is staying at Veeva through the hiring and on-boarding of our new CFO to ensure a smooth transition. I'd like to express our appreciation and thanks to Tim. He's an exceptional leader, having helped guide Veeva from a start-up to our current scale. He also built a strong team. Working with Tim at Veeva and at PeopleSoft before that has been a true partnership that I value deeply.  Now turning to the details of the quarter. Strong momentum in Commercial Cloud contributed to our outperformance in Q2. In core CRM, we continued to extend our leadership position with new SMB customers, and additional enterprise expansions. And customers continued to adopt more CRM add-ons. This happens on a product-by-product and region-by-region basis.  Let me give a couple of examples. Veeva CRM Engage had one of its strongest quarters as four top 20 pharmas expanded their use of Engage to new field teams. Customers are attracted by the deep functionality and multi-platform support of Engage and the very tight integration with CRM. We also had an important design win at the top 20 pharma for events management. This customer has been using core CRM globally for many years and recently decided to expand their Veeva relationship to include events management in more than 90 countries over time. They chose Veeva because we have a deep functionality and professional services capabilities needed for a global event management rollout. They will replace multiple customer systems and spreadsheets, leading to a more efficient and compliant global process. It's great to see this expanding relationship with the longstanding customer.  Turning to Vault, we continued to have great momentum. Vault now has nearly 650 customers, and as of Q2, represents more than 50% of total revenue. This is an exciting milestone. When we started Vault a number of years ago, the potential was clear to me. And as I look ahead, it's also clear that we're in the early days of Vault.  This quarter, a newly independent top 20 medical device company standardized on Vault across the organization, including clinical, quality, regulatory, and commercial. With the ability to start from a clean slate, they chose Vault because it's the only solution to provide best-in-class application suites on a single modern cloud platform. Our customer-success focus and commitment to the medical device industry was also key.  In clinical, they will use Veeva eTMF, CTMS, and CDMS. Let's focus in on CDMS. They chose Veeva's CDMS over their incumbent system for a few reasons. First, they were looking towards the future and long-term partnership, so they liked our pace of innovation. They've seen Veeva's CDMS evolve rapidly over the past 12 months and are excited about what's ahead. They also saw that Veeva's CDMS is well suited to running all their types of studies. It can handle the complex studies, but also it is practical to use to use for small studies that are built on short notice. And they also won clinical data management and clinical operations, all on a common platform to gain operational efficiency. We now have a top 20 pharma and a top 20 med device company as lighthouse customers for CDMS. These early adopter accounts are very important, and their success is a major focus for the team.  CTMS is also progressing well. We continue to win more deals and now have 50 customers signed in just two years since the product was released. That's amazing momentum in a highly complex area. Our progress here speaks to the significant need in the market for a modern CTMS solution. We believe Vault CTMS is poised to be the leading solution over time.  Drilling down into quality. We signed our tenth Top 20 pharma for Vault QualityDocs. Following their success with Vault PromoMats, eTMF and submissions, this customer selected QualityDocs as part of their move away from a legacy content management platform.  On the QMS side of quality, we ended the quarter with more than 100 customers. The need for modernization is driving the move to Veeva in this area, as is the benefit of having QMS integrated with QualityDocs and training on the Vault platform. This is another great example of the innovation we're bringing to an underserved market.  Finally, I'd like to give an update on our efforts outside of life sciences. I'm pleased with the progress we're making within our three focus industries: CPG, chemicals, and cosmetics. Since announcing the new Vault Claims product last quarter, we now have projects in place at three top CPG companies. We're also executing well in chemicals and cosmetics. Customer success drives our business in all industries. This quarter, we had major go-lives at a top 20 CPG, a top 20 cosmetics company, and two major go-lives in chemical. In closing, we had a great quarter. Our results reflect the customer trust we have gained through consistent innovation, focused execution, and our commitment to their success.  With that, I'll turn it over to Tim. Good question, Brad. This is Peter. In terms of features, you can always add more features, that's for sure. Software is never done. But we're pretty well feature-complete now I would say. Of course, features need to be rounded out over the years. So, what people would look for now is just proven success and some are going to want to be more early adopters than others. So, I think we're in the normal technology adoption lifecycle and this is a critical area for life sciences. So, it's not something that they're going to switch out easily, right, or without thought.  So, we're doing well on features. And in fact, in some cases, we're really getting out ahead of things, because we're taking a fresh approach, and since you asked about a product, I'm going to give you a detailed product answer because I like that stuff.  When clinical data management started many years ago -- electronic clinical data management started, it was about collecting data points of the patient. Now as medicines and therapies have become more complex, it's becoming more important to collect qualitative medical assessments from physicians, from third-party physicians who are assessing the data points. That's been an afterthought in medical device, in CDMS systems for many years, and because there is no innovation in the market, that just persisted.  Now, when Veeva comes out, we actually put excellent features in for that. And so, in some cases, in some feature areas, we're actually taking a fresh approach and leapfrogging the market, and this medical assessment is one of those areas. Yes. Tim summed it up well. It's about expanding locations, you have to do that. And then in terms of competition, it depends on the segment, whether it's fresh out of college, okay, that's tech companies and just helping companies in engineering, you're competing against tech companies in the field for general sales positions, you may compete against all tech companies, and then in some of our domain specific areas, like strategy. Yes, there we're competing against other life sciences specific companies. So it's always the same, right? You have to compete, if you have the best team, that's where you get the best company. Yes, we're happy with our progress outside life sciences, it's still early days. So our concentration really now is in some of these large customers we have rounding out the products. We are getting more referenceable over the time, and you won't see a hockey stick type of effect, but more of an even acceleration of the market and that's what we're seeing. Well, the acquisition of metadata by itself has certainly caused a lot of questions about from customers, which is normal and some of those questions where they would ask -- customers would ask of us. And -- but we really haven't seen any change in the market. When we look at CDMS, it's really about building the best product, getting customers, getting them live and happy and successful and really innovating in the market.  So we have really seen no effect of the acquisition so far. How it will play out in the future? That's of course unknown. And that's not where we'll focus, but we're really focusing in on our customers now. So it will cause a customer to consider, that's probably one thing they will consider as they're evaluating a system. But it's not something that we've seen materially affect any of our business or affect any type of competitive dynamics at this time. Okay James. AI, it's a long term trend. I remember when I was getting my computer science degree in the late 80s, in the early days of AI, and it's continued and it's getting more useful and impressive as they go on.  Now, in terms of Veeva, you will see AI applications from us, different applications that we can make now because the AI capabilities are there that we couldn't make before. So you mentioned Safety.Ai and Andi, those are fundamentally AI applications, brand new AI, brand new applications for us. And then we'll add AI into many areas of our existing applications to the automatic claims linking in the PromoMats, the Approved Notes for recognizing text sentiment in CRM. So it will -- what increases our TAM is when we make more applications, AI over the years is going to allow us to make more applications. That's probably the best way to think about it. And it's going to be a gradual expansion. AI grows over the years, the capabilities, it's not a not an on and off switch. Yes, Tom is joining next month, and he's quite accomplished veteran, brings a lot of customer relationships and just knowledge of operating at scale teams of thousands of people and revenues into the billions at Accenture.  So what Tom -- the area Tom will focus on for us is in the sales area as President and CEO, the field, excuse me, not only the sales, but the field area. The customer success, the sales, the services, the strategy area. Tom will be based on the East Coast as well, Philadelphia. So he will cover that region. And Tom will be one of the key members of the management team and partnering with me. Tom's strength, again, is in deep understanding of life sciences, execution at scale and executive relationships and team building. And that's what I expect Tom will do for us here. Good question. Each trial is independent in its data. And the long-term repository of the data meaning where does the data go after the trial is finished? That's an independent system, that's not a normally collected -- connected. It's not normally the same as the clinical data management system. It's normally of a -- you can think of it more of a data repository or data warehouse that's separate.  So that's not an impediment. What is hard for people when they're considering switching is, your clinical data management system has to be integrated with the other systems. If you bring in a new clinical data management system, that's other integrations to write and other testing and validation to do, because for a while, for a considerable period of time, you'll be running multiple systems. So that's a [tax]. So that's why this type of change is not considered lightly. Did I answer your question? Well, there's a history I think of -- honestly, what I believe is there's a history of underestimating the potential inside of life sciences. And I saw that in 2010. I saw that in 2015. And now as we approach 2020, I also see that. So I think a lot of our expansion can still come inside of life sciences. I think we're actually relatively early in the industry cloud for life sciences, as surprising as that would seem.  Now, some proof of that is in okay, look, the clinical data management area for us is brand new, the safety area is brand new. But there are more things that can be done in life sciences, especially as we accumulate more and more data about life sciences. So we will certainly -- we are doing well outside of life sciences, but I wouldn't underestimate inside of life sciences. And I would say, also, just in general, our core platform of Veeva Vault that's in its very early days. I know how these things play out. When you really invest in a platform, that's something actually that you monetize, we're talking over 20, 30 years. And Veeva you got to remember is only 12 years old, yes. But Vault is only eight years old. So it's still very early days. Next year, it's just -- there's a lot of excitement. We're bringing in new people to company at an amazing pace. I was just in Denver last Friday -- Thursday night, Friday and Saturday, with close to 250 what we call Generation Veeva people. These are people that are two years or less out of college. And they're in consulting and R&D and commercial and engineering in Pleasanton and Toronto.  I'm just excited about the workforce we're developing here. So that's on one spectrum. On the other spectrum, we're bringing in people like Tom Schwenger, and we're growing that middle area. So I'm -- that's overall what I'm excited about. I'm excited about close to 3,000 people, all with a common culture, and really learning how to hum together.  Now, if you get into the product area, I'm really excited about the clinical data management and safety. There's new areas that are just super right for innovation and very early. And I'm excited about resurgence in what we can do in commercial cloud and some innovation we can bring in there.  So I'm excited about every year. It's going to be a great one and it really piqued my interest like okay, yes, we got to get after that. I think it's going to be a great year. I'm not -- I don't have any financial guidance. Do I Tim? But overall, it's, I'm really excited about the mojo of the company, and that's created by the people coming into the company and the common culture where people can work together and enjoy it at greater scale. It's a beautiful thing. In terms of the claims product, we have our early adopters there, that product is very, very early. And they're all in the consumer packaged goods, which is where claims is generally going to be targeted and scoring well, but early with that. We're implementing with the first customers iterating the product.  In terms of revenue, we're happy with the progress outside of life sciences, but that's not something that we break out at this time. And we'll give you further updates as we have them. PromoMats is going very well. It's certainly the leader in its market segment. We're happy with the uptake. We still have some Zinc migrations to go, Zinc -- we still have some Zinc customers and that will be supported until the end of next year, until the end of 2020. So there are some migrations in cycle and usually when that happens, there's some growth in that, because PromoMats has some capabilities that that are not there in Zinc. So it tends to be extended usage. We continue to add customers, especially in the SMB market, as new customers look to commercialize. That happens.  And one of the things we -- I guess there's two things we're quite excited about. One is the auto claims linking. So that I think is going to be a real boost for our customers. That's not a new revenue opportunity for Veeva, but that's really a customer success opportunity for the customers in the industry. And on the related area in what we call the commercial Vault is the MedComms application. We're seeing good for medical inquiries and managing medical content. So we're seeing good uptake there and we've recently added quite a few features there that we can think can expand that usage. So we're really happy about how PromoMats is doing and overall how the Zinc acquisition worked out. It worked out very well for us and our customers. In terms of new product initiatives, well there's lots of things. There's adding on to existing products, and that's going all the time. You got to refine them, adding new features and functions, keeping up with the regulations. So that's -- and you're doing integrations between our suite, so that's a bulk of things going on. In terms of brand new products, we always have ideas about that and always thinking about that, but nothing we could announce at this time. Thank you operator. I would like to thank everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to seeing many of you at our Analysts Day in San Francisco on October 2nd. And special thanks to the Veeva team for your effort and teamwork and to customers for their trust and support. Thank you."

            "name": "Paul Shawah",
            "content": "Hey Dylan, this is Paul, thanks for the question. So, with regards to Nitro, we added some additional customers this quarter. Last quarter, we talked a lot about some of the early customers that we had who were on stage at our big summit event, and they were talking about their implementation. Now they've been live for a period of time, and that's going extremely well. So, the product is certainly working in the early market.  I would say we're feeling a little bit of headwind from some of the anti-competitive behavior from IQVIA. So, some of the same behavior that they've demonstrated with network, they're also demonstrating with Nitro. So, we have to balance some of the success that we're seeing with these early adopters with some of the headwind that we're seeing as well.  I would say with Andi, we're focused on getting the product to the right level of maturity and also getting some of those early customers kind of signed up and live. This is still early market -- early days really for both Nitro and for Andi. So, from a contribution standpoint, it's going to take some time before their material and meaningful impact from a contribution perspective. Yes, thanks for the follow up. So, it certainly has the potential to have an impact on how we go to market. And also, more importantly, the types of relationships that pharma companies have with their suppliers. We haven't seen any of that yet. Drug pricing is -- has the potential to have a very significant impact across the industry. It would affect all suppliers, Veeva being some of the -- in that same grouping. What I would say is, we haven't seen any impact yet. I'd also say that, as they have more pricing pressure and as they have more cost pressure, the balancing side of that that may create a tailwind is the fact that companies often look to technology to try to drive efficiency. So, I think there's a little bit of a potential headwind, but there's also some opportunity for technology to drive efficiency and cost savings as well. Yes, hi, this is Paul, I'll take that one. So, the outperformance in commercial is driven by a couple of factors. First, CRM. We're seeing our enterprise customers expand into their regions faster than expected. So, that expansion is continuing to happen and we'll continue to see a bit more of that in the enterprise side. We're also seeing strength in small and medium sized companies. So, these big companies that are pre-commercial -- a lot of the net new wins here are pre-commercial companies and they're launching their first product. And what they want to do is they want to launch and have the most successful launch based on modern technology. So, we see a lot of success there. And the other trend that's happening there is they often go in with Veeva CRM and the number of the add-ons in the initial purchase. So, we see that, that is a bit of a trend that's continuing. So the -- some of the add-ons -- so CRM has strength, I would also point to a few of the add-ons that are kind of outperforming what we'd expected. So Engage is one area where a number of enterprise customers have begun global expansions on Engage. That will take time. That will happen over months, if not years. But we're seeing that trend continue, where they're able to demonstrate results and build out that business case. And we've also seen great performance, better than expected with Approved Email and also for OpenData. And I think what's driving that is, the industry trying to move to digital a bit faster as well. So we're seeing strength in both in CRM and the add-ons. Yes. So we actually think about MuleSoft a little bit differently and the focus for the announcement that we had with Salesforce around MuleSoft was focused on our Vault applications. So there's different mechanisms on getting Nitro data into Nitro, think of that separately. As our customers are expanding their Vault footprint and getting more and more Vault applications and really kind of these mission critical areas, the number of applications or systems that they need to integrate to becomes higher and higher. So when we look at -- when we think of the MuleSoft connector as a way to make those integrations seamless -- more seamless, faster, easier and easier for customers to support and maintain over time. So think about MuleSoft more specifically as it relates to Vault applications, which is the kind of a focus of that, that integration today. Yes, I'll take that one on Engage. So I would saying it's really two things. So one is, this is a different way of going to market. It's a -- think of an industry that's been so focused on meeting in person, and now you give them the ability to do something remotely. So there's been a lot of change management. So I think what we're seeing here is, over the last couple of years, a lot of customers trying and learning and figuring out how it works and how customers are going to respond and what works well, and what some of those best practices are. And they have since learned enough to build that business case, and increase the demand. So we're seeing demand from different markets across the globe who are -- who want to drive the adoption of that.  So I think there's a learning and change management component. I think that's largely that's happening. And that's happening relatively quickly. It's just a natural part of the life cycle of a new product like this. And I would say the other thing that's driving it is just the shift in our customer mindset to get to digital faster, to evolve to put in place the infrastructure to support their selling models of the future. All of our customers are in some respect talking about how -- what their future selling models are going to look like and digital is becoming a bigger and bigger piece of that. And what we're trying to do is make sure that we enable a lot of that shift in the market with a lot of innovation. So, Engage is one of the products that's driving that."

With that, thank you for joining us and I will turn it over to Peter.\nPeter Gassner : Thank you, Rick. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report another great quarter with results ahead of our guidance. Total revenue for the quarter was $245 million, up 25% year-over-year. Subscription revenue grew 27% year-over-year and our non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. It was an outstanding start to the year. Congratulations to the Veeva team and thank you to our customers for your continued partnership. I'll share some Q1 highlights starting on the commercial side of the business where we had another excellent quarter. We continue to extend our market leadership in core CRM. We added many new Veeva CRM customers on the SMB side in both the US and Europe. Many of these customers also purchased Veeva OpenData at the same time. We also made good progress with global CRM rollouts in existing enterprise customers.  CRM add-ons also saw further adoption. Events management, Align, and Engage continued to do well. For example, a top 20 pharma added more than 700 Engage users in Europe after their success with initial pilots last year. We hosted our Commercial Summit a few weeks ago in Philadelphia. With more than 1,600 attendees, it was our biggest event to date and is the largest of its kind in the industry. The feeling and sense of community was great. It's one of the highlights of our year. We and our customers always get a lot of ideas and energy from Summit. The major Summit themes were customer success and the emerging use of AI in multiple areas of our commercial cloud. In CRM, for instance, we announced Veeva CRM Approved Notes, which will use AI to reduce the compliance risk of taking free text notes, providing field reps a better way to manage relationships with doctors. Approved Notes will be part of our core CRM subscription and is planned for release early next year. Customers are excited about Approved Notes and our continued investment and innovation in CRM overall. In Commercial, there is a strong desire to do more with AI and advanced analytics. At last year's Summit, we announced we would build our first AI application, Veeva Andi. Veeva Andi is an artificial intelligence application designed to provide customer insights and next best action recommendations right in Veeva CRM. I'm happy to announce that Andi is now available. We had a lot of great discussions about Andi at Summit and are developing a pipeline of early adopter candidates. Overall, it was another great Commercial Summit. Turning to Veeva Vault. In Q1, we added almost 50 new Vault customers, which was a quarterly record. We saw strength across each Vault application area, including early success with new products and continued momentum with more established products. We won our first top 20 enterprise deal for CDMS. This is a big milestone for the product and for Veeva. The customer was looking for a cloud EDC solution on a proven platform.  The existing enterprise EDC offerings are older systems and are not true cloud applications. The customer also liked some of the innovative ways our system handles data entry, data review, and protocol amendments, as well as our vision for comprehensive data cleaning and reporting with Data Workbench. The customer had trust in Veeva because our teams have delivered success for them in multiple areas over the past eight years, both in R&D and commercial. They completed some pilot studies with CDMS in the last nine months and that went well. So, last quarter, they decided to move forward with a multiyear enterprise deal for CDMS. This was a great win for Veeva. One of our top company priorities is to ensure the success of this project and to use it to drive innovation in CDMS. We also signed a multi-product deal with a top 20 pharma in Europe for Vault in the clinical and regulatory areas. This customer just went live with Vault QualityDocs for over 50,000 users around the world. After working with our product and services teams on the QualityDocs implementation, they decided to go forward with eTMF submissions and submissions archive. This is a great example of customer success leading the way to future business. We have also signed our first four early adopters for Vault Safety, our newest product line in development cloud. It's still early days for Safety and these were small deals with small companies, but I'm pleased with our overall progress. Product is maturing every day and we have a growing pipeline of early adopter candidates. Safety is a mission-critical application for life sciences. It's complex and will have many integration points with our other Vault applications, so having a modern solution on a single platform is a great thing for the industry. Turning to our business outside of life sciences where we are concentrating on consumer goods, chemicals, and cosmetics. We recently announced a new application, Vault Claims. Claims will help manage the product claims lifecycle, from creation to approval to marketing usage. When speaking with early QualityOne customers, we saw a real need for a claims management application. We have already started a Claims project at a new top 20 CPG customer and have early discussions underway with others. Progress with QualityOne continues as well, both expansions in existing customers and bringing on new customers. For example, this quarter, we closed an initial QualityOne deal with another major cosmetics company. While still early, we're finding that companies are responding to our product offerings in consumer goods, chemicals, and cosmetics. In closing, we had another great quarter. We executed well across all areas, focused on customer success and product excellence, and had exceptional traction in new markets.  With that, I'll turn it over to Tim to review our financial results in more detail.\nTim Cabral : Thanks, Peter. Q1 was another quarter of consistent execution across the company. Total revenue was nearly $245 million, up from over $195 million one year ago, a 25% increase. Vault represented nearly 50% of total revenue, up from 44% in Q1 of last year.  Subscription revenue grew 27% to $198 million, from $156 million last year. Outperformance in this metric was driven by a very strong bookings quarter, favorable linearity of those bookings, and a tailwind of a couple million dollars more from 606 as compared to Q1 of last year. Services revenue was almost $47 million, up 18% from roughly $40 million one year ago. Strength in services revenue continues to come primarily from R&D Vault projects. I expect Q2 services revenues to be roughly flat with Q1. Our non-GAAP operating income came in over $93 million, a 38% operating margin, which was above the high end of our guide. This was driven primarily by outperformance on the top line. Across the company, we added 92 people net in the quarter, finishing at 2,645, up from 2,243 one year ago. Turning to the balance sheet, deferred revenue was $364 million compared to $356 million at the end of Q4. Calculated billings for the first quarter came in at $247 million, which was ahead of our guidance of $235 million. This result was primarily driven by strong bookings and outperformance in services revenue. The year-over-year growth rate of calculated billings was 16% in the first quarter. When considering that growth rate, please remember that calculated billings in Q1 of last year included an $18 million renewal of a large customer that subsequently shifted its renewal date to Q4. Adjusting for this, year-over-year calculated billings growth for the quarter would have been 26%. Please remember that there are numerous factors that make year-over-year comparisons of this metric highly variable on a quarterly basis. Therefore, we do not believe it is a good indicator of the underlying momentum of our business and we do not manage to it internally. Our subscription revenue guidance and calculated billings guidance for the full fiscal year are the best indicators of our momentum. Looking ahead, we expect calculated billings of roughly $220 million in Q2 and a range of $1.115 billion to $1.120 billion for the full year, which is an increase from the $1.100 billion guidance provided last quarter. We continue to expect about 41% to 42% of our billings for the year to come in Q4.  Elsewhere on the balance sheet, we exited Q1 with over $1.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from almost $1.1 billion at the end of Q4. This increase was driven by our performance in cash from operations, which came in at $236 million and included $14 million in excess tax benefit related to equity compensation. For the full year, we now expect cash from operations to be $330 million to $335 million excluding this excess tax benefit. This is an increase from our previous expectations for slightly more than $320 million, excluding the excess tax benefit. Let me wrap up by sharing the rest of our outlook for next quarter and for fiscal 2020. For the second quarter, we expect revenue between $259 million and $260 million, non-GAAP operating income of $94 million to $95 million, and non-GAAP net income per share of $0.48 to $0.49 based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 158.5 million. For the year, we expect revenue in the range of $1.045 billion to $1.050 billion, representing a $20 million increase from our previous guidance. We expect subscription revenue to grow roughly 24%. And within that, we expect Commercial Cloud subscription revenue growth of at least 11%, and Vault subscription revenue growth of roughly 40%. For fiscal 2020, we anticipate non-GAAP operating income of $385 million to $390 million, a margin of about 37%. This is an increase in both dollars and margin from our previous guidance of $365 million to $370 million and a margin of almost 36%. As you consider this margin guidance, note that we have an aggressive hiring plan for the rest of the year and we are expecting increasing litigation fees as we move into the next phase of our cases. We are now targeting non-GAAP net income per share of between $2.01 and $2.03 based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 159 million. To conclude, it was a great start to the year. Our product teams continue to lead the industry forward with innovation and our field teams continue to deliver customer success. Given this consistent execution, we remain confident in our ability to deliver at least 20% subscription revenue growth through calendar 2020. As always, thank you for joining the call and I will now turn it back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Tom Roderick with Stifel. Your line is open.\nTom Roderick: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I wanted to ask the first question here just on the clinical side. It looks like a tremendous Vault quarter again. And pretty exciting to see CDMS get -- land your first top 20 enterprise deal. I was hoping you could talk about that a little bit more. Two parts to that question, first, of course, being sort of the competitive dynamics. As you went in there, I gather you've probably been with this customer for a while. Can you talk about what they were looking to sort of to fix or to change or what the competitive dynamics were that got you over the top on that product? And then, sort of secondarily, as you think about the opportunity set of the wallet share within CDMS, how did those deals compare at a top 20 compared to, say, CTMS? Are those larger as you get into CDMS enterprise-wide?\nPeter Gassner: Thanks, Tom. This is Peter. As far as the competitive landscape for the deal, we're certainly competitive. This is a longstanding customer of Veeva's that had one of the large enterprise players for CDMS and had that for many years. So, there was no formal RFP process, but there was certainly a selection process. And in terms of what they were looking for, the CDMS is really \u2013 it's a very critical process for pharmaceutical companies. They're trying to collect clinical data from these research sites. The faster and more accurate they can do it, the better chance they have of completing their clinical trials and completing them quickly. So, it's a really, really mission-critical application. And they just needed a true-cloud system that had better data collection and workflow. Just really a better system overall and a chance to be great. I think that's what they were looking for, is a chance to be great. So, it's competitive and we won. In terms of the size of the deal or you mentioned the wallet share, CTMS is a bigger, larger application than \u2013 sorry, CDMS is a bigger and larger application than CTMS. So, to give you an idea, this deal, it's a multi-year deal. It will roll out over time; and at the full rollout, it will be an eight-figure per year deal. So, it's certainly a significant application area for us. It's our largest single Vault application.\nTom Roderick: Fantastic. That's great. And maybe just a quick follow-on in thinking about that opportunity, I know that CTMS has worked really nicely in conjunction with eTMF, given that you have a lot of sort of similar decision makers. This seems to be a little bit of a separate category and you've worked hard to integrate the workflows. But from a resource standpoint, do you need separate independent sales reps and a different go-to-market strategy as you start to land these top 20s or does this go right in the existing bag of the same clinical sales rep that's been selling there already on the other products?\nPeter Gassner: Yeah. I'd say it's a combination of both. This is a different area, the clinical data management area, which is different than the clinical operations area where you will have CTMS and eTMF. So, it's certainly a different area of the pharmaceutical company. We need specialized product consultants and specialized salespeople, but they do work with the broader R&D sales team. So, it's a combination of specialization for certain people and then tying it together to the broader Veeva R&D Vision.\nTom Roderick: Wonderful. Congratulations on this deal. I'll jump back in the queue. Thank you, Peter.\nPeter Gassner: Thanks, Tom.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Wong with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nKenneth Wong: Hey. Thanks for taking my question, guys. I guess I wanted to focus also a bit on Vault. You guys raised the subscription outlook there to 40%. Just wondering kind of what's changed in that dynamic? Is it you guys called out faster growth of new customers. Also, it sounds like the Vault pipeline is getting some more mature. CDMS, you guys signed an enterprise customer. Just trying to figure out kind of what are the puts and takes that got you to the higher number.\nTim Cabral: Yeah. Ken, this is Tim. I think you sort of answered the question a bit. It is a combination of all those things. Certainly, Q1 represented a very strong start to the year for Vault. We are seeing strength across the board, across the entire development cloud. And the contributing products are the ones that we've seen contribute in the past, meaning eTMF had a great quarter, CTMS had a very good quarter, QualityDocs had a good quarter, and we also had a good quarter on Regulatory. So, across-the-board strength and a really strong start to the year enabled us not only to raise the Vault subscription revenue guidance roughly 40%, but the overall subscription revenue guidance to roughly 24%.\nKenneth Wong: Got it. Thanks, Tim. And then, maybe for Peter or Matt. The QualityOne opportunity that you guys have touched on for a while now, it feels like that you guys are focusing a little more aggressively on being a kind of Veeva 2.0 for a bunch of these verticals. Can you talk about whether or not you're going to have to accelerate some investments there? And now that you guys have broadened out the portfolio a little bit, does it make more sense now to be aggressive in those markets or is this still something further down the line?\nMatt Wallach: Hey, Ken. It's Matt. So, we're already being aggressive in these markets. We've aggressively added people on to the product teams. And we've just announced that first product specifically for those three market segments. And we've continued to add salespeople in the US and Europe. So, it feels like we're being aggressive already. Now, we also are reminding everyone \u2013 we're still learning a lot, right? So, this is not just another application that goes right in the bag of the life sciences rep and we just turn the crank. Not that those are easy, but there are more moving parts on these. And so, because we're going after multiple types of companies in multiple market segments, with multiple products and now a brand new product, there's still a lot for us to learn. But I would say, we are already being aggressive here in making sure that early customers are super successful and that we use that and start the reference selling.\nKenneth Wong: Perfect. Thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Your line is open.\nBhavan Suri: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And congrats. I just wanted to touch a little bit on the breakup of the Vault business and sort of how you guys think about growth there. So, if you think about Vault, obviously, growing really fast over the past few years and Vault customer count now almost double CRM customer count. Can you just touch, Peter/Tim, maybe both of you, on how you're thinking about the growth formula with Vault going forward between new customers and new adds and how they expand versus the existing customers and the cross-sell or expansion within that existing base? Thank you.\nMatt Wallach: Bhavan, this is Matt. I'll actually take that one. So, because we have so many of the large customers, top 50 pharma companies already, the vast majority of incremental revenue is going to come from existing customers. So, that's just going to be the dynamic for Veeva going forward. We have multiple \u2013 we had a target of 20 eight-figure customers hopefully by the end of 2020 and it looks like we're on track for that. Those are really significant relationships. And when an existing customer buys one more Vault, it's certainly good for Veeva, but it's great for the customer because there's so many advantages that they get from having another enterprise product on the same platform. They get IT benefits, they get administrative benefits, and they get tremendous business benefits of having a single source of truth. So, in terms of incremental revenue, it's always going to be a larger number from existing customers because we have so many. But the long tail of smaller customers is also important. Some of those customers are going to become big. Some of those customers, if they go with competitors could help competitors get large. So, those companies are important to us from every different angle. But the large revenue story is going to come from existing customers, and I think we'll see that over time.\nBhavan Suri: Got it. Got it. And one on Andi and AI in general, and maybe, Matt, this is for you. Maybe also Peter. When you think about AI, can that serve \u2013 or Andi specifically, a halo effect on the rest of the CRM suite, like whether it's Nitro or Align or a CRM add-on?  And then, a quick follow-up to that is, how do you think about like introducing a similar sort of AI engine on the Vault side, right? So, I've got X number of steps in a particular part of the submissions, regulatory, and we can optimize that, we can automate that. I guess, are you seeing an appetite on that side for AI or is that still early? So, first, just sort of what the halo effect of sort of getting Andi and AI working on the core CRM side, obviously with Nitro; and then, B, I guess, is there optionality and interest on the Vault side for that? Thank you.\nPaul Shawah: Hey, Bhavan. This is Paul. Thanks for the question. Yeah. So, on Andi\u2026\nBhavan Suri: Hey, Paul.\nPaul Shawah: Yeah. Good to speak. So, this is something we announced a year ago at our Summit. And then, at the time, we didn't have a product and we didn't have a team focused on it. And at this Summit this year, we actually demoed the product and showed a real life product to customers and there was tremendous interest. We had hundreds of customers attend sessions focused on Andi. So, there is a very significant halo effect because of the excitement around the product and the potential for what it can deliver. Andi is focused on delivering suggestions, next best actions to customers, which really we believe will have a significant impact on a potential to have sales uplift for our customers. So, there's a lot of excitement, there's a lot of potential for what Andi can deliver and we are focused on improving a lot of that out in our early adopter program which we're kicking off over the next couple of months. That's next for us. In terms of \u2013 the one other thing I'd say just beyond Andi is just around the concept of embedding AI into the application. So, at Summit, we had also two big announcements, one in the CRM space that Peter alluded to called Approved Notes, which is where we're using AI to drive better compliance as sales reps and they use free text in their comments. We'll use AI to drive better compliance around that \u2013 compliance and visibility to all the notes that they have in the system. That's super valuable to customers. That resonated extremely well. And then, also on the Vault side, as you mentioned, we're starting in Vault PromoMats with AI doing Auto Claim Linking. So, what that means is that you make a claim about a specific product, you have to link that back to the underlying reference material. So, we're already getting interest and excitement around Vault for AI and we're already making some strides in terms of embedding that in there, and I think you'll see more of that in the future.\nBhavan Suri: That's really cool. I might squeeze one more in. So, as you think about outside life sciences, obviously, AI [indiscernible] quality and quality process and quality management teams are interesting too, is that an area \u2013 are we talking two years down the road where that gets embedded in QualityOne and OLS or is that something near term?  Thank you. And thanks for taking my questions.\nPeter Gassner: In terms of outside of life sciences \u2013 this is Peter \u2013 we're still early there. So, we have a basic blocking and tackling to do our new claims product. What's going on outside of life sciences is we're learning a lot. We're developing deep customer relationships. And what we're finding is they have a need for a partner in the quality, regulatory, clinical and claims area of consumer packaged goods companies. What claim am I making about this new product? How fast can I get things, like the label, approved? When I change ingredients, how do I need to do my regulatory filings in the different countries? If I were to have a complaint on this product, how do I register that? If I need to change a process, how can I do that in a compliant way? So, that claims quality, legal/regulatory set of things is very highly related. And there is a need for that integrated in together all on the same platform. So, that's what we're focused on. AI will come outside of life sciences, but not in the immediate future.\nBhavan Suri: Got it. Thank you, guys. Thanks for my questions. And congrats.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sterling Auty with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nJackson Ader: Great, thanks. Hi, guys. It's Jackson Ader on for Sterling tonight. Question from our side, when we're talking about an enterprise-wide CDMS win, can you give us just a little bit more color on how CDMS is going to be rolled out to Veeva? Is it going to be all new trials and all new phases going forward? What does that actually look like?\nPeter Gassner: Yeah, I can take that one. Yeah, it has to be phased in because, in the clinical data management system, there's many people inside of the customer that work with many different groups from data management people to the statistical type people to the people that do the clinical monitoring. And there's also people in the research side that deal with these systems too. So, there will be a phased approach because you have to train people up and get them going on it. Yeah, at some point, it will be all clinical trials, all new ones started on Veeva. That may be all between 18 months or so from now or two years from now. That's how long it will take. Because, for example, in a therapeutic area where you have multiple related trials and you have some system of reuse going on on the existing system, you're going to be a little hesitant to break off the sort of add-on trial and put it on the new system. You're going to want to keep that with the family of other related trials. So, it's a nuanced thing, but certainly in the \u2013 two years from now, we would expect the bulk of the trials to be on our system.\nJackson Ader: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And then, can we just clarify, Peter, I think the comment you made about these types of deals for CDMS possibly being eight figures? Is that on an annual basis? Is that a total contract value? What kind of timeframe or subscription are we talking about?\nPeter Gassner: Yeah. That's on an annual basis at the terminal. When it's fully ramped up, the subscription fees \u2013 and that rolls out over several years, but not getting into the specifics of how many years. But that's \u2013 the figure I quoted there for eight figures was on an annual basis at the terminal run rate.\nJackson Ader: Got you. All right. Thank you. That's all from us.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham. Your line is open.\nScott Berg: Hi, everyone. Congrats on a great quarter. I have one and a follow-up here. I guess a kind of an extension to a couple of the outside life sciences questions. You're bringing claims there. Can Safety set outside of life sciences going forward? I would imagine that there are some similarities between those types of customer sets.\nPeter Gassner: Yes, it will. Safety will. Now, it will have a slightly different flavor to it because of the process is different and the regulatory bodies are different, drug safety versus consumer product safety. And that's something \u2013 for the safety products outside of life sciences, that is not for the immediate interest [ph]. We feel that Safety inside of life sciences, that's going to keep us really busy. And it's a mission-critical large applications. So, we're talking probably a couple years out for safety outside of life sciences.\nScott Berg: Great. And for my follow-up question, Tim, I was just kind of reviewing the model a little bit and probably nitpicking on a company that has 38% operating margins in the current quarter, but why are you not seeing any leverage around G&A? I kind of look at the spend there and it's been relatively flat as a percentage of revenue over the last three years. Thanks.\nTim Cabral: Yeah. Scott, I would say we are seeing leverage in G&A. But we're also, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, seeing increasing litigation fees for a couple of the lawsuits that we're working on and that is hiding the leverage we're seeing within G&A.\nScott Berg: Great. That's all I have. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stan Zlotsky with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nStan Zlotsky: Hey, gentlemen. Good afternoon. And, Matt, it's good to hear you on the call. I'm guessing this is going to be your last one. Maybe just a question for you in that case. Commercial Cloud, the newly planned acceleration to over 11% this year, I don't think many people are really expecting to see an acceleration here versus a year ago. If you were to rank the drivers of the continuing growth in Commercial Cloud, what would they be? Would it be adoption by new SMB customers, products like Events, Engage, any other add-ons?\nMatt Wallach: Hi, Stan. Yeah, this is Matt. Thanks for the call out. I'm actually going to let Paul answer the question now.\nPaul Shawah: Hey, Stan. How are you. This is Paul. I get to steal this one from Matt. So, yeah, really excellent quarter in Commercial, as you've heard. I wouldn't attribute the strength in Commercial to any one thing in particular. I'd actually \u2013 the strength is really from \u2013 broadly in CRM and across the add-ons in general. So, to be more specific, in CRM, we saw significant expansion from global customers, existing customers who were completing their global rollouts as they went and expanded into new markets. We also saw expansions from existing customers as they launch new drugs and they get approval and they build out a sales team. We've seen growth there as well. And also, on the SMB side, we continue to win the vast majority of those deals also. So, that's continuing to add to the strength. And that foundation for CRM that we're building is giving us really the right foundation to sell the additional add-ons to and we've seen that pull through in this quarter as well with really great traction from events. And then, some of the other add-ons that are building momentum like Engage, for example, which is newer, we had customers speak at our customer summit talking about how they're changing the selling model, how they're getting access to customers, to doctors, that they've never been able to get access to in face to face, they're now accessing them in a video call and they're getting more time on video than they would've face to face. So, we're starting to see that traction pull-through on the add-on side. So, I would say that strength is really CRM and the add-ons pretty consistently.\nStan Zlotsky: Got it. What I was trying to get at was the guidance for Commercial Cloud for the full year to accelerate to 11%. And I would presume your answer still applies going forward for the rest of the year, right, as far as the drivers?\nPaul Shawah: That is correct.\nStan Zlotsky: Got it.\nPaul Shawah: Yeah, those would be drivers [indiscernible]. Yeah, that's right.\nStan Zlotsky: Okay, got it. Great. And maybe a quick follow-up. How is the Nitro product doing? We heard in \u2013 on the Q4 call, there were six early adopters and you already had a couple live. How is that product doing despite like the competitively restrictive practices that we're out in the space?\nPeter Gassner: Yeah. So, Nitro is doing really well. And the quarter we had a couple of early customers go live. In fact, we had three customers speak at our customer summit. One was on the main stage and then two shared very detailed presentations about the benefits they're getting from Nitro, which is getting metrics out to the field, into their promo office faster, putting that foundation in for AI. So, our customers, the early adopters, are doing very well. We've also added some customers to Nitro also. That growth that we have there is really measured. We're focused on early adopters and customer success in the early market. We're unfortunately still seeing some of the anti-competitive behavior from IQVIA. So, that's creating some headwinds for us with Nitro. And we're hopeful that we're able to get that resolved over time. But, yeah, that has been an impact so far.\nStan Zlotsky: Perfect. And the last one maybe for Tim. Tim, the strong operating margin performance in the quarter, you mentioned it's largely revenue outperformance. Was there any kind of hiring linearity in the quarter? Because when we've seen operating margin outperformance to this degree, it usually coincided with hiring maybe being a little bit more heavily skewed to the back half of the quarter versus a little bit more linear throughout. And that's it from me. Thank you.\nTim Cabral: Yes. Stan, thanks for the question. We had a really good quarter from a hiring perspective. I think you're right. There was probably a little bit more back-end loaded linearity. But, overall, it was a very strong quarter. The one thing that I did say as it relates to the outperformance of revenue in my prepared remarks, especially on the subscription revenue line is, couple more million of 606 impact than we had seen last year. And, Stan, I think you probably know this, that is 100% margin. So, that drops right down to the bottom line with no cost of goods sold and no really operating expenses against it. So, I think that also benefited the operating margin performance. But I would say, lastly, that the operating margin of a little over 38% was fairly consistent with what we saw in the second half of last year in terms of what the operating model is starting to firm up and look like as we go forward.\nStan Zlotsky: Perfect. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from James Rutherford with Stephens. Your line is open.\nJames Rutherford: Hey, good afternoon. And thanks for taking the questions. A couple from me. First, I want to circle back on the CDMS win. Obviously, a very nice milestone. But the question is \u2013 perhaps it's too early, but I'm curious how you've seen customer conversations change since that deal was announced and whether it's starting to push things in your favor when you kind of go against your more legacy competitor in that space?\nPeter Gassner: Yeah. I think it was certainly noticed in the industry. Clinical data management is a tight community. They are kind of scientifically oriented, fact oriented, really interested in the patient outcomes and getting therapies out to patients, getting therapies approved. So, information flows fast. I would say faster in the scientific and clinical community. It flows faster than in the commercial communities. So, there's a lot of interest. We've seen an uptick in conversations. I think there is an uptick in customers' thinking, 'well, maybe that could be possible for me.' So, there is more interest, I think, in pilots by large customers. Now, whether that will turn into fruition or not, that's something that we'll see over the next 12 months. But, certainly, the interest is up. And I think a lot of eyes are on this project. How successful will it be? There's a lot of people wanting to know that.\nJames Rutherford: Okay, that's helpful. And then a follow-up for Tim, if I may. I think last we heard outside of life sciences was contributing, I think, over $10 million of revenues is what you had said. I'm curious if you can frame up where the ARR on that product stands today and how much it might contribute to fiscal 2020? Thank you.\nTim Cabral: Yeah, James. Thanks for the question. We haven't talked specifically this year about outside life sciences in terms of what the contribution is. What I would say qualitatively is what Peter and Matt said earlier, which is we're seeing really good early progress with our early adopter customers. The innovation that we're seeing from the product team, you heard in Peter's prepared remarks, that the momentum continues to be strong. We haven't specifically quantified what the size of that business is at this time now.\nJames Rutherford: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brent Bracelin with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nBrent Bracelin: Great. Good afternoon. And thanks for taking the question here. I had one question and one follow-up. The question I wanted to drill down again is something you've talked a lot about today, and that's on the demand side. But wanted to kind of help frame what's happening. Obviously, you're raising the full year guide by $20 million. Subscription growth accelerated to 27%, the highest in more than a year. Is this a byproduct of customers going all-in on Veeva that you talked about at the Analyst Day? Is this more of a financial mechanics of just Vault increasing as the mix grows to close to 50%? Do you have increasing confidence on both the Vault and Commercials parts of the business? As you think about kind of what surprised you most this quarter and given you the optimism here, what would you attribute it to?\nPeter Gassner: This is Peter. It's overall good execution. Good execution in our product, good execution in our field, that's number one. You can't take those things for granted, right? We used to have a saying, we say execution matters most. It's what you do every day, every week, every month, every quarter. A grand idea is just a grand idea. So, I think it's just consistent great effort by the Veeva team in partnership by our customers. That's the bulk of what's going on. Now, what that \u2013 I guess there's a couple other things. There's a backdrop involved. We now have 17 Vault applications and they are for very specific areas, diverse sets of areas. So, that does create a halo effect. Customers are starting to see, wow, I can \u2013 my internal operations can be much more efficient with Veeva. I can get a lot of applications, they're integrated together, and the projects are generally successful and I like working with the people. So, with 17 applications, now there's more bites at the apple with any particular customer. So, I think those are the two things going on. And then reputation. Reputation grows every year with continued success, as long as you continue to have success. So, the longer we have success, the reputation grows. We have more products and we are continuing \u2013 the Veeva team is continuing to hustle every day, go the extra mile for the customer. So, that's it. No real magic, but just great execution.\nBrent Bracelin: Thank you. That's helpful. And then, I guess, Tim, for you. Just as we think about the monetization opportunity around Nitro and Andi, we've certainly seen other SaaS companies kind of layer in and weave in AI functionality as part of the platform to differentiate. What is the monetization path for you as we think about Nitro and Andi add-ons? Are these going to be consumption based models tied to kind of usage? As more people use Nitro or Andi, you're going to get revenue tied to it. Walk us through the monetization opportunity around those two new products. Thanks.\nPaul Shawah: Yeah. Hey, Brent. So, this is Paul. You mentioned two things there. One was Nitro and the other was Andi. So, I'll take them separately. Nitro is the commercial data warehouse. And there's certainly a monetization concept around Nitro which will be driven by, basically, the size of the organization. We're using field users as a metric for that. And that's a significant opportunity and we've talked about being roughly the size of CRM. That's a foundation for AI. It's not necessarily the AI capability. It's what AI is driven from. Andi is the application engine, and that does a very specific thing. That drives insights and it drives suggestions directly to the field. People in industry typically talk about that as next best action and we'll also monetize that as well. And that's on a per user, per month basis for our customers. And then, you also heard Peter in his prepared remarks talk about some of the AI that we're building into the application. And some of those components are just about really driving efficiency, making the application more smart \u2013 kind of smarter or more compliant, and some of those are differentiating and just value-adds that just are part of the existing license. So, what Peter talked about as Approved Notes, that's part of the Veeva CRM core license. And what we talked about is Auto Claim Linking, that's part of the Vault PromoMats license. So, you see a little bit of a mix of both where some are kind of very specific products and then others are embedded into the application.\nBrent Bracelin: Helpful color. And thanks a lot.\nPeter Gassner: Yeah, I would just add on to that broadly speaking. Some AI is going to be added into the existing subscriptions. Some are going to be brand new AI applications that are a subscription on their own. And I wouldn't be surprised if we have transaction-oriented AI pricing in the future where it fits. So, Veeva \u2013 the thing to remember is Veeva will run to the complexity. We will really find the application that really, really fits for an area. And part of that is finding the pricing model that fits for that area, and that's going to depend on the use case just as it does in a transaction-oriented system, it can depend on the use case, and in the AI-oriented systems.\nBrent Bracelin: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Peterson with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nBrian Peterson: Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. So, just on the record Vault wins, I'm just curious how much of that is a function of having the 17 Vault applications that you referenced? Or is there anything that we can actually read into in terms of deal close rates or anything with sales velocity that's accelerating that as well?\nMatt Wallach: This is Matt. It's a good question, Brian. So, that was the number of new logos. So, companies that bought their very first Vault. And so, that is \u2013 it's going to be because of success of those Vaults that they bought at other customers. So, is it because there's so many Vaults? I guess, yeah. That would contribute to it that there's going to be more opportunities, more shots on goal per se. But I think that what is driving faster adoption by new companies is that these companies are all in the same industry. The overarching objective of people that work in the life sciences industry is to help patients. And so, what we find \u2013 and the reason why I referenced selling is so intense is because, if they can help another company help patients, they'll do it. So, our happy customers are pretty eager to talk to prospects about their use of Vault. And because their use has been so positive across so many of these applications, we're getting a lot of opportunity to introduce Vault to new companies.\nBrian Peterson: Got it. Thanks, Matt. And, Tim, maybe one for you just on Vault. Given the success that you're having across the product portfolio, I'm curious, how should we be thinking about service capacity investments and any impact on margins going forward? Thanks, guys.\nTim Cabral: Yeah. So, Brian, on the services side of Vault, we have a really strong team there, a lot of good domain expertise in that team. And as you've seen us grow the Vault business over time, obviously, a lot of pattern recognition on best practices that a company like Veeva can be a cross-pollinator or a pollinator of best practices across the industry. So, that's happening. In terms of the capacity model, we continue to not only build talent through our Generation Veeva, which is our college recruiting engine which has gone fabulously well over the years, certainly in the last couple of years. We've accelerated that. As well as finding great people in the industry. So, we're not necessarily capacity constrained. And one other thing I would add to that, Brian, is, over time, like you saw in Commercial Cloud, we've built quite a nice ecosystem of partners in the US and Europe, primarily, and starting to some early stages in Asia. So, from a capacity perspective, we're in good shape given those dynamics.\nBrian Peterson: Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nRishi Jaluria: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start on Veeva Claims. It looks to be a brand new products versus QualityOne where you're taking existing solutions in QMS and QualityDocs and kind of repackaging them into something new. Should we expect this idea of purpose-built OLS products to be a new normal? And then, alongside that, is there a potential for a little bit of a margin hit since you're actually investing dollars in product development versus retooling existing solutions? And then, I've got a follow-up.\nPeter Gassner: Yeah. It is the right way to think about it, that claims is the brand new application. It's in a separate Vault from the QualityOne Vault. It's a standalone. And the reason for that is, it's a very specific use case, has a different set of users and it rolls out in a different way.  So, for example, our first customer from four claims was a top 20 CPG customer. Now, it turns out this is the first application that they bought from Veeva because they had a very specific need in their own claims and it needs to roll-out on its own way. Now, that customer, and we believe, will buy other products from Veeva over time. So, now in terms of the margin hit, the other applications QualityOne and the regulatory, they need effort and specific features for outside of life sciences. So, I would see no really difference in the margin hit. This will be small things that you won't be able to see in terms of overall costs. You have to remember that we are getting a lot of leverage from the Vault platform. That is, if you look at the maturity of the Vault platform now versus even two years ago, it's pretty striking. Like, that's the \u2013 if you look at the iceberg where most of the effort is under the covers, most of the effort in our product area is actually under the covers in our Vault platform. You see the application sales, but the leverage and the operating model and the power of the sales is actually a lot of it coming through the Vault platform where we've made tremendous strides really over the last two, three years.\nRishi Jaluria: Got it. That's helpful. And then, just as a follow-up, I wanted to maybe take a step back. So, in 2015, sort of four years ago, you put out this $1 billion target or $1 billion run rate target for calendar year 2020. Clearly, you've overachieved that. And if we go by your guidance, you're going to hit that $1 billion run rate next quarter. So, about a year-and-a-half or so ahead of schedule with significantly higher margins. If you were to take a look back, where was it or what particular areas was it that you're able to kind of hit that goal significantly ahead of schedule and with higher margins? Was it things like Vault taking off as you had expected? Was it a larger kind of set of solutions that you were able to go after? Or anything else, that would be helpful. Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: Yeah. That's a great question, right. As we think back to 2015, quite some time ago now and we had the plan, so the basic question is what went better than expected. I would say, the number one thing is that nothing bad happened, right? And when you're making that long range of a plan, you have to assume that there will be some unexpected bad news along the way, right? Nothing bad happened. I guess, since 2015, we've roughly doubled the size of the company, close to or so. And we've retained our energy. And, in fact, got some acceleration, I think. We've actually gotten more efficient as we've got larger. More efficient in our selling \u2013 I don't think we anticipated that we would get more efficient as we grew larger. So, that's happened well. I think those are really the things. Outstanding execution, good decisions on process, and no unexpected bad news, and so we got there. And I would say, along the way, we probably had some key things that just happened to break our way and that accelerated us.\nRishi Jaluria: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne: Hi, guys. Thanks very much. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the quarter. Given that you guys are just coming off Summit, I was actually curious, just based on some of Matt's earlier comments, if there are a number of Vaults that a customer \u2013 after a customer buys that the discussions sort of tips more to a discussion almost more about the platform, meaning are we at the point now where companies are bidding on your platform as much as they are bidding just on some \u2013 and they, obviously, expect probably get products to go along with that. But I'm just kind of curious [Technical Difficulty] talking about the benefits from just having everything on an integrated platform as they are about the specific product features for each of the specific [Technical Difficulty]. Would that be too early for that? But I'm kind of curious if you compare it to, say, this year and last year, if things are heading in that direction. Sounds like [indiscernible], but just curious on your thoughts maybe?\nMatt Wallach: Yeah. I don't think it's too early to think that way. When we first invented Vault, I remember the very first PowerPoint slide we put together was Vault as an enterprise platform. So, the idea was that companies would make that part of the electricity that runs the company. And we thought it could take four, five, six years before we got there. And we did get there faster than I think we expected at that time. The way you asked your question is interesting. I think that, when you buy the first application, you're probably not thinking this is my platform across the board. When you buy the second application and see the benefits of having two major systems of record on the same platform, which has never been possible before across clinical, regulatory, quality, medical, and commercial, I think when you get the second one is when the discussion at least starts internally as, like, hey, we've got great benefit from the second one, what if we got them all. And so, we don't have a formula here. And I think a lot of companies are different. But I don't think that the first successful project necessarily is the entr\u00e9e to an enterprise-wide deployment. But I do think the second successful one is a good way to think. And so, as a specific example, we talked in the prepared remarks about one company just went live with all of their employees, 50,000 employees around the world with QualityDocs, that was actually their second Vault. They also had PromoMats. And then, their decision to expand to the submissions archive, submissions, and eTMF is basically making it an enterprise platform. So, I hadn't planned it this way, but that specific example does support the answer there.\nKirk Materne: Okay, that's helpful. And then, maybe just one last one on OLS. You had mentioned that outside has always been important [indiscernible] key to your success. When you get into OLS, is there certain size and scale in terms of the number of customers or in the ARR where it's time to sort of turn on the gas even more from just a distribution and a sales perspective, meaning making sure that you're covering a bigger portion of the US or the amount of targets that you might have out there in the specific industries? Are we a year away from that or are we there? I'm just kind of curious about [indiscernible] you have success with the customers and your customer success translates into more selling opportunities. Where are we on sort of like \u2013 now it's time for us to start focus on adding distribution capabilities or just distribution coverage more broadly versus just having to focus on making sure these guys are really successful from a customer perspective?\nPeter Gassner: Yeah. I would say we're early days. We're really focused more on the customer success. We just introduced this claims application, for example. We have some customers using our regulatory application in outside of life science, but it's new. It needs more features. We have our top 20 CPG that's rolling out QualityOne through all of their manufacturing sites, but they're less than halfway through that. And they have to get through that and then we have to optimize that. So, we are really focused on the customer success. Now, we are incrementally adding headcount in the field. That's for sure. But we feel we'll be tremendously successful outside of life sciences if we buckle down, stay true to the Veeva way and use these projects to make our products excellent. And what can get in the way there is if it becomes a sales game and you're just trying to complete as many sales as you can with a product that's not quite ready. Now one thing to know is we don't feel competitive pressure outside of life sciences. We're doing something quite unique there with this Vault platform, with applications for quality, regulatory, clinical, and claims. So, it's not that we're competing with anybody in that. We're sort of also evangelizing or espousing this model outside of life sciences that you can get this and there is value in that, and that takes time.\nKirk Materne: Great. Thanks very much for taking the questions.\nOperator: I apologize. We are out of time. I'll now turn it back to Peter for closing remarks.\nPeter Gassner: Thanks, everyone, for your time today. And we'd like to thank our employees for their dedication, as well as our customers and partners for their trust and partnership. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Matt Wallach",
            "content": "Hey, Ken. It's Matt. So, we're already being aggressive in these markets. We've aggressively added people on to the product teams. And we've just announced that first product specifically for those three market segments. And we've continued to add salespeople in the US and Europe. So, it feels like we're being aggressive already. Now, we also are reminding everyone \u2013 we're still learning a lot, right? So, this is not just another application that goes right in the bag of the life sciences rep and we just turn the crank. Not that those are easy, but there are more moving parts on these. And so, because we're going after multiple types of companies in multiple market segments, with multiple products and now a brand new product, there's still a lot for us to learn. But I would say, we are already being aggressive here in making sure that early customers are super successful and that we use that and start the reference selling. Bhavan, this is Matt. I'll actually take that one. So, because we have so many of the large customers, top 50 pharma companies already, the vast majority of incremental revenue is going to come from existing customers. So, that's just going to be the dynamic for Veeva going forward. We have multiple \u2013 we had a target of 20 eight-figure customers hopefully by the end of 2020 and it looks like we're on track for that. Those are really significant relationships. And when an existing customer buys one more Vault, it's certainly good for Veeva, but it's great for the customer because there's so many advantages that they get from having another enterprise product on the same platform. They get IT benefits, they get administrative benefits, and they get tremendous business benefits of having a single source of truth. So, in terms of incremental revenue, it's always going to be a larger number from existing customers because we have so many. But the long tail of smaller customers is also important. Some of those customers are going to become big. Some of those customers, if they go with competitors could help competitors get large. So, those companies are important to us from every different angle. But the large revenue story is going to come from existing customers, and I think we'll see that over time. Hi, Stan. Yeah, this is Matt. Thanks for the call out. I'm actually going to let Paul answer the question now. This is Matt. It's a good question, Brian. So, that was the number of new logos. So, companies that bought their very first Vault. And so, that is \u2013 it's going to be because of success of those Vaults that they bought at other customers. So, is it because there's so many Vaults? I guess, yeah. That would contribute to it that there's going to be more opportunities, more shots on goal per se. But I think that what is driving faster adoption by new companies is that these companies are all in the same industry. The overarching objective of people that work in the life sciences industry is to help patients. And so, what we find \u2013 and the reason why I referenced selling is so intense is because, if they can help another company help patients, they'll do it. So, our happy customers are pretty eager to talk to prospects about their use of Vault. And because their use has been so positive across so many of these applications, we're getting a lot of opportunity to introduce Vault to new companies. Yeah. I don't think it's too early to think that way. When we first invented Vault, I remember the very first PowerPoint slide we put together was Vault as an enterprise platform. So, the idea was that companies would make that part of the electricity that runs the company. And we thought it could take four, five, six years before we got there.

            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Q1 was another quarter of consistent execution across the company. Total revenue was nearly $245 million, up from over $195 million one year ago, a 25% increase. Vault represented nearly 50% of total revenue, up from 44% in Q1 of last year.  Subscription revenue grew 27% to $198 million, from $156 million last year. Outperformance in this metric was driven by a very strong bookings quarter, favorable linearity of those bookings, and a tailwind of a couple million dollars more from 606 as compared to Q1 of last year. Services revenue was almost $47 million, up 18% from roughly $40 million one year ago. Strength in services revenue continues to come primarily from R&D Vault projects. I expect Q2 services revenues to be roughly flat with Q1. Our non-GAAP operating income came in over $93 million, a 38% operating margin, which was above the high end of our guide. This was driven primarily by outperformance on the top line. Across the company, we added 92 people net in the quarter, finishing at 2,645, up from 2,243 one year ago. Turning to the balance sheet, deferred revenue was $364 million compared to $356 million at the end of Q4. Calculated billings for the first quarter came in at $247 million, which was ahead of our guidance of $235 million. This result was primarily driven by strong bookings and outperformance in services revenue. The year-over-year growth rate of calculated billings was 16% in the first quarter. When considering that growth rate, please remember that calculated billings in Q1 of last year included an $18 million renewal of a large customer that subsequently shifted its renewal date to Q4. Adjusting for this, year-over-year calculated billings growth for the quarter would have been 26%. Please remember that there are numerous factors that make year-over-year comparisons of this metric highly variable on a quarterly basis. Therefore, we do not believe it is a good indicator of the underlying momentum of our business and we do not manage to it internally. Our subscription revenue guidance and calculated billings guidance for the full fiscal year are the best indicators of our momentum. Looking ahead, we expect calculated billings of roughly $220 million in Q2 and a range of $1.115 billion to $1.120 billion for the full year, which is an increase from the $1.100 billion guidance provided last quarter. We continue to expect about 41% to 42% of our billings for the year to come in Q4.  Elsewhere on the balance sheet, we exited Q1 with over $1.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from almost $1.1 billion at the end of Q4. This increase was driven by our performance in cash from operations, which came in at $236 million and included $14 million in excess tax benefit related to equity compensation. For the full year, we now expect cash from operations to be $330 million to $335 million excluding this excess tax benefit. This is an increase from our previous expectations for slightly more than $320 million, excluding the excess tax benefit. Let me wrap up by sharing the rest of our outlook for next quarter and for fiscal 2020. For the second quarter, we expect revenue between $259 million and $260 million, non-GAAP operating income of $94 million to $95 million, and non-GAAP net income per share of $0.48 to $0.49 based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 158.5 million. For the year, we expect revenue in the range of $1.045 billion to $1.050 billion, representing a $20 million increase from our previous guidance. We expect subscription revenue to grow roughly 24%. And within that, we expect Commercial Cloud subscription revenue growth of at least 11%, and Vault subscription revenue growth of roughly 40%. For fiscal 2020, we anticipate non-GAAP operating income of $385 million to $390 million, a margin of about 37%. This is an increase in both dollars and margin from our previous guidance of $365 million to $370 million and a margin of almost 36%. As you consider this margin guidance, note that we have an aggressive hiring plan for the rest of the year and we are expecting increasing litigation fees as we move into the next phase of our cases. We are now targeting non-GAAP net income per share of between $2.01 and $2.03 based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 159 million. To conclude, it was a great start to the year. Our product teams continue to lead the industry forward with innovation and our field teams continue to deliver customer success. Given this consistent execution, we remain confident in our ability to deliver at least 20% subscription revenue growth through calendar 2020. As always, thank you for joining the call and I will now turn it back to the operator for questions. Yeah. Ken, this is Tim. I think you sort of answered the question a bit. It is a combination of all those things. Certainly, Q1 represented a very strong start to the year for Vault. We are seeing strength across the board, across the entire development cloud. And the contributing products are the ones that we've seen contribute in the past, meaning eTMF had a great quarter, CTMS had a very good quarter, QualityDocs had a good quarter, and we also had a good quarter on Regulatory. So, across-the-board strength and a really strong start to the year enabled us not only to raise the Vault subscription revenue guidance roughly 40%, but the overall subscription revenue guidance to roughly 24%. Yeah. Scott, I would say we are seeing leverage in G&A. But we're also, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, seeing increasing litigation fees for a couple of the lawsuits that we're working on and that is hiding the leverage we're seeing within G&A. Yes. Stan, thanks for the question. We had a really good quarter from a hiring perspective. I think you're right. There was probably a little bit more back-end loaded linearity. But, overall, it was a very strong quarter. The one thing that I did say as it relates to the outperformance of revenue in my prepared remarks, especially on the subscription revenue line is, couple more million of 606 impact than we had seen last year. And, Stan, I think you probably know this, that is 100% margin. So, that drops right down to the bottom line with no cost of goods sold and no really operating expenses against it. So, I think that also benefited the operating margin performance. But I would say, lastly, that the operating margin of a little over 38% was fairly consistent with what we saw in the second half of last year in terms of what the operating model is starting to firm up and look like as we go forward. Yeah, James. Thanks for the question. We haven't talked specifically this year about outside life sciences in terms of what the contribution is. What I would say qualitatively is what Peter and Matt said earlier, which is we're seeing really good early progress with our early adopter customers. The innovation that we're seeing from the product team, you heard in Peter's prepared remarks, that the momentum continues to be strong. We haven't specifically quantified what the size of that business is at this time now. Yeah. So, Brian, on the services side of Vault, we have a really strong team there, a lot of good domain expertise in that team. And as you've seen us grow the Vault business over time, obviously, a lot of pattern recognition on best practices that a company like Veeva can be a cross-pollinator or a pollinator of best practices across the industry. So, that's happening. In terms of the capacity model, we continue to not only build talent through our Generation Veeva, which is our college recruiting engine which has gone fabulously well over the years, certainly in the last couple of years. We've accelerated that. As well as finding great people in the industry. So, we're not necessarily capacity constrained. And one other thing I would add to that, Brian, is, over time, like you saw in Commercial Cloud, we've built quite a nice ecosystem of partners in the US and Europe, primarily, and starting to some early stages in Asia. So, from a capacity perspective, we're in good shape given those dynamics."

            "content": "Thank you, Rick. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report another great quarter with results ahead of our guidance. Total revenue for the quarter was $245 million, up 25% year-over-year. Subscription revenue grew 27% year-over-year and our non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. It was an outstanding start to the year. Congratulations to the Veeva team and thank you to our customers for your continued partnership. I'll share some Q1 highlights starting on the commercial side of the business where we had another excellent quarter. We continue to extend our market leadership in core CRM. We added many new Veeva CRM customers on the SMB side in both the US and Europe. Many of these customers also purchased Veeva OpenData at the same time. We also made good progress with global CRM rollouts in existing enterprise customers.  CRM add-ons also saw further adoption. Events management, Align, and Engage continued to do well. For example, a top 20 pharma added more than 700 Engage users in Europe after their success with initial pilots last year. We hosted our Commercial Summit a few weeks ago in Philadelphia. With more than 1,600 attendees, it was our biggest event to date and is the largest of its kind in the industry. The feeling and sense of community was great. It's one of the highlights of our year. We and our customers always get a lot of ideas and energy from Summit. The major Summit themes were customer success and the emerging use of AI in multiple areas of our commercial cloud. In CRM, for instance, we announced Veeva CRM Approved Notes, which will use AI to reduce the compliance risk of taking free text notes, providing field reps a better way to manage relationships with doctors. Approved Notes will be part of our core CRM subscription and is planned for release early next year. Customers are excited about Approved Notes and our continued investment and innovation in CRM overall. In Commercial, there is a strong desire to do more with AI and advanced analytics. At last year's Summit, we announced we would build our first AI application, Veeva Andi. Veeva Andi is an artificial intelligence application designed to provide customer insights and next best action recommendations right in Veeva CRM. I'm happy to announce that Andi is now available. We had a lot of great discussions about Andi at Summit and are developing a pipeline of early adopter candidates. Overall, it was another great Commercial Summit. Turning to Veeva Vault. In Q1, we added almost 50 new Vault customers, which was a quarterly record. We saw strength across each Vault application area, including early success with new products and continued momentum with more established products. We won our first top 20 enterprise deal for CDMS. This is a big milestone for the product and for Veeva. The customer was looking for a cloud EDC solution on a proven platform.  The existing enterprise EDC offerings are older systems and are not true cloud applications. The customer also liked some of the innovative ways our system handles data entry, data review, and protocol amendments, as well as our vision for comprehensive data cleaning and reporting with Data Workbench. The customer had trust in Veeva because our teams have delivered success for them in multiple areas over the past eight years, both in R&D and commercial. They completed some pilot studies with CDMS in the last nine months and that went well. So, last quarter, they decided to move forward with a multiyear enterprise deal for CDMS. This was a great win for Veeva. One of our top company priorities is to ensure the success of this project and to use it to drive innovation in CDMS. We also signed a multi-product deal with a top 20 pharma in Europe for Vault in the clinical and regulatory areas. This customer just went live with Vault QualityDocs for over 50,000 users around the world. After working with our product and services teams on the QualityDocs implementation, they decided to go forward with eTMF submissions and submissions archive. This is a great example of customer success leading the way to future business. We have also signed our first four early adopters for Vault Safety, our newest product line in development cloud. It's still early days for Safety and these were small deals with small companies, but I'm pleased with our overall progress. Product is maturing every day and we have a growing pipeline of early adopter candidates. Safety is a mission-critical application for life sciences. It's complex and will have many integration points with our other Vault applications, so having a modern solution on a single platform is a great thing for the industry. Turning to our business outside of life sciences where we are concentrating on consumer goods, chemicals, and cosmetics. We recently announced a new application, Vault Claims. Claims will help manage the product claims lifecycle, from creation to approval to marketing usage. When speaking with early QualityOne customers, we saw a real need for a claims management application. We have already started a Claims project at a new top 20 CPG customer and have early discussions underway with others. Progress with QualityOne continues as well, both expansions in existing customers and bringing on new customers. For example, this quarter, we closed an initial QualityOne deal with another major cosmetics company. While still early, we're finding that companies are responding to our product offerings in consumer goods, chemicals, and cosmetics. In closing, we had another great quarter. We executed well across all areas, focused on customer success and product excellence, and had exceptional traction in new markets.  With that, I'll turn it over to Tim to review our financial results in more detail. Thanks, Tom. This is Peter. As far as the competitive landscape for the deal, we're certainly competitive. This is a longstanding customer of Veeva's that had one of the large enterprise players for CDMS and had that for many years. So, there was no formal RFP process, but there was certainly a selection process. And in terms of what they were looking for, the CDMS is really \u2013 it's a very critical process for pharmaceutical companies. They're trying to collect clinical data from these research sites. The faster and more accurate they can do it, the better chance they have of completing their clinical trials and completing them quickly. So, it's a really, really mission-critical application. And they just needed a true-cloud system that had better data collection and workflow. Just really a better system overall and a chance to be great. I think that's what they were looking for, is a chance to be great. So, it's competitive and we won. In terms of the size of the deal or you mentioned the wallet share, CTMS is a bigger, larger application than \u2013 sorry, CDMS is a bigger and larger application than CTMS. So, to give you an idea, this deal, it's a multi-year deal. It will roll out over time; and at the full rollout, it will be an eight-figure per year deal. So, it's certainly a significant application area for us. It's our largest single Vault application. Yeah. I'd say it's a combination of both. This is a different area, the clinical data management area, which is different than the clinical operations area where you will have CTMS and eTMF. So, it's certainly a different area of the pharmaceutical company. We need specialized product consultants and specialized salespeople, but they do work with the broader R&D sales team. So, it's a combination of specialization for certain people and then tying it together to the broader Veeva R&D Vision. Thanks, Tom. In terms of outside of life sciences \u2013 this is Peter \u2013 we're still early there. So, we have a basic blocking and tackling to do our new claims product. What's going on outside of life sciences is we're learning a lot. We're developing deep customer relationships. And what we're finding is they have a need for a partner in the quality, regulatory, clinical and claims area of consumer packaged goods companies. What claim am I making about this new product? How fast can I get things, like the label, approved? When I change ingredients, how do I need to do my regulatory filings in the different countries? If I were to have a complaint on this product, how do I register that? If I need to change a process, how can I do that in a compliant way? So, that claims quality, legal/regulatory set of things is very highly related. And there is a need for that integrated in together all on the same platform. So, that's what we're focused on. AI will come outside of life sciences, but not in the immediate future. Thank you. Yeah, I can take that one. Yeah, it has to be phased in because, in the clinical data management system, there's many people inside of the customer that work with many different groups from data management people to the statistical type people to the people that do the clinical monitoring. And there's also people in the research side that deal with these systems too. So, there will be a phased approach because you have to train people up and get them going on it. Yeah, at some point, it will be all clinical trials, all new ones started on Veeva. That may be all between 18 months or so from now or two years from now. That's how long it will take. Because, for example, in a therapeutic area where you have multiple related trials and you have some system of reuse going on on the existing system, you're going to be a little hesitant to break off the sort of add-on trial and put it on the new system. You're going to want to keep that with the family of other related trials. So, it's a nuanced thing, but certainly in the \u2013 two years from now, we would expect the bulk of the trials to be on our system. Yeah. That's on an annual basis at the terminal. When it's fully ramped up, the subscription fees \u2013 and that rolls out over several years, but not getting into the specifics of how many years. But that's \u2013 the figure I quoted there for eight figures was on an annual basis at the terminal run rate. Thank you. Yes, it will. Safety will. Now, it will have a slightly different flavor to it because of the process is different and the regulatory bodies are different, drug safety versus consumer product safety. And that's something \u2013 for the safety products outside of life sciences, that is not for the immediate interest [ph]. We feel that Safety inside of life sciences, that's going to keep us really busy. And it's a mission-critical large applications. So, we're talking probably a couple years out for safety outside of life sciences. Yeah. So, Nitro is doing really well. And the quarter we had a couple of early customers go live. In fact, we had three customers speak at our customer summit. One was on the main stage and then two shared very detailed presentations about the benefits they're getting from Nitro, which is getting metrics out to the field, into their promo office faster, putting that foundation in for AI. So, our customers, the early adopters, are doing very well. We've also added some customers to Nitro also. That growth that we have there is really measured. We're focused on early adopters and customer success in the early market. We're unfortunately still seeing some of the anti-competitive behavior from IQVIA. So, that's creating some headwinds for us with Nitro. And we're hopeful that we're able to get that resolved over time. But, yeah, that has been an impact so far. Yeah. I think it was certainly noticed in the industry. Clinical data management is a tight community. They are kind of scientifically oriented, fact oriented, really interested in the patient outcomes and getting therapies out to patients, getting therapies approved. So, information flows fast. I would say faster in the scientific and clinical community. It flows faster than in the commercial communities. So, there's a lot of interest. We've seen an uptick in conversations. I think there is an uptick in customers' thinking, 'well, maybe that could be possible for me.' So, there is more interest, I think, in pilots by large customers. Now, whether that will turn into fruition or not, that's something that we'll see over the next 12 months. But, certainly, the interest is up. And I think a lot of eyes are on this project. How successful will it be? There's a lot of people wanting to know that. This is Peter. It's overall good execution. Good execution in our product, good execution in our field, that's number one. You can't take those things for granted, right? We used to have a saying, we say execution matters most. It's what you do every day, every week, every month, every quarter. A grand idea is just a grand idea. So, I think it's just consistent great effort by the Veeva team in partnership by our customers. That's the bulk of what's going on. Now, what that \u2013 I guess there's a couple other things. There's a backdrop involved. We now have 17 Vault applications and they are for very specific areas, diverse sets of areas. So, that does create a halo effect. Customers are starting to see, wow, I can \u2013 my internal operations can be much more efficient with Veeva. I can get a lot of applications, they're integrated together, and the projects are generally successful and I like working with the people. So, with 17 applications, now there's more bites at the apple with any particular customer. So, I think those are the two things going on. And then reputation. Reputation grows every year with continued success, as long as you continue to have success. So, the longer we have success, the reputation grows. We have more products and we are continuing \u2013 the Veeva team is continuing to hustle every day, go the extra mile for the customer. So, that's it. No real magic, but just great execution. Yeah, I would just add on to that broadly speaking. Some AI is going to be added into the existing subscriptions. Some are going to be brand new AI applications that are a subscription on their own. And I wouldn't be surprised if we have transaction-oriented AI pricing in the future where it fits. So, Veeva \u2013 the thing to remember is Veeva will run to the complexity. We will really find the application that really, really fits for an area. And part of that is finding the pricing model that fits for that area, and that's going to depend on the use case just as it does in a transaction-oriented system, it can depend on the use case, and in the AI-oriented systems. Yeah. It is the right way to think about it, that claims is the brand new application. It's in a separate Vault from the QualityOne Vault. It's a standalone. And the reason for that is, it's a very specific use case, has a different set of users and it rolls out in a different way.  So, for example, our first customer from four claims was a top 20 CPG customer. Now, it turns out this is the first application that they bought from Veeva because they had a very specific need in their own claims and it needs to roll-out on its own way. Now, that customer, and we believe, will buy other products from Veeva over time. So, now in terms of the margin hit, the other applications QualityOne and the regulatory, they need effort and specific features for outside of life sciences. So, I would see no really difference in the margin hit. This will be small things that you won't be able to see in terms of overall costs. You have to remember that we are getting a lot of leverage from the Vault platform. That is, if you look at the maturity of the Vault platform now versus even two years ago, it's pretty striking. Like, that's the \u2013 if you look at the iceberg where most of the effort is under the covers, most of the effort in our product area is actually under the covers in our Vault platform. You see the application sales, but the leverage and the operating model and the power of the sales is actually a lot of it coming through the Vault platform where we've made tremendous strides really over the last two, three years. Yeah. That's a great question, right. As we think back to 2015, quite some time ago now and we had the plan, so the basic question is what went better than expected. I would say, the number one thing is that nothing bad happened, right? And when you're making that long range of a plan, you have to assume that there will be some unexpected bad news along the way, right? Nothing bad happened. I guess, since 2015, we've roughly doubled the size of the company, close to or so. And we've retained our energy. And, in fact, got some acceleration, I think. We've actually gotten more efficient as we've got larger. More efficient in our selling \u2013 I don't think we anticipated that we would get more efficient as we grew larger. So, that's happened well. I think those are really the things. Outstanding execution, good decisions on process, and no unexpected bad news, and so we got there. And I would say, along the way, we probably had some key things that just happened to break our way and that accelerated us. Yeah. I would say we're early days. We're really focused more on the customer success. We just introduced this claims application, for example. We have some customers using our regulatory application in outside of life science, but it's new. It needs more features. We have our top 20 CPG that's rolling out QualityOne through all of their manufacturing sites, but they're less than halfway through that. And they have to get through that and then we have to optimize that. So, we are really focused on the customer success. Now, we are incrementally adding headcount in the field. That's for sure. But we feel we'll be tremendously successful outside of life sciences if we buckle down, stay true to the Veeva way and use these projects to make our products excellent. And what can get in the way there is if it becomes a sales game and you're just trying to complete as many sales as you can with a product that's not quite ready. Now one thing to know is we don't feel competitive pressure outside of life sciences. We're doing something quite unique there with this Vault platform, with applications for quality, regulatory, clinical, and claims. So, it's not that we're competing with anybody in that. We're sort of also evangelizing or espousing this model outside of life sciences that you can get this and there is value in that, and that takes time. Thanks, everyone, for your time today. And we'd like to thank our employees for their dedication, as well as our customers and partners for their trust and partnership. Thank you."

            "name": "Paul Shawah",
            "content": "Hey, Bhavan. This is Paul. Thanks for the question. Yeah. So, on Andi... Yeah. Good to speak. So, this is something we announced a year ago at our Summit. And then, at the time, we didn't have a product and we didn't have a team focused on it. And at this Summit this year, we actually demoed the product and showed a real life product to customers and there was tremendous interest. We had hundreds of customers attend sessions focused on Andi. So, there is a very significant halo effect because of the excitement around the product and the potential for what it can deliver. Andi is focused on delivering suggestions, next best actions to customers, which really we believe will have a significant impact on a potential to have sales uplift for our customers. So, there's a lot of excitement, there's a lot of potential for what Andi can deliver and we are focused on improving a lot of that out in our early adopter program which we're kicking off over the next couple of months. That's next for us. In terms of \u2013 the one other thing I'd say just beyond Andi is just around the concept of embedding AI into the application. So, at Summit, we had also two big announcements, one in the CRM space that Peter alluded to called Approved Notes, which is where we're using AI to drive better compliance as sales reps and they use free text in their comments. We'll use AI to drive better compliance around that \u2013 compliance and visibility to all the notes that they have in the system. That's super valuable to customers. That resonated extremely well. And then, also on the Vault side, as you mentioned, we're starting in Vault PromoMats with AI doing Auto Claim Linking. So, what that means is that you make a claim about a specific product, you have to link that back to the underlying reference material. So, we're already getting interest and excitement around Vault for AI and we're already making some strides in terms of embedding that in there, and I think you'll see more of that in the future. Hey, Stan. How are you. This is Paul. I get to steal this one from Matt. So, yeah, really excellent quarter in Commercial, as you've heard. I wouldn't attribute the strength in Commercial to any one thing in particular. I'd actually \u2013 the strength is really from \u2013 broadly in CRM and across the add-ons in general. So, to be more specific, in CRM, we saw significant expansion from global customers, existing customers who were completing their global rollouts as they went and expanded into new markets. We also saw expansions from existing customers as they launch new drugs and they get approval and they build out a sales team. We've seen growth there as well. And also, on the SMB side, we continue to win the vast majority of those deals also. So, that's continuing to add to the strength. And that foundation for CRM that we're building is giving us really the right foundation to sell the additional add-ons to and we've seen that pull through in this quarter as well with really great traction from events. And then, some of the other add-ons that are building momentum like Engage, for example, which is newer, we had customers speak at our customer summit talking about how they're changing the selling model, how they're getting access to customers, to doctors, that they've never been able to get access to in face to face, they're now accessing them in a video call and they're getting more time on video than they would've face to face. So, we're starting to see that traction pull-through on the add-on side. So, I would say that strength is really CRM and the add-ons pretty consistently. That is correct. Yeah, those would be drivers [indiscernible]. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Hey, Brent. So, this is Paul. You mentioned two things there. One was Nitro and the other was Andi. So, I'll take them separately. Nitro is the commercial data warehouse. And there's certainly a monetization concept around Nitro which will be driven by, basically, the size of the organization. We're using field users as a metric for that. And that's a significant opportunity and we've talked about being roughly the size of CRM. That's a foundation for AI. It's not necessarily the AI capability. It's what AI is driven from. Andi is the application engine, and that does a very specific thing. That drives insights and it drives suggestions directly to the field. People in industry typically talk about that as next best action and we'll also monetize that as well. And that's on a per user, per month basis for our customers. And then, you also heard Peter in his prepared remarks talk about some of the AI that we're building into the application. And some of those components are just about really driving efficiency, making the application more smart \u2013 kind of smarter or more compliant, and some of those are differentiating and just value-adds that just are part of the existing license. So, what Peter talked about as Approved Notes, that's part of the Veeva CRM core license. And what we talked about is Auto Claim Linking, that's part of the Vault PromoMats license. So, you see a little bit of a mix of both where some are kind of very specific products and then others are embedded into the application."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Ato Garrett, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAto Garrett: Good afternoon, and welcome to Veeva's fiscal 2021 fourth quarter and full year earnings call for the quarter and year ended January 31, 2021. With me on today's call are Peter Gassner, our Chief Executive Officer; Paul Shawah, EVP, Strategy; and Brent Bowman, our Chief Financial Officer. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding trends, our strategies, and the anticipated performance of the business. These forward-looking statements will be based on management's current views and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those related to the impacts of COVID-19 on our business, life sciences industry and global economic conditions. Our actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the risks listed in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our most recent filing on Form 10-Q, which is available on the company's Web site at www.veeva.com under the Investors section, and on the SEC\u2019s Web site at www.sec.gov. Forward-looking statements made during the call today are being made as of today, March 2, 2021, based on the facts available to us today. If this call is replayed or viewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Veeva disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today's call, but we'll not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. The guidance we will provide today is in part based on our current assumptions as to the macroeconomic environment in which we will be operating in the future, including the timing and pace of recovery from any negative effects caused by COVID-19. Such matters that are beyond our control and our assumptions may not be correct and may change rapidly. On the call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today's earnings release and in the supplemental investor presentation, both of which are available on our Web site. A reconciliation can also be found as an exhibit to Form 8-K filed with the SEC just before this call. With that, thank you for joining us, and I'll turn it over to Peter.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you, Ato. So first, I'd like to thank our life sciences customers for their incredible efforts over the last year. The COVID-19 genome was only sequenced about a year ago, and we now already have safe and effective vaccines, diagnostics and therapies. That's just amazing speed. COVID-19 was also disruptive to the healthcare systems overall, and the industry really stepped up to support doctors and patients around the world. 2020 was a transformational year for Life Sciences and to Veeva. The scale and speed of innovation from the Veeva team enabled the industry to adapt quickly and work in new ways. Thanks to the team for your outstanding execution against our important mission. Turning to our results, Veeva delivered exceptional performance for the quarter and year, total revenue was 397 million up 27% year over year. Subscription revenue also grew 27% year over year, and non-GAAP operating margin was 39%. Our full fiscal year revenue was 1.46 billion up 33% year-over-year and subscription revenue was $1.18 billion up 32% year-over-year. In commercial we further extended our leadership position with commercial cloud customer growth and the development of important new products that will set us up for future growth over the long-term. In Q4, we had 17 new customer wins for core CRM and a number of international expansions with existing enterprise accounts. It was also a standout quarter for Veeva CRM Engage as customers move to paid subscriptions at the end of the 2023 period. We are pleased with the adoption of Engage and expect high attach rates with new customers as they look to digital capabilities to drive field efficiency. I'm also very pleased with the progress in Veeva Data Cloud. In Q4, we released patient data for the U.S. and now have five early adopter customers. We are also [preparing] [ph] our data with other customers and the feedback is encouraging. In multiple cases, we were able to identify patients and prescribers that were not available in their existing datasets. Looking ahead, we expect to have prescribers and sales data available for the U.S. by the end of the year, offering for additional countries will come over time. It's early days, but we're excited by the potential of Veeva Data Cloud to help the industry in an area that's been stagnant for too long. Having great data, software and business consulting is allowing us to build deeper partnerships with the industry. We're starting to see increasing interest among biotechs to go all in with Veeva partnering with us from the very start to define and operationalize the digital first commercial strategy. In Q4, we had a second biotech in the U.S. go all in with us in this way. To put the breadth of our full offering in context, core CRM is roughly 20% of the opportunity, when a customer goes all in with commercial cloud in the U.S. There's a major long-term potential for Veeva in commercial if we execute well on our vision. This year, our focus is to continue to innovate in our products and optimize our delivery and support for this approach by partnering deeply with a handful of early adopters. As we look back on the year, I'd also like to share the two acquisitions we made about 18 months ago, Crossix and physicians world are integrated and operating well. We further invested in Crossix growing the team by more than 50% since acquisition. The growth is mostly in the data science area as we expand the Crossix data platform. Our event services business that was physicians world made a quick pivot when the pandemic hit and has been helping lead the industry in digital events. We expect these new businesses to continue to thrive, growing roughly in line with Veeva overall in the year ahead. On the R&D side, we had another great quarter across the board with wins and go lives in clinical, quality, regulatory and safety. The industry is starting to really appreciate the power of vault development cloud to streamline drug development end-to-end. We closed the year with more than 850 vault customers overall, quality and regulatory had a record number of wins in the year, the Vault RIM and Vault Quality suites are adding significant value to the industry as they are the only offerings that can truly unify these important functions. It was also a big year for clinical. One major milestone was involved CDMS, in 2016, we set out to build a better EDC, the first product in CDMS and we believe we are now there. While EDC allows customers to build and execute studies more quickly than before and get access to crucial trial data faster. The impact on a customer's trial speed and agility has been significant and the industry is starting to take notice. In fact, we just announced that six of the top seven CROs have joined the Vault CDMS Partner Program, which is further validation of the strength of Vault CDMS. Having a critical mass of CRO partners will make it easier for smaller customers to use Vault CDMS because they often leverage the technology provided by their CRO partner. We have also made excellent progress with Veeva clinical network to connect site, patients and sponsors. This is a bold vision for the industry that over time has the potential to make trials 25% faster at 25% less cost. It's still early days for clinical network, but we have the key building blocks in place. We have seven customers signed up and the first few customers just went live with their first site on Site Connect, which is our first clinical network application. Site Connect link sponsors and the clinical research sites together to make study startup and study execution faster and more compliant. MyVeeva for patients is another important part of the clinical network. The first application in MyVeeva for patients is eConsent. And we're already working with a few early adopters. In fact, we had our very first patient use MyVeeva to sign an electronic consent form last Friday. That's a big milestone for clinical network. We're really excited about having patients use Veeva applications directly. Overall, it's been great to see so much progress, innovation and exceptional execution across the board in commercial and R&D. Looking outside of Life Sciences, we had another solid quarter with new customer wins and expansions in consumer goods and chemicals. In Q4, a top 20 nutrition company selected RegulatoryOne. Despite COVID related disruption and a significant downturn in the cosmetics industry. They had a good year overall outside of Life Sciences with revenue over 30 million as expected. Before we close, I wanted to share that in February Veeva officially became a public benefit corporation. Our proposal passed by an overwhelming majority vote. Thank you to our shareholders for your support in this important decision. This move was about the future of Veeva over the decades to come and ensuring the company continues to operate in consideration of all stakeholders. But we are also seeing a positive effect right now in attracting talent to Veeva and in deepening our customer relationships. I also posted a medium article with my personal perspective on the importance of public benefit corporations more broadly. In all, it was a year of exceptional innovation and execution across the board. We're in a stronger position than ever with the right team, customers, products and vision to fuel our growth to 2025 and beyond. I'll now turn it over to Brent to discuss the details of our financial performance.\nBrent Bowman: Thanks, Peter. The fourth quarter was a great close to another year of outstanding execution for Veeva. We had record bookings in the quarter driven by our continued momentum across our development cloud product suites and Veeva CRM Engage. Development cloud performed extremely well with a record bookings quarter, including particular strength in CTMS and QMS. In commercial cloud core CRM and add on products over bookings performance in the quarter. Engage conversions were extremely strong and we believe captured roughly 60% of the total dollar opportunity. This will be a tailwind to our fiscal year \u201822 commercial cloud subscription revenue. We expect Engage subscription revenue growth after fiscal year \u201822 will be similar to other CRM add-ons. Crossix had a strong bookings quarter and posted 79 million in subscription revenue for the year. Total revenue for Crossix and physicians world was 103 million with physicians\u2019 world benefiting from growth and virtual events in the second half of the year. These acquired businesses are fully integrated into our financial results and will not break them out in the future. Strong subscription bookings including Engaged [earnings] [ph] and services demand lead to calculate billings of 688 million, which was 48 million above guidance. Total billings includes 15 million from changes and billing terms at a few large customers, which was 5 million above our previous expectation for Q4. Our revenue retention rate for the year was 124%. This metric is defined in the earnings release, and reflects annualized subscription revenue growth within existing customers net of revenue attrition and continues to illustrate the increasing value we are providing to our customers and the industries we serve. We had another strong quarter of hiring, we ended the quarter with 4506 employees and net gain of 202 from the previous quarter. For the year, we added more than 1000 net new employees, the vast majority of which were in our field and product development teams. Fourth quarter operating margin was 38.6%, which exceeded guidance. Operating margin was driven by subscription revenue outperformance and a smaller than expected seasonal dip in our professional services business. As a reminder, our operating margin includes roughly a 250 basis point benefit from cost savings related to lower travel and event expenses, which was in line with the previous quarter, Operating cash flow for fiscal year '21 excluding the excess tax benefit was 471 million, which was below our guidance. Approximately 30 million of expected Q4 collections push to Q1 and were collected in the quarter. I'll now provide guidance for the first quarter in fiscal year '22. For Q1, we expect total revenue between 408 million and 410 million, the subscription revenue of roughly 330 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter between 157 million and 159 million. This includes a benefit from reduced travel and events similar to the past three quarters. Note that we have made some changes to our fiscal year '22 sales compensation plan as we do from time-to-time. These changes have resulted in approximately 3 million in incremental expense in Q1 and approximately 11 million for the full year. Q1 non-GAAP EPS is projected to be $0.77 to $0.78 based on a diluted share count of approximately 162 million. Please note that we are maintaining our non-GAAP tax rate at 21% for fiscal year '22 and we'll monitor this assumption for significant events including any relevant tax law changes. We expect calculated billings of roughly 392 million in Q1, which implies year-over-year growth of about 17%. This reflects approximately 4 million of billings that moved into Q4 from Q1 related to the changes in billing terms we mentioned earlier. If we account for this dynamic, our normalized Q1 billings growth would be closer to 19%. Please remember that there are numerous factors that make year-over-year comparisons of this metric highly variable on a quarterly basis. Therefore, we do not believe quarterly billings growth is a good indicator of the underlying momentum of our business and we do not manage to it internally. Our subscription revenue guidance and calculated billings guidance for the full year are better indicators of our momentum. Turning toward guidance for the full fiscal year '22. We expect total revenue of $1.755 billion to $1.765 billion, a 45 million increase to the high-end of our prior guidance. Expect subscription revenue of approximately $1.430 billion consisting of Vault subscription revenue of roughly 750 million and commercial cloud of roughly 680 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income of about 655 million. Investing for growth is a priority for the year. Our guidance reflects investments with new data suppliers for our Data Cloud products and additional hiring primarily in our field and product development teams. We expect travel and event related expenses to start to increase in the back half of the year. We expect calculated billings of approximately $1.870 billion which reflects a 17% year-over-year growth rate. If we adjust for changes in customer billing terms in fiscal year '21, which totaled approximately 17 million, our guidance would imply normalized billings growth of roughly 18%. We expect about 42% of full year billings to be in Q4. We expect non-GAAP EPS for the full year of approximately $3.20 based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 163 million. Finally, we expect full year cash flow from operations, excluding the excess tax benefits of about 635 million. In closing, I'm very happy with our strong momentum exiting the fourth quarter and the growth we expect in the coming year. We are well positioned to achieve our 2025 target of 3 billion in revenue. Thanks for joining us today. And now I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question will be from Ken Wong of Guggenheim.\nKen Wong: Fantastic quarter guys. This one is for you, Peter. So can you maybe give us a little bit of feedback from what you're hearing from customers on this transition to a PBC? And then perhaps more importantly, you've been pretty public with your call to arms for other industry leaders to follow your lead? What kind of feedback are you getting from other executives, within Life Sciences and perhaps even outside on this potential change to a public benefit corporation?\nPeter Gassner: Ken, thanks for the excellent question. For customers, it's helping. It's a discussion starter. And it also is a very concrete way to say what Veeva is all about not just because we're saying it, because we wrote it in our charter that we're committed to the industry, to society and to our employees, not just to our shareholders. So they can depend on Veeva long-term and it's absolutely helping. It's also helping in recruiting. We have people, a number of people seeking us out and they want to be part of that. So I wouldn't say there's an unexpected, also thing that that's happening, I think it's helping us generate new ideas. It's exposing us to a different ecosystem of ideas that will be positive for Veeva in the long-term. In terms of other companies, certainly I've had reached out from others and they're interested in it. I think rightfully so this is a board decision the PBC matter. So this is something that plays out over years really this is not a snap decision and it may be right for other companies the PBCs and it may not be right for them. So I try to stay neutral on that and just provide whatever advice and guidance I can about how it fits for Veeva.\nKen Wong: And if it makes you feel better, we've been hearing it from investors that it's positive. And also I've had other companies that we follow actually reach out to get some color on and on what you guys are doing and what that could potentially tell from a benefit perspective. And then, the follow up for Brent, just wanted to touch on the commercial cloud growth, you called 680 million, looks like that's kind of a mid teens growth rate. I think a lot of us were expecting a bit of a [desell] [ph] there with you guys highlighting a potential cut in pharma sales reps last quarter. Can you maybe walk us through some of the assumptions that are in there? And is there any seasonality we should be aware of to the extent that there are going to be some reductions in sales reps and how that might feather into outlook?\nPeter Gassner: So why don't I take the first part about the headcount reductions? And then, I'll let Brent, answer your question about billings and impact on the financials. So from a headcount perspective, we first talked about that last quarter. So we know a little bit more now, we said we believed it was about a 10% reduction that'll happen about over the next year or so, we still think that's going to happen, we think it'll happen likely over the next one to two years. But, so far, we haven't seen the reductions happen broadly, across the industry haven't been industry wide reductions that we've seen in Q4. There's always ups and downs, it's a little bit up and a little bit down as companies shift. But there has not yet been anything that's been unusual or out of the ordinary. Now, having said that, why do we still believe it's going to happen? The context is important here that the industry has moved to digital. We helped the industry become more digital, you heard that in Brent's prepared remarks, we have now, about 60% of market share from an Engaged standpoint, the industry is using that that will make the industry more efficient, it will make them more effective and productive. They now have the opportunity to apply those efficiency gains to either reach more customers or to have reductions in the field force. And I think pharma is thinking about, what's, how do they optimize for that and that takes time. So we haven't seen the impact yet. But I do think that will play out. And we have included those reductions in that thinking within our guidance as well.\nBrent Bowman: Yes. Maybe I could add in, in the 13% growth that we guided to, we did see broad strength across the portfolio. So Crossix, core CRM and core CRM add-ons. We did have a pop in Engage. So that's probably the one item that would -- it flowed through our Q4 billings. And you'll see that flow through revenue through fiscal year '22. And then beyond that we expect Engage to grow more in line with other traditional add-ons.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Bryan Peterson of Raymond James.\nBryan Peterson: I kind of wanted to follow up on that. Just to clarify, so Engage, how do you think about the long-term penetration potential? And I think I just heard 60% market share? Is that of the total reps, is that penetration? I just want to make sure I understand this facet that you're giving and maybe what is the longer term kind of penetration potential that you see of that offering?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. So you're right, 60% is the -- of the total Engage opportunity. So as we think it's not as a percentage of the CRM seats that we have, it's what the total market for Engage. So, that happened, relatively quickly over the course of the last year, we knew we were there for the industry with the right products and technology and expertise to move the industry quickly. We'll see that impact hit our revenue, as Brent mentioned, largely this fiscal year. And then beyond that, you will see it grow more like a steady growing add-on. So most of the pop that we have seen has already hit in this current year. And then, beyond that, I think it'll see steady growth. And it may approach some of the cash rate to what we talked about with close to marketing and with approved email, which are a bit higher than where we're at with 60%.\nBryan Peterson: Okay, thanks for the clarification. And I just wanted to hit on the 17 new wins the core CRM. Obviously, you guys have a pretty significant market share leadership position there. I just be curious if you had to take a step back and think about the results for the core CRM this year, how did that perform versus your expectations and any thoughts on competitive dynamics in that space? Thank you.\nPeter Gassner: Yes, thanks. I can cover that also. So, yes, you're right. I mean, last quarter, we had 19 CRM wins, that was a record. This quarter, we had 17 CRM wins. As we look across those there, many of them are pre-commercial companies, a lot of them in the U.S. market. We are also seeing wins in Europe, but then even in some of the domestic markets, like in Brazil and in Japan. So, we're pleased with that we're winning most deals in terms of, the overall competitive landscape, we're gaining share, we've gained share, quarter-over-quarter, we've gained share year-over-year. And there's a reason for that the reason we're gaining shares, because particularly in really difficult times, like we're operating in companies are looking for a partner they can trust, they want a partner that can execute. This is all about execution, right, you have a field people that need to be productive in the field, they need a partner that they can trust. They also want a partner that can innovate with them and we've proven that. And they're also looking for somebody who has the domain expertise and the guidance to get them through to digital transformation. And that's what we've been doing over the last year. So from a competitive standpoint, our position has actually improved over the last year because it's really shined a light on the difference between how Veeva is operating and how rest of the -- others or other alternatives in the market appear. So really happy with progress from a competitive standpoint.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brad Sills of Bank of America.\nBrad Sills: And congratulations on a nice finish to the year. I wanted to ask about the comments made earlier, Peter on core CRM, only 20% penetrated in the overall commercial potential. Are there certain products or offerings that perhaps are further out when you think about, you're getting to 100%, over time, near term, obviously Engage is doing well, there's still some wins that you're executing on new customer wins. But we look further out, maybe, two, three years from now, maybe something that's on the roadmap might not be thinking about that, you think could be -- could have real upsides?\nPeter Gassner: Thanks, Brad. Yes, in terms of my comments there about the 20% of the opportunity, really referring to when we sell our complete commercial products that we have today, not talking about future products, but products that we have today in the U.S. market, when we sell that to a small biotech, when they go all in with us, the core CRM is about 20% of the opportunity today. So that the other 80% of that opportunity comes from the breadth of our products. Some of it is from the commercial content, there's a pretty good size chunk from data cloud and that chunk will grow Crossix is a sizable area that will grow. And then, we have the CRM add-ons and we also have Nitro. So when we look for this complete commercial, which we have today, in certain markets, like in the U.S., now its very early days, but we haven't, that's where the opportunity comes from. So we've come a really long way from the days where we just had CRM, now we have a long tail with the data and analytics products being the largest areas.\nBrad Sills: That's great. Thanks Peter. And then, one more if I may, please, just on the outside Life Sciences opportunity. 30 million of revenue is a nice milestone here. Where are you today, I know that you haven't really been investing aggressively kind of letting the product sell itself. And at some point perhaps getting more and more aggressively investing in that business to go after the opportunity, I guess? Where are you in that reference selling approach in some of these industries that you're going after consumers, consumer packaged goods, chemicals, et cetera?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, outside Life Sciences, we're focused on the consumer packaged goods, chemicals, and also cosmetics, although cosmetics has had a tough year here with the pandemic. And in that we're focused on the quality and the regulatory areas. So the market is of a certain size to put it in reference, it's about similar to our CDMS market size. And what I would consider it's a relatively slow and steady mover. So we're happy, we're deepening our customer engagements. But these are areas that don't move too fast. So to give the guidance on that, we have said before, we would like to have about $100 million business there in that segment of the market by 2025 and we're still on track for that. So things are going according to plan there outside Life Sciences.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Tom Roderick of Stifel.\nTom Roderick: Peter, I wanted to go back to your comment on CDMS. I think you said six of the top seven CROs are now partnered with you on that front. And perhaps that feeding the market more at the lower end or the emerging startup side, which I'd love to hear a little bit more about, but just talk a bit if you don't mind about how the CROs are kind of building up your presence in the CDMS side. And what that does mean for the other top 20s where I know that that would take a little bit more of share shift over time against some of the entrenched competitors. We'd love to hear more about that. Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: Yes, Tom, very, I consider that very significant six as a top seven CROs supporting Veeva in our partnership program, every one of the top seven CROs except for Quintiles. And that's significant, because that means that's what customers are asking for. CROs are very efficient, they focus on getting the work done. They don't want to lead into technology when customers aren't asking for it. So this means the customers are asking for this technology. And it means the CROs feel that they can be very efficient with Veeva. And over time now that takes a year or two to really work its way into the mid market ecosystem. But we're very bullish on that. I expect us to be the leader in the clinical data management market by roughly in the 2025 timeframe. It's a market that life sciences is cautious on and conservative, but we have the better product and I'm very pleased with our early adopter success with our customers. So I couldn't be happier. We entered that market in 2016 wrote the first line of code. And now we're set for leadership. So very enthused about that area.\nTom Roderick: Fantastic. That's great progress. And Brent, not to put too fine a point on it, but appreciate some of the details on the Engage sort of customer conversion and the success you're having on that. When you guide for the commercial cloud for this year, can you directionally just give us some sense as to how much of that acceleration on the organic front is being driven by Engage. And in sort of the reason by behind asking that is as we model out longer term, trying to think about what a more normalized commercial growth rate would be once we sort of lap the benefits of monetizing those Engage customers have been free from the last year.\nBrent Bowman: Yes. And we don't break out specific products in guiding and providing results. But with that a little texture. As we said in my prepared remarks, we gave you a sense of what we thought the dollar opportunity was that we had captured at 60%. The other piece of the equation is, we are trying to size that. So we've taught, if you think about sizing that we talked about percentage, of course, CRM. So we see that orienting around about 15%. So if you think about sizing that that's something to consider there. And the rest of our portfolio had outside of Engage how it would have a record commercial growth quarter bookings quarter. So we did have strength broadly outside of Engage.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Donald Hooker of KeyBanc.\nDonald Hooker: With curious if you've had any kind of take on the sort of some of the changes in the CRO space, I guess, obviously, the big news of ICON and PRA Health Sciences, potentially merging. You commented, you're excited about your progress partnering, working with CROs, lot about there for you kind of any thoughts on the CRO landscape from Veeva perspective, given that merger is out there?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. That's certainly a large merger. And there's consolidation that can happen in the CRO space. So I think that's actually going to be good news for us. Both PRA and ICON are our customers, they have some of our products but not all of our products. I think as they get together and they look for more efficiency, they'll probably look to Veeva for more of our products. Now, that is a consolidation in the CRO industry. But there's also always specialized smaller CROs starting up in certain areas. So it's always -- there's both startups and consolidation happening. So I don't see a macro level change in this CRO industry.\nDonald Hooker: Interesting. Thank you. And then, maybe follow up question. Just was curious if you could update us on your Veeva consulting business. I know it's a little bit small and it doesn't get a lot of focus, but I just have a sense that a lot of these biopharma sponsors out there and particularly in the clinical area are struggling with wildly changing regulatory environment, the sort of the changing types of therapies coming to market and thinking about how to dovetail that with a lot of the new technologies, companies like Veeva are providing? I would imagine that's a nice growth area for you. Can you maybe talk about that even though it's small, are you -- and I think the business consulting is more commercial not granted, but is there opportunity to expand that into regulatory and clinical?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, it is a relatively small now and it is in commercial, we will bring that into the R&D area this year. And let me step back and talk about what the purpose of that it's really business process consulting, can we help customers optimize the business process, a lot of time that's related to our products, but it may not be always related to our products. And that brings a whole bunch of efficiency, because as you have new technology available, your processes need to change and customers need help with that. In the clinical side, and in the R&D side, particularly, what you're going to have is how do they optimize processes across the functional groups, the boundaries between quality and regulatory and clinical operations and clinical data and safety? How do they optimize those boundaries, given that new technology is available? Whereas in commercial, what you're doing is optimizing field execution within a region? How do you operate better in France? How do you operate better in the U.S.? So it takes a really different flavor. When we look at Veeva starting out in software and now we've really grown to lots of different software, but also data and business consulting. And that's, I think, the complete package. So it's very significant for Veeva overall.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Maybe first for you, Peter, some interesting commentary around the data cloud. Sounds like it's not only another option to customers, but actually potentially even better data, better quality data that is? And so the question is, can you just talk about what enables that potentially better quality of data and sort of broad brushes, how you envision the pricing on that offering down the road?\nPeter Gassner: I guess how it's better. First of all, we set out with the approach to innovate, the existing approach to the life sciences data is really big, it's really 20 years old, really and it really hasn't innovated, it hasn't had that competitive push to innovate. So we are taking a different approach to data sourcing, I won't get into the specifics of that, but definitely a different approach to data sourcing. And then we're focusing on longitudinal data, longitudinal patient data, longitudinal prescriber data and then our sales data. So if you look at it, historically, in the past, the industry has gotten used to the datasets they have, but we're bringing them new datasets with more complete coverage that can be used in better ways. So it's a very detailed work, but what we find is when data analysts get hold of this data, they think, wow, this is the way data should be done. Now, it's new. And so there's resistance to change. So it's almost like moving from client server to cloud. There's resistance to change, but we're really excited about the innovation.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. And Brent maybe the follow up for you. I think you mentioned this when you were talking about the guide, but you touched a little bit on potential some potential tweaks to sales compensation didn't sound like huge dollars, but curious if you could dig into kind of what those tweaks are kind of high level and just a recap on how that sort of impacting the expense dollars.\nBrent Bowman: Yes, certainly Saket, happy to. So we're not going to get into the nuances of the comp plan changes. But broadly, we're looking to align our goals and incentives as we do periodically to ensure they're aligned to customer success. And the changes we made enhances that alignment. The change did result in any substantial changes to our sales OTEs, but it did result in a higher amount of P&L expense in the fiscal year based on the accounting treatment. So, all in all, we think it's moved in the right direction to align for customer success.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Joe Vruwink of Baird.\nJoe Vruwink: Peter, I wanted to go back to your comments you made at the beginning about MyVeeva, but more broadly, just the rise in patient-centric clinical trials. And I understand it's a development that's still in the early innings. But if clinical practices do change and the virtual or hybrid becomes the new norm, how do you think Vault kind of develops or evolves over the next few years? And is it different, or are there certain opportunities that maybe or greater if we're truly embarking on this different way of clinical practices across the industry?\nPeter Gassner: Whether the trials are more decentralized or not, won't really affect the core vault or actually the clinical network. I do think, by the way, that is the approach that's going to happen, more decentralized clinical trials. But the really, where we can really help is more patient-centric and more paperless clinical trial. So, when you think about what we're trying to do when the patient -- when the doctor fills out from data after seeing the patient, whether that's virtual or in their office, we want them to be able to type that data into an electronic form, have that flow right back into the sponsor. That's actually not how it's done today. There's usually paper in the middle. So what we're doing is with our SiteVault product, providing software to the clinical research institutions for free, so that we can automate that whole process and we're really excited about it. I guess it's the biggest undertaking that Veeva has ever accomplished or we haven't accomplished yet. The biggest undertaking we've ever started because we're trying to automate processes across the patient, the clinical research and the life sciences industry. That's quite an undertaking.\nJoe Vruwink: And if I can ask one follow-up. Just more in regards to the near-term financial performance and specifically, the change from kind of the initial outlook on fiscal '22, last quarter and today's communication. Other than the update around commercial cloud and what you're seeing specifically for Engage, are there any other factors that drove the uplift in revenue expectations because it is a bit larger of a change than you typically have given between the initial and this quarter's update?\nBrent Bowman: Well, the good news in my answer is it's broad-based. So, we've seen good strength in demand and customer adoption across our development cloud suites. And as I said before, more broadly in commercial cloud outside of Engage. So, it is really a broad swath of strength that we're seeing that drove the increase in our guide.\nPeter Gassner: I guess it's a slight recognition that we're becoming a more strategic partner as time goes on with our customers. And that we feel that flows through to our business. We've proven ourselves more. We continue to prove ourselves more every quarter. And our product print grows broader and we're bringing in more senior executives into the company. So, that -- all those things will lead to broad-based business improvement.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan.\nSterling Auty: I'm kind of curious if you could give us maybe a bit of a descriptive update on the mix of the Vault revenue. And what I mean by that, maybe how much of that total bulk revenue is coming from clinical? I know there's a number of products versus just in pure R&D versus commercial, just all the different areas, how would you kind of split it up and describe the breakdown of Vault revenue today?\nBrent Bowman: Hi, Sterling, it's Brent. So, we don't break down the Vault revenue into major segments or at the product level. I think we've talked about the market opportunities in regarding the TAM. So, we've broken that $6 billion down, and we have a long runway across all of those segments. So across the clinical suite, regulatory, safety and quality, there's a lot of headroom in front of us and we're really pleased with the traction we're getting.\nPeter Gassner: And Sterling, not to break it down into specific numbers, but the largest revenue contributors in the Vault families are the commercial content. Now, that was the first place we got into, clinical operations and the quality. Those are the three largest. Our regulatory is good as well, but not quite as large. It has a longer tail on it. And then, the newer ones are the clinical data management and especially the safety. Those are very, very new. So that's roughly how to think of it.\nSterling Auty: Great. That's very helpful. And then, one follow-up would be, when you look at the business outside of life sciences, when you think about your longer-term aspirations there, is it all expected to be in that kind of safety and quality area, or how much of the opportunity might come from other additional solutions that you might be contemplating?\nPeter Gassner: At this time, when we talk about the 100 million, that's really in the quality and regulatory area. And that's what we have visibility into now and we're executing on. And, of course, there's always potential that we would -- maybe would do other things. But at this time, we have no plans we're not executing on anything other than quality and regulatory outside of life sciences. Safety will be used outside of life sciences but that's very early and none of that is contemplated in the 100 million.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Bhavan Suri of William Blair.\nDylan Becker: Hey, guys. This is Dylan on for Bhavan. Appreciate you taking our questions and we'll echo the congrats on a solid quarter. I guess a first question for me, I mean, maybe more toward Peter. Now, this a couple of quarters in from that initial CRO announcement, we added another kind of top CRO in CDMS. But how should we maybe be thinking of these partnerships as not only drivers of the overall CDMS adoption. I think you just kind of mentioned it on another, earlier question as well but the overall opportunity for these sponsors and CROs to expand their adoption across the clinical suite. Maybe as broader, kind of platform integration becomes more and more of a focal point on the clinical side?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. I think it's right to focus in on that. The six, seven, the top CROs. What it really indicates is, Veeva is becoming a core part of the fabric in the clinical data management area for life sciences. This integration with the service partners that the CROs is driven by interest from sponsors, large and small. So we couldn't be more excited about it, I tell you. And I think we'll innovate also with the CROs, right? When they see our type of technology, it will end up causing them to change their processes to further optimize and that's something that's going to help the industry overall. You have to remember that the existing products, the existing clinical data management products, the foundation of the two major players, those foundations were made roughly 20 years ago. And there's still, for example, not even those major players are not true cloud applications and how to upgrade to that automatically, they're not all on the same release. There's a lot of inefficiencies built into the system that we're kind of Veeva, I would say is a breath of fresh air for the clinical data management area.\nDylan Becker: Right. No, that's fantastic and it makes a lot of sense, especially within the rest of kind of the clinical suite being integrated as well there. Maybe one more, if I may or maybe more for Paul. But just kind of maybe given the uptake and it sounds like you guys are kind of investing in maybe the physicians world business with virtual webinars, online events, things like that. Just wanted to get a sense of maybe how you're positioning this business to take or to capitalize on that opportunity because I think maybe it's more of a checkbox initially when you acquired them, it seems like there's a growing and sizable opportunity there around kind of generating insights that was maybe greater than what you had initially expected when you acquired them 12 or 18 months back?\nPaul Shawah: Yes. That's exactly what's happening, the smaller part of the business when we acquired them and we've quickly pivoted the business since a lot of the physical events have been pretty much shut down in some markets, they're still happening or not, haven't gone to zero, but they've gone down pretty considerably. And what is growing very consistently across most markets are now digital events. And they're growing for good reason, not only because of the pandemic, but also beyond that. You think about the reach that you can get with a digital event where geography no longer is a barrier. Compliance is a little bit easier. The overall cost and spend on the event is less, because you're not bringing people together physically, let's say, a hotel or a restaurant. So, there are a lot of reasons that the industry has moved to more digital events and we pivoted the business to focus on that. And that has -- we're already starting to see some of the impact from doing that. And I think that will continue over the next couple of years. So when I think about the prospects in the event space, it's actually broadened our portfolio. We can now handle companies that do physical, that do virtual and what I think we'll see a mix of in the future is this concept of a hybrid event where they do some people are at a physical location and others are joining virtually. So it's really strengthened our overall positioning in that space.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Rishi Jaluria of D.A. Davidson.\nRishi Jaluria: Nice to see continued strong momentum in the business. Wanted to maybe go back first to the impressive CDMS traction that you're seeing. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color, especially on the CRO traction that you're seeing. Are these mostly displacing other solutions? Is it greenfield and then going after kind of a bunch of different point solutions that are stitched together? Any color you can give on where you're seeing that traction and what those customers are using in the first place would be helpful? And then I've got a follow-up.\nPeter Gassner: Sorry, I was on mute, you couldn't hear me. We're always displacing something. Now, it's often not a -- it's not a wholesale displacement. I will start with a study at a time. And generally, we will be displacing one of the top two large players there. They have most of the market. There are smaller, very regional players or localized players. That's not where we play too much. So we'd be replacing the top two. And as to why, it's a better EDC. So the study builds are faster with a more agile development environment and that's a huge reason. And then, the review, the basic of the data review process is a bit more streamlined and its true cloud. So, it's always upgraded. And then, we have a very good CTMS product and eTMF product. And especially, many of those CROs have our eTMF product and now increasingly some have our CTMS product. So, they're looking at getting the whole suite from Veeva that way, they don't have to maintain these troublesome integrations. They can have a smooth process flow because the CROs are all about efficiency. And they can get more efficient. It's the same reason why people get a suite of applications from SAP. When things are pre-integrated together, it's more efficient.\nRishi Jaluria: And then, I wanted to get maybe a little bit more color on the subscription net retention rate. I mean, really impressive to see it actually tick up and looks like it's at the highest level since FY '17. I was wondering if you can give a little bit of color on what drove that improvement from last year and then actually in the prior couple of years? And maybe how we should be thinking about that metric going forward?\nPaul Shawah: Yes. Let me give you just a qualitative view on that. Last year has been pretty remarkable from the standpoint as our customers have been put under significant pressure both on the development side, but also on the commercial side of the business. They've been forced to change and think differently about how they're operating. And we've been in a good position where we've established a foundation with most of these companies and we've helped them operate efficiently, maintain business continuity, operate more digitally, operate more virtually. When doctors' offices were closing down, when clinical research sites were closing down, we were there. I think that's showing up in the retention numbers that you're seeing. We are viewed as that as even a more strategic partner. It's created opportunity for us to shine even beyond the last couple of years. So in these challenging times, companies need a partner that can execute consistently and I think that's part of what you're seeing in that higher retention rate. I think the one last thing I'll add is, the broader vision that we talk about in each area, commercial cloud and development cloud, about bringing all of these process areas together. Companies are buying broadly into a development cloud vision. And then, what decisions they make after that become really easy. It's really a matter of how do they get to that? How do they grow into that development cloud over time? So it becomes more of a road mapping exercise than a vendor selection exercise.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler.\nBrent Bracelin: Maybe we'll start with Brent and finish with Peter here. Brent, Vault subscription in our model is now actually larger than commercial for the first time. And not only is this now the largest product but also saw accelerating growth. So as you just think about the demand drivers that drove this acceleration involved this quarter, you talked about broad-based, but was there any other factors that drove strength in Vault? And again, one quick follow-up for Peter.\nBrent Bowman: Yes. We saw, as people adopt products like eTMF and they look more broadly across the clinical suite, you're seeing that just further adoption, so buying into the integrated Vault platform. So a lot of strength in it. It is truly broad-based. We saw strength in CTMS. We saw strength in our quality suite and QMS as well. And so, it's really an exciting time with broad adoption across our product set. So customers are starting to go more all in, in the vault space.\nBrent Bracelin: Got it. So, it sounds like there's a little faster uptake of some of the add-ons there. I know there's, I think, 17, 18 Vault products. So good to hear. I guess, Peter, for you, I wanted to follow-up on the commentary you made around biotechs. You talked about seeing some biotechs have increasing interest in kind of going all-in on Veeva. My question is, what's the biggest benefit to the biotech? I mean, why are they coming to you, saying we want to go digital first? Is it just faster time-to-market? Is that the primary benefit that the biotechs want? Is it just a more efficient digital internal process? Help me understand why you're seeing that at the biotech level? And could this be a precursor to other firms wanting to go kind of all in and have a digital-first focus as well.\nPeter Gassner: So the concept of the biotech, so as a biotech they will be developing their drugs for many years using many, many millions of dollars to go through the clinical trials and then, they have to commercialize and that's a very, very critical time. It's a make or break time for the company. So that's the context when they -- some of them coming to us in the commercial cloud and wanting to go broadly in with Veeva. Now, why do they want that? A, they need somebody they can trust. They know digital is really important and they need a partner they can really trust. They've learned to trust Veeva. Many of them have been using us on the R&D side. And they have to do it right digitally. And so, this is kind of new. It's not the same way to do it. So, they're looking for a company that can put it all together for them. And I think our business consulting is critical in this. In fact, when they go all in with us, business consulting is basically a required part of that package, because you can't do that just with technology. You need the business process work to make that technology work for you. So it's critical for the biotech and they trust us and we have the complete package. That's why they would come to us. Otherwise, they have to be the general contractor. They might buy data from here and software from here and digital from there and content from here and get consulting from another place. That's more areas that could fall down if the company themselves has to be the general contractor. So, hey, how do you do that for us?\nBrent Bracelin: Certainly, helpful and explains why we're seeing certainly a big up tick in a number of job openings on the consulting side. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Peter, you're actually spending a lot of time with your customers talking through their own digital journey from a sales perspective. I was kind of curious about how you're thinking about your own go-to-market operations, not only in the coming year, but how are you thinking about making some changes? And then hopefully, when people can start getting on planes over the next few months or six months, are there any products that you think will be helped out by the fact that you can have people on site, talking to your customers in person again, or have you gotten to the point where you all can sell pretty much the whole portfolio virtually at a pretty effective level? I'm thinking about things like data, where these are big transformations that may be having those conversations in person might be helpful. So can you just walk through kind of anything you're changing this year and then anything that might be helped out maybe by moving past COVID?\nPeter Gassner: What we are changing this year is our summits, we have our customer summit. Those are always a key part of Veeva. We put the customers together. We would always do those in person, two-day event. Last year, we had to pivot very quickly to do those online and they went well, but I think we can do better. So, this year, we're looking at doing our virtual events even better. We're going to try out some new formats that we're really excited about. So that's one thing. And have the marketing and the customer engagement a little more continual. You've got to remember last year, we had to pivot so hard on our product model, our product road map and to support our customers and all their twists and turns. So, we were sort of hair on fire. This year, we're in a steady state, I think, with COVID and so we're going to optimize some of our marketing and sales processes. Now, in terms of getting back together, I don't think that will impact any one product more than any other product, but I do think that in-person interaction generally does help the speed of business. I think overall, business will be a little more ineffective over time if we don't get back together. Now, that won't just affect Veeva, I just think overall, that personal connection is needed. It provides people with energy and ideas and travel has a way of shaking you out of your norm. So I'm really looking forward to it, how about that? We didn\u2019t travel. When we can, we're going to get out there because you get used to this being not having that interaction and something is missed. So the whole Veeva team is, and our customers. We're looking to get back together again.\nOperator: And we have time for one final question from Stan Zlotsky of Morgan Stanley.\nStan Zlotsky: Congratulations on a very strong quarter. I actually wanted to come back to net revenue retention for a second, because I mean that was certainly an impressive result. Maybe help us unpack it a little bit. And how much of the up tick that we saw in net revenue retention to 124% in fiscal '21, was due to the \u2018like inorganic\u2019 or maybe onetime contribution from selling the Crossix product into the installed base, or maybe even in the Engage product, obviously, that's completely organic domain by you. But it was obviously a disproportionate benefit this year as well. How much of that was a driver of the up tick versus what's really sustainable going forward into fiscal '22 and beyond?\nBrent Bowman: Hey, Stan, it's Brent. So, currently Engage did contribute to that. But what I would say is development cloud more broadly also, was a big driver of that up tick as we continue to land and expand our offerings across our customer base. So, it was more than just a onetime pop. There was some substantial of attach and cross selling that happened in the development cloud space that helped drive that number.\nStan Zlotsky: Got it. That's helpful. And just maybe taking slightly reverse way to ask the question about the pharmaceutical headcount reductions. And as much as in Q3, you guys were talking to us about potential for a 10%-ish type of decline in global headcount in 2021. What happens if that decline is not 10%, right? I mean, what's baked into your billings guidance for fiscal '22? What happens to -- what kind of renewal base do you have baked in there? And are you truly baking in 10%, or is this something less than the 10% of the reductions you were talking about in Q3?\nPaul Shawah: Yes. So, we, in fact, are baking those reductions in and we bake them in over time because we don't see this as an abrupt change. We see it as a gradual change that will happen and over time, it will happen, we believe, over the next one to two years. Now, the impact on our financials will be somewhat muted because that will happen over a period of time. Maybe even a change that happens this fiscal year may not hit us until the next fiscal year. And I think a lot of that will be offset by strength that we're going to continue to have or anticipating having in CRM and in the add-ons in the broader commercial cloud portfolio. So we have, in fact, baked those reductions in. But again, most of what you see there is offset by some of the core commercial cloud strength.\nOperator: And we have no further questions. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters for any closing remarks.\nAto Garrett: All right. Thank you, everyone, for your time and we are looking forward to talking with many of you at the Morgan Stanley conference tomorrow and we're also looking forward to a great year ahead. Thank you.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you very much for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Peter. The fourth quarter was a great close to another year of outstanding execution for Veeva. We had record bookings in the quarter driven by our continued momentum across our development cloud product suites and Veeva CRM Engage. Development cloud performed extremely well with a record bookings quarter, including particular strength in CTMS and QMS. In commercial cloud core CRM and add on products over bookings performance in the quarter. Engage conversions were extremely strong and we believe captured roughly 60% of the total dollar opportunity. This will be a tailwind to our fiscal year \u201822 commercial cloud subscription revenue. We expect Engage subscription revenue growth after fiscal year \u201822 will be similar to other CRM add-ons. Crossix had a strong bookings quarter and posted 79 million in subscription revenue for the year. Total revenue for Crossix and physicians world was 103 million with physicians' world benefiting from growth and virtual events in the second half of the year. These acquired businesses are fully integrated into our financial results and will not break them out in the future. Strong subscription bookings including Engaged [earnings] [ph] and services demand lead to calculate billings of 688 million, which was 48 million above guidance. Total billings includes 15 million from changes and billing terms at a few large customers, which was 5 million above our previous expectation for Q4. Our revenue retention rate for the year was 124%. This metric is defined in the earnings release, and reflects annualized subscription revenue growth within existing customers net of revenue attrition and continues to illustrate the increasing value we are providing to our customers and the industries we serve. We had another strong quarter of hiring, we ended the quarter with 4506 employees and net gain of 202 from the previous quarter. For the year, we added more than 1000 net new employees, the vast majority of which were in our field and product development teams. Fourth quarter operating margin was 38.6%, which exceeded guidance. Operating margin was driven by subscription revenue outperformance and a smaller than expected seasonal dip in our professional services business. As a reminder, our operating margin includes roughly a 250 basis point benefit from cost savings related to lower travel and event expenses, which was in line with the previous quarter, Operating cash flow for fiscal year '21 excluding the excess tax benefit was 471 million, which was below our guidance. Approximately 30 million of expected Q4 collections push to Q1 and were collected in the quarter. I'll now provide guidance for the first quarter in fiscal year '22. For Q1, we expect total revenue between 408 million and 410 million, the subscription revenue of roughly 330 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter between 157 million and 159 million. This includes a benefit from reduced travel and events similar to the past three quarters. Note that we have made some changes to our fiscal year '22 sales compensation plan as we do from time-to-time. These changes have resulted in approximately 3 million in incremental expense in Q1 and approximately 11 million for the full year. Q1 non-GAAP EPS is projected to be $0.77 to $0.78 based on a diluted share count of approximately 162 million. Please note that we are maintaining our non-GAAP tax rate at 21% for fiscal year '22 and we'll monitor this assumption for significant events including any relevant tax law changes. We expect calculated billings of roughly 392 million in Q1, which implies year-over-year growth of about 17%. This reflects approximately 4 million of billings that moved into Q4 from Q1 related to the changes in billing terms we mentioned earlier. If we account for this dynamic, our normalized Q1 billings growth would be closer to 19%. Please remember that there are numerous factors that make year-over-year comparisons of this metric highly variable on a quarterly basis. Therefore, we do not believe quarterly billings growth is a good indicator of the underlying momentum of our business and we do not manage to it internally. Our subscription revenue guidance and calculated billings guidance for the full year are better indicators of our momentum. Turning toward guidance for the full fiscal year '22. We expect total revenue of $1.755 billion to $1.765 billion, a 45 million increase to the high-end of our prior guidance. Expect subscription revenue of approximately $1.430 billion consisting of Vault subscription revenue of roughly 750 million and commercial cloud of roughly 680 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income of about 655 million. Investing for growth is a priority for the year. Our guidance reflects investments with new data suppliers for our Data Cloud products and additional hiring primarily in our field and product development teams. We expect travel and event related expenses to start to increase in the back half of the year. We expect calculated billings of approximately $1.870 billion which reflects a 17% year-over-year growth rate. If we adjust for changes in customer billing terms in fiscal year '21, which totaled approximately 17 million, our guidance would imply normalized billings growth of roughly 18%. We expect about 42% of full year billings to be in Q4. We expect non-GAAP EPS for the full year of approximately $3.20 based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 163 million. Finally, we expect full year cash flow from operations, excluding the excess tax benefits of about 635 million. In closing, I'm very happy with our strong momentum exiting the fourth quarter and the growth we expect in the coming year. We are well positioned to achieve our 2025 target of 3 billion in revenue. Thanks for joining us today. And now I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Yes. Maybe I could add in, in the 13% growth that we guided to, we did see broad strength across the portfolio. So Crossix, core CRM and core CRM add-ons. We did have a pop in Engage. So that's probably the one item that would -- it flowed through our Q4 billings. And you'll see that flow through revenue through fiscal year '22. And then beyond that we expect Engage to grow more in line with other traditional add-ons. Yes. And we don't break out specific products in guiding and providing results. But with that a little texture. As we said in my prepared remarks, we gave you a sense of what we thought the dollar opportunity was that we had captured at 60%. The other piece of the equation is, we are trying to size that. So we've taught, if you think about sizing that we talked about percentage, of course, CRM. So we see that orienting around about 15%. So if you think about sizing that that's something to consider there. And the rest of our portfolio had outside of Engage how it would have a record commercial growth quarter bookings quarter. So we did have strength broadly outside of Engage. Yes, certainly Saket, happy to. So we're not going to get into the nuances of the comp plan changes. But broadly, we're looking to align our goals and incentives as we do periodically to ensure they're aligned to customer success. And the changes we made enhances that alignment. The change did result in any substantial changes to our sales OTEs, but it did result in a higher amount of P&L expense in the fiscal year based on the accounting treatment. So, all in all, we think it's moved in the right direction to align for customer success. Well, the good news in my answer is it's broad-based. So, we've seen good strength in demand and customer adoption across our development cloud suites. And as I said before, more broadly in commercial cloud outside of Engage. So, it is really a broad swath of strength that we're seeing that drove the increase in our guide. Hi, Sterling, it's Brent. So, we don't break down the Vault revenue into major segments or at the product level. I think we've talked about the market opportunities in regarding the TAM. So, we've broken that $6 billion down, and we have a long runway across all of those segments. So across the clinical suite, regulatory, safety and quality, there's a lot of headroom in front of us and we're really pleased with the traction we're getting. Yes. We saw, as people adopt products like eTMF and they look more broadly across the clinical suite, you're seeing that just further adoption, so buying into the integrated Vault platform. So a lot of strength in it. It is truly broad-based. We saw strength in CTMS. We saw strength in our quality suite and QMS as well. And so, it's really an exciting time with broad adoption across our product set. So customers are starting to go more all in, in the vault space. Hey, Stan, it's Brent. So, currently Engage did contribute to that. But what I would say is development cloud more broadly also, was a big driver of that up tick as we continue to land and expand our offerings across our customer base. So, it was more than just a onetime pop. There was some substantial of attach and cross selling that happened in the development cloud space that helped drive that number."

            "name": "Peter Gassner",
            "content": "Thank you, Ato. So first, I'd like to thank our life sciences customers for their incredible efforts over the last year. The COVID-19 genome was only sequenced about a year ago, and we now already have safe and effective vaccines, diagnostics and therapies. That's just amazing speed. COVID-19 was also disruptive to the healthcare systems overall, and the industry really stepped up to support doctors and patients around the world. 2020 was a transformational year for Life Sciences and to Veeva. The scale and speed of innovation from the Veeva team enabled the industry to adapt quickly and work in new ways. Thanks to the team for your outstanding execution against our important mission. Turning to our results, Veeva delivered exceptional performance for the quarter and year, total revenue was 397 million up 27% year over year. Subscription revenue also grew 27% year over year, and non-GAAP operating margin was 39%. Our full fiscal year revenue was 1.46 billion up 33% year-over-year and subscription revenue was $1.18 billion up 32% year-over-year. In commercial we further extended our leadership position with commercial cloud customer growth and the development of important new products that will set us up for future growth over the long-term. In Q4, we had 17 new customer wins for core CRM and a number of international expansions with existing enterprise accounts. It was also a standout quarter for Veeva CRM Engage as customers move to paid subscriptions at the end of the 2023 period. We are pleased with the adoption of Engage and expect high attach rates with new customers as they look to digital capabilities to drive field efficiency. I'm also very pleased with the progress in Veeva Data Cloud. In Q4, we released patient data for the U.S. and now have five early adopter customers. We are also [preparing] [ph] our data with other customers and the feedback is encouraging. In multiple cases, we were able to identify patients and prescribers that were not available in their existing datasets. Looking ahead, we expect to have prescribers and sales data available for the U.S. by the end of the year, offering for additional countries will come over time. It's early days, but we're excited by the potential of Veeva Data Cloud to help the industry in an area that's been stagnant for too long. Having great data, software and business consulting is allowing us to build deeper partnerships with the industry. We're starting to see increasing interest among biotechs to go all in with Veeva partnering with us from the very start to define and operationalize the digital first commercial strategy. In Q4, we had a second biotech in the U.S. go all in with us in this way. To put the breadth of our full offering in context, core CRM is roughly 20% of the opportunity, when a customer goes all in with commercial cloud in the U.S. There's a major long-term potential for Veeva in commercial if we execute well on our vision. This year, our focus is to continue to innovate in our products and optimize our delivery and support for this approach by partnering deeply with a handful of early adopters. As we look back on the year, I'd also like to share the two acquisitions we made about 18 months ago, Crossix and physicians world are integrated and operating well. We further invested in Crossix growing the team by more than 50% since acquisition. The growth is mostly in the data science area as we expand the Crossix data platform. Our event services business that was physicians world made a quick pivot when the pandemic hit and has been helping lead the industry in digital events. We expect these new businesses to continue to thrive, growing roughly in line with Veeva overall in the year ahead. On the R&D side, we had another great quarter across the board with wins and go lives in clinical, quality, regulatory and safety. The industry is starting to really appreciate the power of vault development cloud to streamline drug development end-to-end. We closed the year with more than 850 vault customers overall, quality and regulatory had a record number of wins in the year, the Vault RIM and Vault Quality suites are adding significant value to the industry as they are the only offerings that can truly unify these important functions. It was also a big year for clinical. One major milestone was involved CDMS, in 2016, we set out to build a better EDC, the first product in CDMS and we believe we are now there. While EDC allows customers to build and execute studies more quickly than before and get access to crucial trial data faster. The impact on a customer's trial speed and agility has been significant and the industry is starting to take notice. In fact, we just announced that six of the top seven CROs have joined the Vault CDMS Partner Program, which is further validation of the strength of Vault CDMS. Having a critical mass of CRO partners will make it easier for smaller customers to use Vault CDMS because they often leverage the technology provided by their CRO partner. We have also made excellent progress with Veeva clinical network to connect site, patients and sponsors. This is a bold vision for the industry that over time has the potential to make trials 25% faster at 25% less cost. It's still early days for clinical network, but we have the key building blocks in place. We have seven customers signed up and the first few customers just went live with their first site on Site Connect, which is our first clinical network application. Site Connect link sponsors and the clinical research sites together to make study startup and study execution faster and more compliant. MyVeeva for patients is another important part of the clinical network. The first application in MyVeeva for patients is eConsent. And we're already working with a few early adopters. In fact, we had our very first patient use MyVeeva to sign an electronic consent form last Friday. That's a big milestone for clinical network. We're really excited about having patients use Veeva applications directly. Overall, it's been great to see so much progress, innovation and exceptional execution across the board in commercial and R&D. Looking outside of Life Sciences, we had another solid quarter with new customer wins and expansions in consumer goods and chemicals. In Q4, a top 20 nutrition company selected RegulatoryOne. Despite COVID related disruption and a significant downturn in the cosmetics industry. They had a good year overall outside of Life Sciences with revenue over 30 million as expected. Before we close, I wanted to share that in February Veeva officially became a public benefit corporation. Our proposal passed by an overwhelming majority vote. Thank you to our shareholders for your support in this important decision. This move was about the future of Veeva over the decades to come and ensuring the company continues to operate in consideration of all stakeholders. But we are also seeing a positive effect right now in attracting talent to Veeva and in deepening our customer relationships. I also posted a medium article with my personal perspective on the importance of public benefit corporations more broadly. In all, it was a year of exceptional innovation and execution across the board. We're in a stronger position than ever with the right team, customers, products and vision to fuel our growth to 2025 and beyond. I'll now turn it over to Brent to discuss the details of our financial performance. Ken, thanks for the excellent question. For customers, it's helping. It's a discussion starter. And it also is a very concrete way to say what Veeva is all about not just because we're saying it, because we wrote it in our charter that we're committed to the industry, to society and to our employees, not just to our shareholders. So they can depend on Veeva long-term and it's absolutely helping. It's also helping in recruiting. We have people, a number of people seeking us out and they want to be part of that. So I wouldn't say there's an unexpected, also thing that that's happening, I think it's helping us generate new ideas. It's exposing us to a different ecosystem of ideas that will be positive for Veeva in the long-term. In terms of other companies, certainly I've had reached out from others and they're interested in it. I think rightfully so this is a board decision the PBC matter. So this is something that plays out over years really this is not a snap decision and it may be right for other companies the PBCs and it may not be right for them. So I try to stay neutral on that and just provide whatever advice and guidance I can about how it fits for Veeva. So why don't I take the first part about the headcount reductions? And then, I'll let Brent, answer your question about billings and impact on the financials. So from a headcount perspective, we first talked about that last quarter. So we know a little bit more now, we said we believed it was about a 10% reduction that'll happen about over the next year or so, we still think that's going to happen, we think it'll happen likely over the next one to two years. But, so far, we haven't seen the reductions happen broadly, across the industry haven't been industry wide reductions that we've seen in Q4. There's always ups and downs, it's a little bit up and a little bit down as companies shift. But there has not yet been anything that's been unusual or out of the ordinary. Now, having said that, why do we still believe it's going to happen? The context is important here that the industry has moved to digital. We helped the industry become more digital, you heard that in Brent's prepared remarks, we have now, about 60% of market share from an Engaged standpoint, the industry is using that that will make the industry more efficient, it will make them more effective and productive. They now have the opportunity to apply those efficiency gains to either reach more customers or to have reductions in the field force. And I think pharma is thinking about, what's, how do they optimize for that and that takes time. So we haven't seen the impact yet. But I do think that will play out. And we have included those reductions in that thinking within our guidance as well. Yes. So you're right, 60% is the -- of the total Engage opportunity. So as we think it's not as a percentage of the CRM seats that we have, it's what the total market for Engage. So, that happened, relatively quickly over the course of the last year, we knew we were there for the industry with the right products and technology and expertise to move the industry quickly. We'll see that impact hit our revenue, as Brent mentioned, largely this fiscal year. And then beyond that, you will see it grow more like a steady growing add-on. So most of the pop that we have seen has already hit in this current year. And then, beyond that, I think it'll see steady growth. And it may approach some of the cash rate to what we talked about with close to marketing and with approved email, which are a bit higher than where we're at with 60%. Yes, thanks. I can cover that also. So, yes, you're right. I mean, last quarter, we had 19 CRM wins, that was a record. This quarter, we had 17 CRM wins. As we look across those there, many of them are pre-commercial companies, a lot of them in the U.S. market. We are also seeing wins in Europe, but then even in some of the domestic markets, like in Brazil and in Japan. So, we're pleased with that we're winning most deals in terms of, the overall competitive landscape, we're gaining share, we've gained share, quarter-over-quarter, we've gained share year-over-year. And there's a reason for that the reason we're gaining shares, because particularly in really difficult times, like we're operating in companies are looking for a partner they can trust, they want a partner that can execute. This is all about execution, right, you have a field people that need to be productive in the field, they need a partner that they can trust. They also want a partner that can innovate with them and we've proven that. And they're also looking for somebody who has the domain expertise and the guidance to get them through to digital transformation. And that's what we've been doing over the last year. So from a competitive standpoint, our position has actually improved over the last year because it's really shined a light on the difference between how Veeva is operating and how rest of the -- others or other alternatives in the market appear. So really happy with progress from a competitive standpoint. Thanks, Brad. Yes, in terms of my comments there about the 20% of the opportunity, really referring to when we sell our complete commercial products that we have today, not talking about future products, but products that we have today in the U.S. market, when we sell that to a small biotech, when they go all in with us, the core CRM is about 20% of the opportunity today. So that the other 80% of that opportunity comes from the breadth of our products. Some of it is from the commercial content, there's a pretty good size chunk from data cloud and that chunk will grow Crossix is a sizable area that will grow. And then, we have the CRM add-ons and we also have Nitro. So when we look for this complete commercial, which we have today, in certain markets, like in the U.S., now its very early days, but we haven't, that's where the opportunity comes from. So we've come a really long way from the days where we just had CRM, now we have a long tail with the data and analytics products being the largest areas. Yes, outside Life Sciences, we're focused on the consumer packaged goods, chemicals, and also cosmetics, although cosmetics has had a tough year here with the pandemic. And in that we're focused on the quality and the regulatory areas. So the market is of a certain size to put it in reference, it's about similar to our CDMS market size. And what I would consider it's a relatively slow and steady mover. So we're happy, we're deepening our customer engagements. But these are areas that don't move too fast. So to give the guidance on that, we have said before, we would like to have about $100 million business there in that segment of the market by 2025 and we're still on track for that. So things are going according to plan there outside Life Sciences. Yes, Tom, very, I consider that very significant six as a top seven CROs supporting Veeva in our partnership program, every one of the top seven CROs except for Quintiles. And that's significant, because that means that's what customers are asking for. CROs are very efficient, they focus on getting the work done. They don't want to lead into technology when customers aren't asking for it. So this means the customers are asking for this technology. And it means the CROs feel that they can be very efficient with Veeva. And over time now that takes a year or two to really work its way into the mid market ecosystem. But we're very bullish on that. I expect us to be the leader in the clinical data management market by roughly in the 2025 timeframe. It's a market that life sciences is cautious on and conservative, but we have the better product and I'm very pleased with our early adopter success with our customers. So I couldn't be happier. We entered that market in 2016 wrote the first line of code. And now we're set for leadership. So very enthused about that area. Yes. That's certainly a large merger. And there's consolidation that can happen in the CRO space. So I think that's actually going to be good news for us. Both PRA and ICON are our customers, they have some of our products but not all of our products. I think as they get together and they look for more efficiency, they'll probably look to Veeva for more of our products. Now, that is a consolidation in the CRO industry. But there's also always specialized smaller CROs starting up in certain areas. So it's always -- there's both startups and consolidation happening. So I don't see a macro level change in this CRO industry. Yes, it is a relatively small now and it is in commercial, we will bring that into the R&D area this year. And let me step back and talk about what the purpose of that it's really business process consulting, can we help customers optimize the business process, a lot of time that's related to our products, but it may not be always related to our products. And that brings a whole bunch of efficiency, because as you have new technology available, your processes need to change and customers need help with that. In the clinical side, and in the R&D side, particularly, what you're going to have is how do they optimize processes across the functional groups, the boundaries between quality and regulatory and clinical operations and clinical data and safety? How do they optimize those boundaries, given that new technology is available? Whereas in commercial, what you're doing is optimizing field execution within a region? How do you operate better in France? How do you operate better in the U.S.? So it takes a really different flavor. When we look at Veeva starting out in software and now we've really grown to lots of different software, but also data and business consulting. And that's, I think, the complete package. So it's very significant for Veeva overall. I guess how it's better. First of all, we set out with the approach to innovate, the existing approach to the life sciences data is really big, it's really 20 years old, really and it really hasn't innovated, it hasn't had that competitive push to innovate. So we are taking a different approach to data sourcing, I won't get into the specifics of that, but definitely a different approach to data sourcing. And then we're focusing on longitudinal data, longitudinal patient data, longitudinal prescriber data and then our sales data. So if you look at it, historically, in the past, the industry has gotten used to the datasets they have, but we're bringing them new datasets with more complete coverage that can be used in better ways. So it's a very detailed work, but what we find is when data analysts get hold of this data, they think, wow, this is the way data should be done. Now, it's new. And so there's resistance to change. So it's almost like moving from client server to cloud. There's resistance to change, but we're really excited about the innovation. Whether the trials are more decentralized or not, won't really affect the core vault or actually the clinical network. I do think, by the way, that is the approach that's going to happen, more decentralized clinical trials. But the really, where we can really help is more patient-centric and more paperless clinical trial. So, when you think about what we're trying to do when the patient -- when the doctor fills out from data after seeing the patient, whether that's virtual or in their office, we want them to be able to type that data into an electronic form, have that flow right back into the sponsor. That's actually not how it's done today. There's usually paper in the middle. So what we're doing is with our SiteVault product, providing software to the clinical research institutions for free, so that we can automate that whole process and we're really excited about it. I guess it's the biggest undertaking that Veeva has ever accomplished or we haven't accomplished yet. The biggest undertaking we've ever started because we're trying to automate processes across the patient, the clinical research and the life sciences industry. That's quite an undertaking. I guess it's a slight recognition that we're becoming a more strategic partner as time goes on with our customers. And that we feel that flows through to our business. We've proven ourselves more. We continue to prove ourselves more every quarter. And our product print grows broader and we're bringing in more senior executives into the company. So, that -- all those things will lead to broad-based business improvement. And Sterling, not to break it down into specific numbers, but the largest revenue contributors in the Vault families are the commercial content. Now, that was the first place we got into, clinical operations and the quality. Those are the three largest. Our regulatory is good as well, but not quite as large. It has a longer tail on it. And then, the newer ones are the clinical data management and especially the safety. Those are very, very new. So that's roughly how to think of it. At this time, when we talk about the 100 million, that's really in the quality and regulatory area. And that's what we have visibility into now and we're executing on. And, of course, there's always potential that we would -- maybe would do other things. But at this time, we have no plans we're not executing on anything other than quality and regulatory outside of life sciences. Safety will be used outside of life sciences but that's very early and none of that is contemplated in the 100 million. Yes. I think it's right to focus in on that. The six, seven, the top CROs. What it really indicates is, Veeva is becoming a core part of the fabric in the clinical data management area for life sciences. This integration with the service partners that the CROs is driven by interest from sponsors, large and small. So we couldn't be more excited about it, I tell you. And I think we'll innovate also with the CROs, right? When they see our type of technology, it will end up causing them to change their processes to further optimize and that's something that's going to help the industry overall. You have to remember that the existing products, the existing clinical data management products, the foundation of the two major players, those foundations were made roughly 20 years ago. And there's still, for example, not even those major players are not true cloud applications and how to upgrade to that automatically, they're not all on the same release. There's a lot of inefficiencies built into the system that we're kind of Veeva, I would say is a breath of fresh air for the clinical data management area. Sorry, I was on mute, you couldn't hear me. We're always displacing something. Now, it's often not a -- it's not a wholesale displacement. I will start with a study at a time. And generally, we will be displacing one of the top two large players there. They have most of the market. There are smaller, very regional players or localized players. That's not where we play too much. So we'd be replacing the top two. And as to why, it's a better EDC. So the study builds are faster with a more agile development environment and that's a huge reason. And then, the review, the basic of the data review process is a bit more streamlined and its true cloud. So, it's always upgraded. And then, we have a very good CTMS product and eTMF product. And especially, many of those CROs have our eTMF product and now increasingly some have our CTMS product. So, they're looking at getting the whole suite from Veeva that way, they don't have to maintain these troublesome integrations. They can have a smooth process flow because the CROs are all about efficiency. And they can get more efficient. It's the same reason why people get a suite of applications from SAP. When things are pre-integrated together, it's more efficient. So the concept of the biotech, so as a biotech they will be developing their drugs for many years using many, many millions of dollars to go through the clinical trials and then, they have to commercialize and that's a very, very critical time. It's a make or break time for the company. So that's the context when they -- some of them coming to us in the commercial cloud and wanting to go broadly in with Veeva. Now, why do they want that? A, they need somebody they can trust. They know digital is really important and they need a partner they can really trust. They've learned to trust Veeva. Many of them have been using us on the R&D side. And they have to do it right digitally. And so, this is kind of new. It's not the same way to do it. So, they're looking for a company that can put it all together for them. And I think our business consulting is critical in this. In fact, when they go all in with us, business consulting is basically a required part of that package, because you can't do that just with technology. You need the business process work to make that technology work for you. So it's critical for the biotech and they trust us and we have the complete package. That's why they would come to us. Otherwise, they have to be the general contractor. They might buy data from here and software from here and digital from there and content from here and get consulting from another place. That's more areas that could fall down if the company themselves has to be the general contractor. So, hey, how do you do that for us? What we are changing this year is our summits, we have our customer summit. Those are always a key part of Veeva. We put the customers together. We would always do those in person, two-day event. Last year, we had to pivot very quickly to do those online and they went well, but I think we can do better. So, this year, we're looking at doing our virtual events even better. We're going to try out some new formats that we're really excited about. So that's one thing. And have the marketing and the customer engagement a little more continual. You've got to remember last year, we had to pivot so hard on our product model, our product road map and to support our customers and all their twists and turns. So, we were sort of hair on fire. This year, we're in a steady state, I think, with COVID and so we're going to optimize some of our marketing and sales processes. Now, in terms of getting back together, I don't think that will impact any one product more than any other product, but I do think that in-person interaction generally does help the speed of business. I think overall, business will be a little more ineffective over time if we don't get back together. Now, that won't just affect Veeva, I just think overall, that personal connection is needed. It provides people with energy and ideas and travel has a way of shaking you out of your norm. So I'm really looking forward to it, how about that? We didn't travel. When we can, we're going to get out there because you get used to this being not having that interaction and something is missed. So the whole Veeva team is, and our customers. We're looking to get back together again."

            "name": "Paul Shawah",
            "content": "Yes. That's exactly what's happening, the smaller part of the business when we acquired them and we've quickly pivoted the business since a lot of the physical events have been pretty much shut down in some markets, they're still happening or not, haven't gone to zero, but they've gone down pretty considerably. And what is growing very consistently across most markets are now digital events. And they're growing for good reason, not only because of the pandemic, but also beyond that. You think about the reach that you can get with a digital event where geography no longer is a barrier. Compliance is a little bit easier. The overall cost and spend on the event is less, because you're not bringing people together physically, let's say, a hotel or a restaurant. So, there are a lot of reasons that the industry has moved to more digital events and we pivoted the business to focus on that. And that has -- we're already starting to see some of the impact from doing that. And I think that will continue over the next couple of years. So when I think about the prospects in the event space, it's actually broadened our portfolio. We can now handle companies that do physical, that do virtual and what I think we'll see a mix of in the future is this concept of a hybrid event where they do some people are at a physical location and others are joining virtually. So it's really strengthened our overall positioning in that space. Yes. Let me give you just a qualitative view on that. Last year has been pretty remarkable from the standpoint as our customers have been put under significant pressure both on the development side, but also on the commercial side of the business. They've been forced to change and think differently about how they're operating. And we've been in a good position where we've established a foundation with most of these companies and we've helped them operate efficiently, maintain business continuity, operate more digitally, operate more virtually. When doctors' offices were closing down, when clinical research sites were closing down, we were there. I think that's showing up in the retention numbers that you're seeing. We are viewed as that as even a more strategic partner. It's created opportunity for us to shine even beyond the last couple of years. So in these challenging times, companies need a partner that can execute consistently and I think that's part of what you're seeing in that higher retention rate. I think the one last thing I'll add is, the broader vision that we talk about in each area, commercial cloud and development cloud, about bringing all of these process areas together. Companies are buying broadly into a development cloud vision. And then, what decisions they make after that become really easy. It's really a matter of how do they get to that? How do they grow into that development cloud over time? So it becomes more of a road mapping exercise than a vendor selection exercise. Yes. So, we, in fact, are baking those reductions in and we bake them in over time because we don't see this as an abrupt change. We see it as a gradual change that will happen and over time, it will happen, we believe, over the next one to two years. Now, the impact on our financials will be somewhat muted because that will happen over a period of time. Maybe even a change that happens this fiscal year may not hit us until the next fiscal year. And I think a lot of that will be offset by strength that we're going to continue to have or anticipating having in CRM and in the add-ons in the broader commercial cloud portfolio. So we have, in fact, baked those reductions in. But again, most of what you see there is offset by some of the core commercial cloud strength."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ato Garrett, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Thank you, and please go ahead.\nAto Garrett: Good afternoon, and welcome to Veeva's fiscal 2021 third quarter earnings call for the quarter ended October 31, 2020. With me on today's call are Peter Gassner, our Chief Executive Officer; Paul Shawah, EVP, Strategy; and Brent Bowman, our Chief Financial Officer. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding trends, our strategies, and the anticipated performance of the business. These forward-looking statements will be based on management's current views and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those related to the impacts of COVID-19 on our business, the life sciences industry, and global economic conditions. Our actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the risks listed in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our most recent filing on Form 10-Q, which is available on the company's Web site at www.veeva.com under the Investors section, and on the SEC Web site at www.sec.gov. Forward-looking statements made during the call today are being made as of today, December 1, 2020, based on the facts available to us today. If this call is replayed or viewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Veeva disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today's call, but we'll not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. The guidance we will provide today is in part based on our current assumptions as to the macroeconomic environment in which we will be operating in the future, including the timing and pace of recovery from any negative effects caused by COVID-19. Such matters that are beyond our control and our assumptions may not be correct and may change rapidly. On the call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today's earnings release and in the supplemental investor presentation, both of which are available on our Web site. A reconciliation can also be found as an exhibit to the Form 8-K filed with the SEC just before this call. With that, thank you for joining us, and I'll turn it over to Peter.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you, Ato. Before we get started, I'd like to extend our sympathies to everyone affected by the pandemic, and our gratitude to all those working to help in so many ways, including our customers. The industry has produced effective vaccine candidates, rapid diagnostics, and approved treatments, all in a matter of months. We are proud to be working with these amazing companies, and I'm proud of how the Veeva team has stepped up to help. Now, turning to Q3. We had another quarter of consistent execution and results ahead of guidance. Total revenue was $378 million, up 34% year-over-year. Subscription revenue also grew 34% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating margin was 41%. We are pleased with our results and how we're expanding customer relationships during a major digital transformation. We've been able to help customers with immediate needs to open up digital channels in commercial and clinical, and we're also helping them to find the right digital models for the long-term. For example, on the commercial side, we recently announced the strategic partnership with an emerging biopharma to help them define and execute an innovative digital-first commercial model. They will utilize the full commercial cloud, including Veeva CRM, Data Cloud, Veeva Link, MyVeeva, and Business Consulting. That level of trust and confidence in our ability to deliver came through strongly in our Q3 new wins and expansions. We added 19 new CRM customers, our biggest quarterly increase yet. We continue to grow market share and had multiple international expansions in CRM with existing customers. We also progressed well in our newer areas, including Data Cloud, MyVeeva for Doctors, and Veeva Link. We expect these products will set us up for a long runway of growth in commercial. It's an exciting time in commercial and a time of change. We think our customers can generate meaningful productivity gains over the coming years as they increasingly leverage digital. We're excited to enable that transformation through our technology. With Veeva Vault, we've seen significant progress in Development Cloud adoption. Customers are increasingly purchasing multiple products at once, including our recently announced top five pharma, who selected Veeva Vault products in clinical operations, quality, and regulatory. This is a major transformation, which they will implement over the next two to three years. We're also seeing more customers expand Vault usage within each area of Development Cloud. In clinical operations, Vault CTMS had a standout quarter. We now have more than 75 customers, including six of the top 20 that have chosen to standardize on Vault CTMS. This is a remarkable pace of adoption, given the product was launched just over three years ago. This rapid uptake is based on the trust we've built in clinical operations with Vault eTMF, and the power of having a unified suite for clinical operations. In the area of clinical I am particularly excited about is Veeva Clinical Network, where we're bringing real innovation to the industry to help advance the move to paperless and patient-centric clinical trials. Clinical Network connects sponsors, sites, and patients, and has the potential to fundamentally change how the industry conducts trials. We announced our first Clinical Network application, Veeva Site Connect, to connect sites and sponsors, and in Q3 closed our first top 20 customer for Site Connect. In Quality, we had 20 net new customers select Vault QualityDocs, and we now have 12 of the top 20 pharmas as QualityDocs customers. Safety also continues to progress well with our early adopters, and we added four new customers. We also started our first Safety AI project in the quarter. Outside of life sciences, as the pandemic continues to drive changes in consumer goods and cosmetics, companies are looking to us for agile global solutions that can help them quickly adapt. This dynamic drove a major win in Q3 with another large CPG customer. We also brought together nearly 800 liters from across consumer goods, cosmetics, and chemicals for an Online Quality and Regulatory Summit to share best practices and insights. Overall, we are pleased with our growing reach and momentum in these industries. Now, I'll share some additional thoughts as we look ahead to next year. On the Commercial Cloud side of the business, customers will find new ways to be more efficient by adopting our digital solutions. We believe this will likely drive field force reductions in the neighborhood of 10% over the coming year. At the same time, we expect to increase market share in CRM and see further adoption of CRM add-on products such as Engage, Events, and Align. We also expect greater adoption for Veeva Link, and it will be an important early adopter year for Data Cloud and MyVeeva. We expect Vault to continue its strong growth, particularly Development Cloud, with progress across the Board in clinical, quality, and regulatory. It's still early in terms of revenue for CDMS and Safety, but we have very strong early adopter momentum and broad customer interest, which will serve us well in these large markets in the coming years. We're also excited about the future of Clinical Network, and we expect another year of consistent growth outside of life sciences in CPG, chemicals, and cosmetics. And finally, I'd like to update you on our proposed conversion to a public benefit corporation. We have completed our communication process with customers and investors, and the feedback has been largely positive. We also completed the comment process with the SEC and are filing a revised proxy this week. We will hold a special shareholder meeting to vote on the proposed PBC conversion on January 13. In closing, I'd like to say how proud I am of the Veeva team for the exceptional teamwork, flexibility, innovation, and execution throughout the year. It's that combination of trust, great people, and great products that has put us in a position to really help the industry during this time of change. Now, I'll turn it over to Brent for a financial update.\nBrent Bowman: Thanks, Peter. Q3 was a quarter of very strong execution. Bookings and services performance were both better than expected, with notable acceleration in Development Cloud applications like CTMS and QMS that are early in the reference selling cycle. This led to outperformance in both subscription and services revenue. This strong demand in bookings and services also led to a calculated billings total that was $26 million above our guidance for the quarter. Billings also benefited from better than expected billing duration for the business closed in Q3. Hiring performance in Q3 was also especially strong. We ended the quarter with 4,304 employees, a net increase of 280 from Q2. Much of this increase in headcount was within our Vault services teams and in our product teams, especially those product teams working on newer applications like CDMS safety, Data Cloud, and MyVeeva. Q3 operating margin benefited from roughly 250 basis points of pandemic-related cost savings from reduced travel and customer events that have moved to virtual, a level similar to the previous quarter. We anticipate a comparable benefit to operating margins in Q4 and into the beginning of next year. Turning to guidance for the fourth quarter, total revenue is expected to be $378 million to $380 million with subscription revenue of roughly $315 million and services revenue of $63 million to $65 million. Note that this implies a sequential drop in services revenue of about $10 million to $12 million from the third quarter, while our services business always has a high degree of variability. There are a couple of reasons for the size of this change. The biggest factor is our normal seasonal pattern resulting from fewer billable days around the holidays and our field kickoff. Our digital events business also has a similar seasonal pattern with fewer events around the holiday. Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter is expected to be $136 million to $138 million, a non-GAAP operating margin of about 36%. Note that while Q4 is typically a seedling lower margin quarter, this year, we expect incremental expenses related to additional data supplier contracts as we invest in our Data Cloud product. These expenses will appear in our costs of subscription services revenue line. We will also continue to aggressively hire as we scale to meet near-term demand and plant seeds for longer term growth. Q4 non-GAAP EPS is projected to be $0.67 to $0.68 based on diluted share count of approximately $162.5 million. We anticipate calculated billings of roughly $640 million in Q4. That this includes a benefit of about $10 million related to one large customer we expect to switch from quarterly to annual billing term. Please remember, that there are numerous factors that make year-over-year comparisons of this metric highly variable on a quarterly basis. Therefore we do not believe quarterly billings grow is a good indicator of the underlying momentum of our business, and we do not manage to it internally. Our subscription revenue guidance and calculated billings guidance for the full-year are the best indicators of our momentum. All of these Q4 guidance metrics imply the following numbers for the full-year. Total revenue of $1.446 billion to $1.448 billion, Subscription revenue of about $1.172 billion, non-GAAP operating income of $566 million to $568 million, and calculate billings of about 1,550 million. We now project non-GAAP EPS for the full-year of $2.83 to $2.84 based on a fully diluted share count of approximately $161 million. Note that within subscription revenue, we expect commercial cloud to finish the year at about $595 million and Vaults come in at about $577 million. We now expect prospects to contribute $78 million to $80 million within subscription revenue. This is up $2 million from our previous estimate and that business has benefited from the gradual rebound of advertising spend within life sciences companies. Within the total revenue line, we now expect to combine contribution from book Crossix and positioned world to represent $97 million to $100 million for the full-year. Finally, we are also raising our guidance for the full-year cash flow from operations, excluding the excess tax benefit to $500 million, up from $475 million previously, based primarily on billings outperformance in Q3. Before I close, let me give an initial outlook for fiscal 2022. Please note that we are still in the process of finalizing the plan and we'll provide a formal guidance on the Q4 earnings call. Currently, our initial outlook for next year is for total revenue of $1.700 billion to $1.720 billion. Within that guide, we expect subscription revenue of roughly $1.390 billion to $1.400 billion. We will provide more specific guidance on the next earnings call, including breakdowns of Commercial Cloud and Vault. Overall, the life science industry remains healthy, and continues to invest for the future, which gives us confidence in this early guide for next year. Based on our early spinning plans, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of roughly 37% for the full-year. This would represent a compression of about 200 basis points from fiscal '21, which is driven primarily by three things. First, we plan to continue investing in our Data Cloud product through additional data supplier relationships. Second, we're assuming that travel and event-related expenses will start to return at some point next year. Lastly, we plan to continue hiring aggressively for customer success and product innovation. With that, let me close by saying that I'm extremely pleased with the results in the quarter, and I'm very excited for the foundation we've laid for next year. The team's outstanding and consistent performance gives me confidence in our ability to achieve our target of $3 billion in total revenue in calendar 2025. Thanks for joining us today. And now, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Your line is open.\nBhavan Suri: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and really nice job there. Maybe Peter, we'll start with you. We've now seen sort of a handful of vaccine candidates come to market and hopefully have them broadly disseminated over the next several months. I guess, as that's happened, I'd love to know if you are seeing how the appetite from existing potential customers might have shifted or has it shifted to sort of think about transforming the clinical technology as the platform, so sort of the idea that we want to adopt all of the Veeva platform. You mentioned one customer who had chosen to do that. But I'd like to just sort of understand sort of even within the existing base and new logo sort of has there been a shift now there's sort of a sense of light at the end of the tunnel, has there been some sense that maybe we should start accelerating initiatives? Are you seeing any of that or is that too early? Because you sort of said you're not a beneficiary of COVID or not a large beneficiary of COVID. But coming out of this, it feels like digitization, cloud, and the integrated platform would make sense. I would love to see if you're hearing or seeing anything, any color from existing and new customers around that?\nPeter Gassner: Got it. Bhavan, about the vaccine candidates, I think, that is overall largely progressing as the life sciences industry would have expected. I think they're now thinking for the major markets that they're in. Mostly, people are going to be vaccinated sometime next year. And I think if you were to just gone back to sort of the May-ish time zone or so that would have been broadly in line with what the life science industry overall would have expected, so there's no surprises there. The major shift I think that's happening is the realization that digital is very important no the commercial side and on the clinical side. So that's probably the major beneficiary, not so much seeing the light at the end of the COVID tunnel, I think, that was anticipated. But I think the life sciences industry right now feels more comfortable with digital and will invest more in digital overall than they -- as opposed to the way they would be thinking maybe last March or April.\nBhavan Suri: Got it.\nPeter Gassner: And that'll help us as you -- broadly speaking, that'll help us, but it's not in a particular quarter, it's not a short-term thing, I think, it's a secular shift to have more digitization coming.\nBhavan Suri: Yes. And then just to follow-up on that. You sort of talked about sort of the setup here, but I think of MyVeeva for Doctors, love to know any early takeaways of MyVeeva for Patients coming out. When you offer this level of connectivity that really isn't available today and make that flow of information better, I'd love to understand what you're hearing from your customers as you talk to them about MyVeeva for Patients sort of the excitement, the interest levels, any color there would be really helpful? Thank you.\nPeter Gassner: Yes. It's really helping our -- MyVeeva, both MyVeeva for Doctors, MyVeeva for Patients is about helping our customers connect more efficiently with their customers. So there is a lot of enthusiasm there, but there's heavy change management as well. So that's something that'll take some time to work through. So it's not -- it's a business process change, particularly on the clinical side, lots of technology, and on the commercial side. So I think slow and steady uptake there, because that's a major shift. So it\u2019s too early to give it any type of a ramp.\nBhavan Suri: Fair enough. Nice job, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.\nPeter Gassner: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Christopher Merwin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nChristopher Merwin: Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about the growth in CRM customers. I think you had a record increase of 19 new customers. Was that more commercial -- kind of small commercial ones or just curious, any other detail you can share about that nice step up there in customer count? Thanks.\nPaul Shawah: Yes, Christopher, thanks. This is Paul. So, yes, we're really pleased. The 19 that Peter referenced was 19 net new CRM wins, so this is in a core CRM space, and we're seeing that really great strength in our U.S. SMB market. So these are -- many of them are pre-commercial companies, companies that are looking to launch. Others are those that are on a legacy CRM system, and they're choosing Veeva. And I think there's a couple of things that are driving this. One is the industry is looking to become more digital and more efficient, and they trust Veeva as the partner to get them there, because we've delivered on that over the last several months and over several years really. And I think the other thing is just the trust in Veeva as a strategic partner. So they need to get to digital quicker and relying on Veeva as a partner to get them there, so great momentum in CRM. We've had -- and so specifically those are kind of net new CRM wins.\nChristopher Merwin: Got it. And maybe just as a quick follow-up to that, I mean, you've seen better and better add-on adoption with those wins, and are those winning larger than they have before or anything you'd call out there?\nPaul Shawah: We do, in fact. So what is typically happening today, which is different than, let's say, two -- one or two or even three years ago is companies that three or four years ago may have come in looking for a CRM system, and they walked away with CRM and maybe one or two add-ons. What is more common today is they're looking for a broader and more strategic partner, and they're buying more products upfront, so certainly Veeva CRM and then many add-ons at the same time. Typically, all of the digital add-ons like Approved Email and Engage, they're just -- they're looking to go more digital much faster. So we are seeing uptick in CRM, but also the related add-ons as well.\nChristopher Merwin: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ken Wong with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nKen Wong: Great. Thanks for taking my question, guys. This is building a bit on Chris' question just now. Peter or Paul, can you guys perhaps talk about the competitive landscape in the CRM Commercial Cloud area? Anything you're seeing from customers during the pandemic that you think perhaps might help or hurt your competitive position here?\nPaul Shawah: Yes, it's going really well. And as evidenced by some of the numbers, first and foremost, we talked about the net new -- the record number of net new CRM wins. As a start, I would say, the overall dynamics are roughly the same, meaning, we continue to win most deals. We're increasing market share. The one thing that has changed in the competitive landscape is, over the last quarter, is we've had two replacements of IQVIA's new OCE product. So that's the product that they built on Salesforce.com, it's been out in the marketplace for a couple years now. That's a new dynamic for us that hasn't happened before.  And what we're seeing across the market is that companies are trying it. It hasn't met their expectations from a product or from a services standpoint, and they're looking to get the digital by looking to a partner that can execute and that that they can trust. So, we have -- we've had those two replacements, and I expect that those will -- those are hard, they take time. But I'm expecting those will -- we'll see more and more of those over time.\nKen Wong: Great. Thanks a lot, Paul, and maybe one for you, Brent, you touched on some gross margin headwinds as you guys start to build up the Data Cloud product. Just wondering if you might be able to help quantify what that hit might be to gross margins, and as we think about our numbers going forward, is that more of a one-time hit, is that something that will continue to build over time? Any color there would be helpful?\nBrent Bowman: Yes, as we look at gross margins going out, so there's a number of investments, so you mentioned the Data Cloud. That is something that we'll be building over time over a couple years, and we're not going to breakout specifically how much that would be, but that's been factored in to our ops margin projections for next year, our guide, as well as factored into our 2025 guide. So, I guess I'd leave you with that, from that perspective.\nKen Wong: Great, thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bryan Peterson with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nBryan Peterson: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. So I actually wanted to start with the efforts outside of life sciences. You referenced another large CPG win this quarter. I'm not sure who wants to take this, but I know there's a gradual kind of go-to-market build focus on early adopters, but has the inbound interest from large customers been quicker than you have expected, and does that potentially accelerate that timeline on the go-to-market side?\nPeter Gassner: Hi, Bryan. I would say not quicker than I expected. This is a relatively -- it's a very sticky application area that we're in there, quality and manufacturing regulatory claims management, so it's hard to get in, and hard to get out. So this is not something that they will jump on. So it's steady, it's how we expected it. Pandemic really has not affected us in there, other than a temporary thing here in the cosmetics market because that's been a hard-hit sector.\nBryan Peterson: Okay, and maybe just a follow-up, and Peter, I think I made the comment on fiscal year '22, that you were expecting the field sales reps to maybe be down about 10%. I want to make sure I heard that right, and I'm curious, is that broad-based across the customer base or is that in some instances they're down more, and some are in line. Just, I guess I'm trying to think about that for fiscal year '22, and then how that's kind of factored in to your longer-term targets?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, Bryan, I'll actually have Paul take that one.\nPaul Shawah: Yes, I'll give some commentary on that. First, the overall 10% number, so the way that we think about that is really based on multiple conversations with customers. We're always in very strategic discussions with customers, and thinking about what the future of the sales force looks like, but also based on Veeva estimates as well, it's what we believe as we look out at the market, and we help the industry become more efficient and more digital. This move to digital is really, really good for Veeva. So as we're -- as companies adopt more and more of the products in Veeva Commercial Cloud, including products like Approved Email and Engage, they become more efficient, and we're trying to drive that, we're embracing that shift. And you'll also see that shift in our innovation. So as we -- we're trying to accelerate it with new products, like MyVeeva for Doctors, helping the industry get to digital faster and more efficiently. So we have, I guess, maybe the one bigger point to think about is we've -- we're super confident in the targets still for 2025, because we've always contemplated some level of reduction. We're just -- what we're seeing is that the reduction is happening a little bit at an accelerated pace compared to where we thought it would be because the industry is moving to digital faster.\nBryan Peterson: Thanks, Paul.\nPeter Gassner: [Multiple Speakers] -- add on that\u2026\nBryan Peterson: Well, sorry, Peter.\nPeter Gassner: Sorry, and just to add on there, Bryan, the specific one about some customers more than others, not really so much, I would say it doesn't depend on therapeutic areas so much, although the more broad-based general medicines might have a little more reduction, that specialty areas might have a little less, and then there will be always company-specific factors, but there's no macro trend there why it would affect one customer more than another.\nBryan Peterson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Stan Zlotsky with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nStan Zlotsky: Hey, guys. Good afternoon and thank you so much for taking my questions, and congratulations on a very strong quarter. Peter, maybe one for you, you mentioned in your prepared remarks there's potential for global sales headcount in pharma to decline by 10% next year. When you're talking to your existing customers and thinking about how they're spend with Veeva, Veeva's Commercial Cloud would trend. How are they thinking about the strategic positioning of your product and in order to frankly just enable them to sell, versus the potential headwind of less receipts?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, Stan, as they reduce receipts, what's happening is the selling motion is becoming more digital and more technology-enabled. So, that's a good trend for Veeva because they'll be spending a bit more on technology and data to power that technology, and a little bit less on the people, so that's a good trend for us, so the overall we're happy about the Commercial Cloud growth for, we'll certainly grow Commercial Cloud next year and on into 2025. Because of that trend that's in our favor actually, this is -- as Paul mentioned this is something we knew, we knew it's going to come, we thought it would come a little more gradually, and the COVID has been kind of a little boost on it.\nStan Zlotsky: Got it, got it. That makes sense, and then, on billings right duration I would guess this is for Brent, you mentioned that you saw a little bit of a benefit in Q3 to billings, due to slow longer duration. Could you dig into that a little bit, and anything to note on FX or anything else one time that you saw in Q3 billings?\nBrent Bowman: Yes, I'll answer your second question first. So regarding FX, very minimal tailwind on FX, so nothing to release to note there, and then on the duration, it's really a factor, a function of the customer and the specific deal and sometimes in Q3, you often see coterminous fields, we saw a few less coterminous, and that created the duration tailwind that I spoke of.\nStan Zlotsky: All right, thank you so much.\nOperator: Next question is from Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nRishi Jaluria: Hey guys thanks for taking my questions and nice to see continued strong execution. I wanted to start maybe with talking about CRM Engage at the virtual analyst; they recently gave us some really impressive numbers on Engage meetings growth this year. I think you said, 891% growth on Engage meetings started with when you gave that number, just how should we be thinking about that, how should we think about traction with the Engage business next year especially as the Engage meetings, free period, and December 31st and kind of putting that in context as well with the commentary around that 10% reduction in the field sales force that you expect next year? And then, I got a follow-up.\nPeter Gassner: All right, let me take that one first. So, the Engage trend continues to go really well, companies are continuing to adopt, they're continuing to learn how to use it right. This isn't -- this is a change in a lot of change management involved in becoming more digital. So, our customers are getting better, we're helping them, we're providing, not only the software and the technology, but also the domain expertise and the business guidance around doing Engage and using it really efficiently. We are where our customers are seeing value. We're well into that and into the discussions around renewals. Those are happening as that the free period ends at the end of the year. We expect the majority of companies that started with free Engage are going to continue in the next year, because it's working. This is -- the product is working in the marketplace and they trust us as a strategic partner. So, most companies will continue with that. Your question was also about next year. I do expect that most companies will continue, but they wouldn't -- they won't get a full deployment this year, they'll reach a significant amount of their users, but I think most companies you'll see also expansion opportunity next year, and even into the year follow as well.\nRishi Jaluria: Okay, got it. That's helpful, and then, just on the preliminary outlook for next year. I guess a little surprised on seeing the subscription revenue target because that's closer to 19% growth and I know historically there's been kind of the discussion of sustaining and 20% plus subscription growth rate for the foreseeable future. Just want to maybe get a sense for what assumptions are baked into the outlook on this subscription fund right. I mean, especially talking about the fact that you're on target to do 24% organic subscription growth this year ex Crossix and physicians world, I'm talking about 19% growth next year, maybe help us understand that and any moving pieces that might be a good thing there.\nPeter Gassner: Sure. I'm happy to. So, first I'm very pleased by the strong demand and their ability for us to drive customer success. So, this guide for next year lines us up very well for us to get our 2025 targets, not going to get into any splits regarding what's under the hood on that, that's typical that would come in our Q4 call. So I'm not going to give you any color around that, but we're very positive and feel good about the growth we're seeing in the bulk space, as well as the continued growth in the commercial space.\nRishi Jaluria: All right, great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sandy Draper with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nSandy Draper: Thanks so much. A lot of my questions have been asked and answered. So maybe just one on the Data acquisition and the cost there, when you're looking at finding new data sources and connections? Are you trying to go to customers or data sources that that others are in a sense that you're going to try to get exclusive rights to data as this data sources that other people data connectivity or system connectivity, and finding a way that others can? I'm just trying to understand the approach to building that that data set and how they think about, I know you're not going to specifically carve out costs, but how to think about cost versus what you're paying versus what maybe a competitor might pay? Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: Yes, I'll take that one. We'll keep that a little bit close to the best Data acquisition, Data production strategy. So that's a bit of proprietary things that we're doing, that's very unique to Data Cloud, and that's one of the reasons why we really think we found a jewel in the Crossix and the Crossix Data platform, because the way it ingests, the way it matches the patient data is quite unique, but I will give you some broad brush, we hope to come in data cost less than our competitors, and we hope to have more data sources. So multiple triangulations of each different data transaction in the healthcare system, because when you think about it, when there's interaction between the patient and the doctor payer, multiple people have copies of that information because of our technology, we're able to piece that together, so we get multiple views on it, and at a lower cost, because we're not dependent on any one particular view, so very happy about that. Then if we step back, what is actually going on with Data Cloud. It's a real difference in how we're making the state of the data products, it says different as moving from client server to cloud software. So we're focusing on the longitudinal patient data, the real picture of the patient as they flow through healthcare events in the same longitudinal view from the prescribers point of view. So I would say, it's not going to be too valid to compare us either to the entrench way of doing things, because we're going to do a fundamentally different thing.\nSandy Draper: Got it. That's really helpful, I guess that maybe will lead me to my follow-up, Peter, in terms of so it sounds like once you have to build the dataset, but there may be an education process, because the intense way of doing things is by definition and trends, and so, you're going to have to get behavioral change and get people to change things that they've been doing for years and years and years. So I guess the first step is build the data set to a point and then it's really educating the market about why you think you're going to have something better, is that a reasonable way to think about it?\nPeter Gassner: Absolutely, it'll follow the classic early adopter cycle that you find when you're doing true innovation because you'll have to find those people that they want to be early on the product maturity lifecycle, but also open to a way of doing things fundamentally different. Now, oftentimes, that'll happen with small biotechs, we're really, really looking for that edge, you'll find that larger companies may be more conservative, and maybe rightly so they have a larger boat to steer. So they'll be gradual. I didn't want to connect the dots to between Data Cloud and our CRM win, as Paul mentioned, customers looking for product and a customer they can trust, which is true, but also especially the small biotechs, they're now seeing that vision of Data Cloud well, maybe I can get the complete commercial package together; Data Insights, analytics, technology, all from Veeva. So I think the Data Cloud business will have a positive effect on our CRM business over time, and it's already even showing today.\nSandy Draper: Great, that's really helpful commentary, Peter. I appreciate it.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is open.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey, thanks for taking my questions here guys. Maybe first for you, Peter, I think the uptake on CTMS is great to see in Vault clinical. I think it was something like 75 customers in just three years of availability, and I'm curious, how would you compare this ramp in CTMS to CDMS and perhaps how each ramp could be different in terms of adoption then and perhaps bookings contribution? Does that make sense?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. Sorry, I was trying to get myself off mute. Let's see. They are quite a different applications. One thing is CTMS built. They were started roughly the same time CTMS in terms of the applications themselves at Veeva, CTMS maybe a year, a little more here. So before CDMS, CTMS was built on the base of the clinical operations suite that we had from CTMS. So that gave it a head start, and overall CDMS is a, I would guess a harder or a deeper application to build. So CTMS gotten mature faster than CDMS [technical difficulty] directly connects to the clinical research site. So there'll be a little more hesitant there. They have to build their studies. So we'll start with a few trials studies that will be a little more cautious. So it's a more cautious market. CDMS also, we had them build Veeva's reputation in the clinical data management area that's what we've [technical difficulty] for about six or seven years. So it was well established. So that's why CTMS goes faster than CDMS, but make no mistake. One of the best indicators of future CDMS [technical difficulty] how it relates to Vault, one of the ways you could think about that, how we're doing that in our framework is setting up AI as series of Vault that can handle a task that is a well-formed task, so that a human doesn't have to handle it. You mentioned safety data AI, that where that plays is the intake of a case. So some words come in either through an email or some other form, those words have to be read and understand well, what is actually going on here? What product is this case about? What actual -- how do I code the complaint that it's about? How I seen a duplicate before? So that's a pretty high volume thing and that's where we can apply safety.ai on it. You'll see other areas involved, another area you'll see next year is classifying documents in that come into an inbox as it relates to a clinical trial. That's another relatively high volume area that needs to be done, and that's something where a Vault can handle it. You'll see that in the quality suite over time as well in terms of product complaints, which is different than a safety event that is I didn't enjoy this product. This product had a bad color et cetera. That's a product packaging was off et cetera. That's a complaint. So it's things like that where you'll see that automation over time.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. That's great, and I wanted to make sure I'm just totally clear on the outlook for Engage. Paul, when you talk about most of the growth kind of happening this year is that just insight on the potential new users that you already have visibility on and kind of the contribution of those new users from a financial standpoint will therefore slow when next fiscal year, fiscal 2022 is, is that the right sequencing?\nPaul Shawah: Yes. So when I was referencing companies that have turned on free Engage and will continue to renew, and that will end up being the larger contribution. When you look at the overall size of the engaged market, the bump that we'll see this year will be larger than the bump that we see next year, and even perhaps the year beyond that as well, because many of our customers have turned on for Engage, and we expect the majority of them to continue with a renewable. So we'll see a significant increase of this year, and then, and over time more of our customers, those same companies will expand their usage of Engage, but also net new companies will happen as well, the companies that haven't turned on Engage yet for whatever reason, will start to turn it on over time.\nPeter Gassner: And maybe Joe, if I might be able to add, that'll manifest itself as a bump in billings this fiscal year, and then you will see that revenue contribution in fiscal year '22, just to be clear.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Ryan MacDonald with Needham. Your line is open.\nRyan MacDonald: I'm Ryan MacDonald on Scott Berg. Thanks for taking my question. At the Analyst Day, Brent, I believe slide showing modules per customer trends by year with penetration increasing from 2.41 in fiscal '20 to 2.5 to recently. As the company looks at subscription growth expectations, moving forward, but expanding -- you are expanding your penetration by less than a quarter of module annually. How should we think about the view of the cross-sell cadence to be over the near-term to drive 20% plus subscription growth? This is just not a penetration need to increase or decrease to achieve these growth rates?\nBrent Bowman: I think you'll -- you should expect to see a consistent cadence of additional upsell within our install base, with the balance of new business as well, so I don't think the motion from that perspective, you should expect to change for us to be able to hit the targets that we've established.\nRyan MacDonald: Excellent, and as a follow-up, it's great to see the cross excess starting to come in above initial expectations for this year and sort of recovering a bit, but if we look at look at the expectations for physician's world, it seems like those have remained I think relatively consistent. As we are now starting to get visibility into a vaccine, how are you starting to think about the recovery for that physician's world business and perhaps some assumptions that you're looking at going into calendar year '21? Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: I'll take that into the traditional world that will. Excuse me, gentlemen. That'll recover sort of with I think with the vaccine where people feel comfortable, broadly speaking in the face-to-face event, so we're looking towards sometime towards the end of next year I think that would be a reasonable expectation for the physician to begin. Now having said that, we are starting to get really momentum and starting to lead a bit in innovation we're doing around digital. So there's a potential that in the long-term as we look at maybe not next year, but the following year, I believe you're going to be gaining market share there and adding more value with both digital and face-to-face events and other services around that. So, I'm pretty bullish on the physician world business. It'll have another nine months, of a little lagging in fact right now.\nRyan MacDonald: Excellent, thanks again.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brad Sills with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills: Oh, great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about clinical top 50, it's been a market segment that you've seen some real progress and recently. Can you remind us kind of where we are in the replacement cycle for that particular segment, are we are -- you've got a number of wins there already in the top 20 category? Should we expect more of those types of wins or we are you looking at the next tier down, where you can see more progress. You've been on this very steady kind of reference selling approach there, it seems like you've got the references now and so perhaps we could see a tipping point of replacement, so any color you can provide on kind of where we are in that cycle. Thank you.\nPeter Gassner: Yes. It's an important system for the clinical operations and then the clinical data management. In the clinical there's those two areas: clinical operations, clinical data management. In clinical data management, we are very, very early just -- we have a handful of customers very, very early, so it's basically mostly Greenfield has legacy players out there that we have to replace and that'll happen over the next really literally 5 and 10 years, the long road. In clinical operations, we have our eTMF, which has pretty good market share that was our first, but out of those top 50 I don't have the exact number of how many these are eTMF, but there is still a decent amount to go that we have to get. Then there's more in CTMS, and there's Payments, which is a new module, Studies are relatively new module, their study startup, but the big thing in clinical, the clinical network, that's a whole new, whole new leg of applications, and that applies to the Top 50, and also, all the other clinical applications. So we're very early days in clinical, you only really have one you truly roughly materially penetrated application and that eTMF and has a way to go, it's early days.\nBrad Sills: Got it. Thanks, Peter, and then, you mentioned your expectation for kind of consistent growth in outside Life Sciences, it sounds like pretty balanced across CPG, chemicals, cosmetics, is that just a function of kind of awareness needs to build in that category in order for you to see more acceleration there, is it just go to market resources, is it product, maybe we just don't need to expect that business to really ramp and there's because there's so much opportunity within Life Sciences, but I guess any color on kind of what's driving that more kind of balanced, steady growth in that business?\nPeter Gassner: First of all, we're happy with that growth numbers, we gave at the Analyst Day. So it's closed pretty nicely, when you look at it, $100 million or so in that neighborhood by 2025. Now, what happens there is that's a slow and steady growing industry there, it's you've got a lot of capital costs, it's not one that's prone to jump very quickly, and it has a natural adoption lifecycle. Companies have investments in previous technologies, they need to see those through, write those off, and it tends to be very cautious and capital efficient industry. So that's what's going on there, and now it's not to, we need more feet on the street or something like that, or product in the system. That record selling cycle, you only have so many early adopters, middle majority, and then you have late adopters.\nBrad Sills: Got it. Thanks so much, Peter.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Stephanie Davis with SVB Leerink. Your line is open.\nStephanie Davis: Thank you for taking my questions, and congrats on the quarter. Just a quick question, given some of the startups we're seeing in the space. There's a growing number of drug development phase and IT startups, what are your IT and M&A priorities in these adjacent markets with that in mind, and you'll be lower bounds for assets that you could or would acquire either on scale or product maturity, as many of them are relatively new?\nPeter Gassner: Thanks, Stephanie. In terms of M&A, that's something we always keep our eye on, we're always looking in general, we would like to, if we can find something that is in a market that we would like to go into, we can find a seed of innovation that will provide us with a boost, or a boost of either technology or in the core knowledge, we will do that, or where we can find something that's supplied to a certain area, and we feel like we can acquire that asset, those people that fit with our culture, and then give them a bigger canvas to play on, so that they can accomplish more. The best example I have there, it's with the Crossix, Crossix for marketing analytics that has tremendous data platform behind it, when we combine Crossix with Veeva, then we can take on the full life sciences Data Play, which is 10 times larger than marketing analytics on market there. So there's not a specific area that we're looking at, or that I can talk about now, but we're always looking and keeping an eye on it.\nStephanie Davis: All right. Understood and then following up with some of the earlier questions about your Data product, how real is the trend towards real world evidence? And when can we see maybe some offerings that are a little bit more laid out within your solution?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, in terms of real world evidence, that's a real thing, right. You have your sort of non-real world or traditional data that might be used for sales compensation, targeting and planning that type of thing, and then you have a real world evidence, which can be used in the commercial side, but also in R&D side. So that is real. Our focus is not in the real world evidence versus in the commercial data. So we got to get that right. Now that asset we have in the Crossix data platform. Absolutely that's going to be relevant -- real data in the future, and we wouldn't do it in a very integrative way, but first thing is first, then that's a longitudinal patient data that we'll get that going, and then we'll expand from there.\nStephanie Davis: Would you more likely to sell off that data for now or keep it yourself and look at them invasion and development a little bit later?\nPeter Gassner: Oh, yes. We would not sell any raw data rights. We have a long time selling that caustic data network, that data platform, and we'll continue to do it and then build it. We use that for our internal use in our consulting group that may be used that, but then we'll use it to make products for customers, but it's not a type of thing where we would OEM or something like that.\nStephanie Davis: I understand. Thanks a lot.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question is from Sterling Auty with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nSterling Auty: Yes, thanks. Hi guys. So, super high-level question to start, you know, with the outcome of the Presidential Election, assuming it holds as is and the potential for the runoffs in Georgia, is there anything that you're keeping an eye on from a regulatory or legislative action that you think would have direct impact one way or the other, either on the business or to your customers that could impact your business in the next year or two?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. Hi, Sterling. Thanks for your question. So, I mean, we're certainly keeping an eye on what is happening with the election and also what happens around legislation and policy as our customers, but the reality is, the industry is a big industry. It's a global industry. These kinds of things elections happen all the time. Legislation changes, policy changes all the time and it tends to be balanced out by a lot of the innovation that happens in the industry innovating a new medicines and really everybody focused on driving patient outcomes and doing the right thing for patients. So that's a long way to say that, some of these changes they tend to be a wash with the innovation. We haven't seen any impact yet on our customers, and we don't really expect any impact of some of those changes in the political landscape over the near-term either.\nSterling Auty: All right, excellent, and then one follow-up question, there was a couple of questions around CTMS, and I'm just kind of curious, has anything changed in the competitive landscape in terms of your head that one legacy strong fold with Oracle, Siebel, CTMS, -- metadata had an offering, but you kind of came in and I think we're doing a better job waiting. Is anything changed in terms of any other vendors that you're seeing more active in that space or any change to kind of win rates or displacements?\nPeter Gassner: Sterling, no new entrance that we're aware of; no change to the competitive dynamics, we're really replacing the client server there. I guess the only caveat is customers are seeing that Veeva has success in CTMS at scale at the large enterprise. So, that's sort of a de-risk for people, and I think many customers are thinking, \"When would I go to see the CTMS? When does it make sense to --\" because at this point I think they have the best alternative to the market and the proven solution.\nSterling Auty: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nPeter Gassner: Thanks, Sterling.\nOperator: And this does conclude Veeva's Q&A session. I'll now turn the call back over to Peter for any closing remarks.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you all for joining us today. I'd also like to extend a special thanks to Rick Lund for all his years of service and contributions at Veeva. This is Rick's last earnings call with us and we wish him well, and his next role as a CFO, and I wish you all a happy holiday season, and we look forward to talking with you next year. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brent Bowman",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Q3 was a quarter of very strong execution. Bookings and services performance were both better than expected, with notable acceleration in Development Cloud applications like CTMS and QMS that are early in the reference selling cycle. This led to outperformance in both subscription and services revenue. This strong demand in bookings and services also led to a calculated billings total that was $26 million above our guidance for the quarter. Billings also benefited from better than expected billing duration for the business closed in Q3. Hiring performance in Q3 was also especially strong. We ended the quarter with 4,304 employees, a net increase of 280 from Q2. Much of this increase in headcount was within our Vault services teams and in our product teams, especially those product teams working on newer applications like CDMS safety, Data Cloud, and MyVeeva. Q3 operating margin benefited from roughly 250 basis points of pandemic-related cost savings from reduced travel and customer events that have moved to virtual, a level similar to the previous quarter. We anticipate a comparable benefit to operating margins in Q4 and into the beginning of next year. Turning to guidance for the fourth quarter, total revenue is expected to be $378 million to $380 million with subscription revenue of roughly $315 million and services revenue of $63 million to $65 million. Note that this implies a sequential drop in services revenue of about $10 million to $12 million from the third quarter, while our services business always has a high degree of variability. There are a couple of reasons for the size of this change. The biggest factor is our normal seasonal pattern resulting from fewer billable days around the holidays and our field kickoff. Our digital events business also has a similar seasonal pattern with fewer events around the holiday. Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter is expected to be $136 million to $138 million, a non-GAAP operating margin of about 36%. Note that while Q4 is typically a seedling lower margin quarter, this year, we expect incremental expenses related to additional data supplier contracts as we invest in our Data Cloud product. These expenses will appear in our costs of subscription services revenue line. We will also continue to aggressively hire as we scale to meet near-term demand and plant seeds for longer term growth. Q4 non-GAAP EPS is projected to be $0.67 to $0.68 based on diluted share count of approximately $162.5 million. We anticipate calculated billings of roughly $640 million in Q4. That this includes a benefit of about $10 million related to one large customer we expect to switch from quarterly to annual billing term. Please remember, that there are numerous factors that make year-over-year comparisons of this metric highly variable on a quarterly basis. Therefore we do not believe quarterly billings grow is a good indicator of the underlying momentum of our business, and we do not manage to it internally. Our subscription revenue guidance and calculated billings guidance for the full-year are the best indicators of our momentum. All of these Q4 guidance metrics imply the following numbers for the full-year. Total revenue of $1.446 billion to $1.448 billion, Subscription revenue of about $1.172 billion, non-GAAP operating income of $566 million to $568 million, and calculate billings of about 1,550 million. We now project non-GAAP EPS for the full-year of $2.83 to $2.84 based on a fully diluted share count of approximately $161 million. Note that within subscription revenue, we expect commercial cloud to finish the year at about $595 million and Vaults come in at about $577 million. We now expect prospects to contribute $78 million to $80 million within subscription revenue. This is up $2 million from our previous estimate and that business has benefited from the gradual rebound of advertising spend within life sciences companies. Within the total revenue line, we now expect to combine contribution from book Crossix and positioned world to represent $97 million to $100 million for the full-year. Finally, we are also raising our guidance for the full-year cash flow from operations, excluding the excess tax benefit to $500 million, up from $475 million previously, based primarily on billings outperformance in Q3. Before I close, let me give an initial outlook for fiscal 2022. Please note that we are still in the process of finalizing the plan and we'll provide a formal guidance on the Q4 earnings call. Currently, our initial outlook for next year is for total revenue of $1.700 billion to $1.720 billion. Within that guide, we expect subscription revenue of roughly $1.390 billion to $1.400 billion. We will provide more specific guidance on the next earnings call, including breakdowns of Commercial Cloud and Vault. Overall, the life science industry remains healthy, and continues to invest for the future, which gives us confidence in this early guide for next year. Based on our early spinning plans, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of roughly 37% for the full-year. This would represent a compression of about 200 basis points from fiscal '21, which is driven primarily by three things. First, we plan to continue investing in our Data Cloud product through additional data supplier relationships. Second, we're assuming that travel and event-related expenses will start to return at some point next year. Lastly, we plan to continue hiring aggressively for customer success and product innovation. With that, let me close by saying that I'm extremely pleased with the results in the quarter, and I'm very excited for the foundation we've laid for next year. The team's outstanding and consistent performance gives me confidence in our ability to achieve our target of $3 billion in total revenue in calendar 2025. Thanks for joining us today. And now, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Yes, as we look at gross margins going out, so there's a number of investments, so you mentioned the Data Cloud. That is something that we'll be building over time over a couple years, and we're not going to breakout specifically how much that would be, but that's been factored in to our ops margin projections for next year, our guide, as well as factored into our 2025 guide. So, I guess I'd leave you with that, from that perspective. Yes, I'll answer your second question first. So regarding FX, very minimal tailwind on FX, so nothing to release to note there, and then on the duration, it's really a factor, a function of the customer and the specific deal and sometimes in Q3, you often see coterminous fields, we saw a few less coterminous, and that created the duration tailwind that I spoke of. I think you'll -- you should expect to see a consistent cadence of additional upsell within our install base, with the balance of new business as well, so I don't think the motion from that perspective, you should expect to change for us to be able to hit the targets that we've established."

            "content": "Thank you, Ato. Before we get started, I'd like to extend our sympathies to everyone affected by the pandemic, and our gratitude to all those working to help in so many ways, including our customers. The industry has produced effective vaccine candidates, rapid diagnostics, and approved treatments, all in a matter of months. We are proud to be working with these amazing companies, and I'm proud of how the Veeva team has stepped up to help. Now, turning to Q3. We had another quarter of consistent execution and results ahead of guidance. Total revenue was $378 million, up 34% year-over-year. Subscription revenue also grew 34% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating margin was 41%. We are pleased with our results and how we're expanding customer relationships during a major digital transformation. We've been able to help customers with immediate needs to open up digital channels in commercial and clinical, and we're also helping them to find the right digital models for the long-term. For example, on the commercial side, we recently announced the strategic partnership with an emerging biopharma to help them define and execute an innovative digital-first commercial model. They will utilize the full commercial cloud, including Veeva CRM, Data Cloud, Veeva Link, MyVeeva, and Business Consulting. That level of trust and confidence in our ability to deliver came through strongly in our Q3 new wins and expansions. We added 19 new CRM customers, our biggest quarterly increase yet. We continue to grow market share and had multiple international expansions in CRM with existing customers. We also progressed well in our newer areas, including Data Cloud, MyVeeva for Doctors, and Veeva Link. We expect these products will set us up for a long runway of growth in commercial. It's an exciting time in commercial and a time of change. We think our customers can generate meaningful productivity gains over the coming years as they increasingly leverage digital. We're excited to enable that transformation through our technology. With Veeva Vault, we've seen significant progress in Development Cloud adoption. Customers are increasingly purchasing multiple products at once, including our recently announced top five pharma, who selected Veeva Vault products in clinical operations, quality, and regulatory. This is a major transformation, which they will implement over the next two to three years. We're also seeing more customers expand Vault usage within each area of Development Cloud. In clinical operations, Vault CTMS had a standout quarter. We now have more than 75 customers, including six of the top 20 that have chosen to standardize on Vault CTMS. This is a remarkable pace of adoption, given the product was launched just over three years ago. This rapid uptake is based on the trust we've built in clinical operations with Vault eTMF, and the power of having a unified suite for clinical operations. In the area of clinical I am particularly excited about is Veeva Clinical Network, where we're bringing real innovation to the industry to help advance the move to paperless and patient-centric clinical trials. Clinical Network connects sponsors, sites, and patients, and has the potential to fundamentally change how the industry conducts trials. We announced our first Clinical Network application, Veeva Site Connect, to connect sites and sponsors, and in Q3 closed our first top 20 customer for Site Connect. In Quality, we had 20 net new customers select Vault QualityDocs, and we now have 12 of the top 20 pharmas as QualityDocs customers. Safety also continues to progress well with our early adopters, and we added four new customers. We also started our first Safety AI project in the quarter. Outside of life sciences, as the pandemic continues to drive changes in consumer goods and cosmetics, companies are looking to us for agile global solutions that can help them quickly adapt. This dynamic drove a major win in Q3 with another large CPG customer. We also brought together nearly 800 liters from across consumer goods, cosmetics, and chemicals for an Online Quality and Regulatory Summit to share best practices and insights. Overall, we are pleased with our growing reach and momentum in these industries. Now, I'll share some additional thoughts as we look ahead to next year. On the Commercial Cloud side of the business, customers will find new ways to be more efficient by adopting our digital solutions. We believe this will likely drive field force reductions in the neighborhood of 10% over the coming year. At the same time, we expect to increase market share in CRM and see further adoption of CRM add-on products such as Engage, Events, and Align. We also expect greater adoption for Veeva Link, and it will be an important early adopter year for Data Cloud and MyVeeva. We expect Vault to continue its strong growth, particularly Development Cloud, with progress across the Board in clinical, quality, and regulatory. It's still early in terms of revenue for CDMS and Safety, but we have very strong early adopter momentum and broad customer interest, which will serve us well in these large markets in the coming years. We're also excited about the future of Clinical Network, and we expect another year of consistent growth outside of life sciences in CPG, chemicals, and cosmetics. And finally, I'd like to update you on our proposed conversion to a public benefit corporation. We have completed our communication process with customers and investors, and the feedback has been largely positive. We also completed the comment process with the SEC and are filing a revised proxy this week. We will hold a special shareholder meeting to vote on the proposed PBC conversion on January 13. In closing, I'd like to say how proud I am of the Veeva team for the exceptional teamwork, flexibility, innovation, and execution throughout the year. It's that combination of trust, great people, and great products that has put us in a position to really help the industry during this time of change. Now, I'll turn it over to Brent for a financial update. Got it. Bhavan, about the vaccine candidates, I think, that is overall largely progressing as the life sciences industry would have expected. I think they're now thinking for the major markets that they're in. Mostly, people are going to be vaccinated sometime next year. And I think if you were to just gone back to sort of the May-ish time zone or so that would have been broadly in line with what the life science industry overall would have expected, so there's no surprises there. The major shift I think that's happening is the realization that digital is very important no the commercial side and on the clinical side. So that's probably the major beneficiary, not so much seeing the light at the end of the COVID tunnel, I think, that was anticipated. But I think the life sciences industry right now feels more comfortable with digital and will invest more in digital overall than they -- as opposed to the way they would be thinking maybe last March or April. And that'll help us as you -- broadly speaking, that'll help us, but it's not in a particular quarter, it's not a short-term thing, I think, it's a secular shift to have more digitization coming. Yes. It's really helping our -- MyVeeva, both MyVeeva for Doctors, MyVeeva for Patients is about helping our customers connect more efficiently with their customers. So there is a lot of enthusiasm there, but there's heavy change management as well. So that's something that'll take some time to work through. So it's not -- it's a business process change, particularly on the clinical side, lots of technology, and on the commercial side. So I think slow and steady uptake there, because that's a major shift. So it's too early to give it any type of a ramp. Thanks. Hi, Bryan. I would say not quicker than I expected. This is a relatively -- it's a very sticky application area that we're in there, quality and manufacturing regulatory claims management, so it's hard to get in, and hard to get out. So this is not something that they will jump on. So it's steady, it's how we expected it. Pandemic really has not affected us in there, other than a temporary thing here in the cosmetics market because that's been a hard-hit sector. Yes, Bryan, I'll actually have Paul take that one. [Multiple Speakers] -- add on that... Sorry, and just to add on there, Bryan, the specific one about some customers more than others, not really so much, I would say it doesn't depend on therapeutic areas so much, although the more broad-based general medicines might have a little more reduction, that specialty areas might have a little less, and then there will be always company-specific factors, but there's no macro trend there why it would affect one customer more than another. Yes, Stan, as they reduce receipts, what's happening is the selling motion is becoming more digital and more technology-enabled. So, that's a good trend for Veeva because they'll be spending a bit more on technology and data to power that technology, and a little bit less on the people, so that's a good trend for us, so the overall we're happy about the Commercial Cloud growth for, we'll certainly grow Commercial Cloud next year and on into 2025. Because of that trend that's in our favor actually, this is -- as Paul mentioned this is something we knew, we knew it's going to come, we thought it would come a little more gradually, and the COVID has been kind of a little boost on it. All right, let me take that one first. So, the Engage trend continues to go really well, companies are continuing to adopt, they're continuing to learn how to use it right. This isn't -- this is a change in a lot of change management involved in becoming more digital. So, our customers are getting better, we're helping them, we're providing, not only the software and the technology, but also the domain expertise and the business guidance around doing Engage and using it really efficiently. We are where our customers are seeing value. We're well into that and into the discussions around renewals. Those are happening as that the free period ends at the end of the year. We expect the majority of companies that started with free Engage are going to continue in the next year, because it's working. This is -- the product is working in the marketplace and they trust us as a strategic partner. So, most companies will continue with that. Your question was also about next year. I do expect that most companies will continue, but they wouldn't -- they won't get a full deployment this year, they'll reach a significant amount of their users, but I think most companies you'll see also expansion opportunity next year, and even into the year follow as well. Sure. I'm happy to. So, first I'm very pleased by the strong demand and their ability for us to drive customer success. So, this guide for next year lines us up very well for us to get our 2025 targets, not going to get into any splits regarding what's under the hood on that, that's typical that would come in our Q4 call. So I'm not going to give you any color around that, but we're very positive and feel good about the growth we're seeing in the bulk space, as well as the continued growth in the commercial space. Yes, I'll take that one. We'll keep that a little bit close to the best Data acquisition, Data production strategy. So that's a bit of proprietary things that we're doing, that's very unique to Data Cloud, and that's one of the reasons why we really think we found a jewel in the Crossix and the Crossix Data platform, because the way it ingests, the way it matches the patient data is quite unique, but I will give you some broad brush, we hope to come in data cost less than our competitors, and we hope to have more data sources. So multiple triangulations of each different data transaction in the healthcare system, because when you think about it, when there's interaction between the patient and the doctor payer, multiple people have copies of that information because of our technology, we're able to piece that together, so we get multiple views on it, and at a lower cost, because we're not dependent on any one particular view, so very happy about that. Then if we step back, what is actually going on with Data Cloud. It's a real difference in how we're making the state of the data products, it says different as moving from client server to cloud software. So we're focusing on the longitudinal patient data, the real picture of the patient as they flow through healthcare events in the same longitudinal view from the prescribers point of view. So I would say, it's not going to be too valid to compare us either to the entrench way of doing things, because we're going to do a fundamentally different thing. Absolutely, it'll follow the classic early adopter cycle that you find when you're doing true innovation because you'll have to find those people that they want to be early on the product maturity lifecycle, but also open to a way of doing things fundamentally different. Now, oftentimes, that'll happen with small biotechs, we're really, really looking for that edge, you'll find that larger companies may be more conservative, and maybe rightly so they have a larger boat to steer. So they'll be gradual. I didn't want to connect the dots to between Data Cloud and our CRM win, as Paul mentioned, customers looking for product and a customer they can trust, which is true, but also especially the small biotechs, they're now seeing that vision of Data Cloud well, maybe I can get the complete commercial package together; Data Insights, analytics, technology, all from Veeva. So I think the Data Cloud business will have a positive effect on our CRM business over time, and it's already even showing today. Thank you. Yes. Sorry, I was trying to get myself off mute. Let's see. They are quite a different applications. One thing is CTMS built. They were started roughly the same time CTMS in terms of the applications themselves at Veeva, CTMS maybe a year, a little more here. So before CDMS, CTMS was built on the base of the clinical operations suite that we had from CTMS. So that gave it a head start, and overall CDMS is a, I would guess a harder or a deeper application to build. So CTMS gotten mature faster than CDMS [technical difficulty] directly connects to the clinical research site. So there'll be a little more hesitant there. They have to build their studies. So we'll start with a few trials studies that will be a little more cautious. So it's a more cautious market. CDMS also, we had them build Veeva's reputation in the clinical data management area that's what we've [technical difficulty] for about six or seven years. So it was well established. So that's why CTMS goes faster than CDMS, but make no mistake. One of the best indicators of future CDMS [technical difficulty] how it relates to Vault, one of the ways you could think about that, how we're doing that in our framework is setting up AI as series of Vault that can handle a task that is a well-formed task, so that a human doesn't have to handle it. You mentioned safety data AI, that where that plays is the intake of a case. So some words come in either through an email or some other form, those words have to be read and understand well, what is actually going on here? What product is this case about? What actual -- how do I code the complaint that it's about? How I seen a duplicate before? So that's a pretty high volume thing and that's where we can apply safety.ai on it. You'll see other areas involved, another area you'll see next year is classifying documents in that come into an inbox as it relates to a clinical trial. That's another relatively high volume area that needs to be done, and that's something where a Vault can handle it. You'll see that in the quality suite over time as well in terms of product complaints, which is different than a safety event that is I didn't enjoy this product. This product had a bad color et cetera. That's a product packaging was off et cetera. That's a complaint. So it's things like that where you'll see that automation over time. And maybe Joe, if I might be able to add, that'll manifest itself as a bump in billings this fiscal year, and then you will see that revenue contribution in fiscal year '22, just to be clear. I'll take that into the traditional world that will. Excuse me, gentlemen. That'll recover sort of with I think with the vaccine where people feel comfortable, broadly speaking in the face-to-face event, so we're looking towards sometime towards the end of next year I think that would be a reasonable expectation for the physician to begin. Now having said that, we are starting to get really momentum and starting to lead a bit in innovation we're doing around digital. So there's a potential that in the long-term as we look at maybe not next year, but the following year, I believe you're going to be gaining market share there and adding more value with both digital and face-to-face events and other services around that. So, I'm pretty bullish on the physician world business. It'll have another nine months, of a little lagging in fact right now. Yes. It's an important system for the clinical operations and then the clinical data management. In the clinical there's those two areas: clinical operations, clinical data management. In clinical data management, we are very, very early just -- we have a handful of customers very, very early, so it's basically mostly Greenfield has legacy players out there that we have to replace and that'll happen over the next really literally 5 and 10 years, the long road. In clinical operations, we have our eTMF, which has pretty good market share that was our first, but out of those top 50 I don't have the exact number of how many these are eTMF, but there is still a decent amount to go that we have to get. Then there's more in CTMS, and there's Payments, which is a new module, Studies are relatively new module, their study startup, but the big thing in clinical, the clinical network, that's a whole new, whole new leg of applications, and that applies to the Top 50, and also, all the other clinical applications. So we're very early days in clinical, you only really have one you truly roughly materially penetrated application and that eTMF and has a way to go, it's early days. First of all, we're happy with that growth numbers, we gave at the Analyst Day. So it's closed pretty nicely, when you look at it, $100 million or so in that neighborhood by 2025. Now, what happens there is that's a slow and steady growing industry there, it's you've got a lot of capital costs, it's not one that's prone to jump very quickly, and it has a natural adoption lifecycle. Companies have investments in previous technologies, they need to see those through, write those off, and it tends to be very cautious and capital efficient industry. So that's what's going on there, and now it's not to, we need more feet on the street or something like that, or product in the system. That record selling cycle, you only have so many early adopters, middle majority, and then you have late adopters. Thank you. Thanks, Stephanie. In terms of M&A, that's something we always keep our eye on, we're always looking in general, we would like to, if we can find something that is in a market that we would like to go into, we can find a seed of innovation that will provide us with a boost, or a boost of either technology or in the core knowledge, we will do that, or where we can find something that's supplied to a certain area, and we feel like we can acquire that asset, those people that fit with our culture, and then give them a bigger canvas to play on, so that they can accomplish more. The best example I have there, it's with the Crossix, Crossix for marketing analytics that has tremendous data platform behind it, when we combine Crossix with Veeva, then we can take on the full life sciences Data Play, which is 10 times larger than marketing analytics on market there. So there's not a specific area that we're looking at, or that I can talk about now, but we're always looking and keeping an eye on it. Yes, in terms of real world evidence, that's a real thing, right. You have your sort of non-real world or traditional data that might be used for sales compensation, targeting and planning that type of thing, and then you have a real world evidence, which can be used in the commercial side, but also in R&D side. So that is real. Our focus is not in the real world evidence versus in the commercial data. So we got to get that right. Now that asset we have in the Crossix data platform. Absolutely that's going to be relevant -- real data in the future, and we wouldn't do it in a very integrative way, but first thing is first, then that's a longitudinal patient data that we'll get that going, and then we'll expand from there. Oh, yes. We would not sell any raw data rights. We have a long time selling that caustic data network, that data platform, and we'll continue to do it and then build it. We use that for our internal use in our consulting group that may be used that, but then we'll use it to make products for customers, but it's not a type of thing where we would OEM or something like that. Thank you. Yes. Hi, Sterling. Thanks for your question. So, I mean, we're certainly keeping an eye on what is happening with the election and also what happens around legislation and policy as our customers, but the reality is, the industry is a big industry. It's a global industry. These kinds of things elections happen all the time. Legislation changes, policy changes all the time and it tends to be balanced out by a lot of the innovation that happens in the industry innovating a new medicines and really everybody focused on driving patient outcomes and doing the right thing for patients. So that's a long way to say that, some of these changes they tend to be a wash with the innovation. We haven't seen any impact yet on our customers, and we don't really expect any impact of some of those changes in the political landscape over the near-term either. Sterling, no new entrance that we're aware of; no change to the competitive dynamics, we're really replacing the client server there. I guess the only caveat is customers are seeing that Veeva has success in CTMS at scale at the large enterprise. So, that's sort of a de-risk for people, and I think many customers are thinking, \"When would I go to see the CTMS? When does it make sense to --\" because at this point I think they have the best alternative to the market and the proven solution. Thanks, Sterling. Thank you all for joining us today. I'd also like to extend a special thanks to Rick Lund for all his years of service and contributions at Veeva. This is Rick's last earnings call with us and we wish him well, and his next role as a CFO, and I wish you all a happy holiday season, and we look forward to talking with you next year. Thank you."

            "name": "Paul Shawah",
            "content": "Yes, Christopher, thanks. This is Paul. So, yes, we're really pleased. The 19 that Peter referenced was 19 net new CRM wins, so this is in a core CRM space, and we're seeing that really great strength in our U.S. SMB market. So these are -- many of them are pre-commercial companies, companies that are looking to launch. Others are those that are on a legacy CRM system, and they're choosing Veeva. And I think there's a couple of things that are driving this. One is the industry is looking to become more digital and more efficient, and they trust Veeva as the partner to get them there, because we've delivered on that over the last several months and over several years really. And I think the other thing is just the trust in Veeva as a strategic partner. So they need to get to digital quicker and relying on Veeva as a partner to get them there, so great momentum in CRM. We've had -- and so specifically those are kind of net new CRM wins. We do, in fact. So what is typically happening today, which is different than, let's say, two -- one or two or even three years ago is companies that three or four years ago may have come in looking for a CRM system, and they walked away with CRM and maybe one or two add-ons. What is more common today is they're looking for a broader and more strategic partner, and they're buying more products upfront, so certainly Veeva CRM and then many add-ons at the same time. Typically, all of the digital add-ons like Approved Email and Engage, they're just -- they're looking to go more digital much faster. So we are seeing uptick in CRM, but also the related add-ons as well. Yes, it's going really well. And as evidenced by some of the numbers, first and foremost, we talked about the net new -- the record number of net new CRM wins. As a start, I would say, the overall dynamics are roughly the same, meaning, we continue to win most deals. We're increasing market share. The one thing that has changed in the competitive landscape is, over the last quarter, is we've had two replacements of IQVIA's new OCE product. So that's the product that they built on Salesforce.com, it's been out in the marketplace for a couple years now. That's a new dynamic for us that hasn't happened before.  And what we're seeing across the market is that companies are trying it. It hasn't met their expectations from a product or from a services standpoint, and they're looking to get the digital by looking to a partner that can execute and that that they can trust. So, we have -- we've had those two replacements, and I expect that those will -- those are hard, they take time. But I'm expecting those will -- we'll see more and more of those over time. Yes, I'll give some commentary on that. First, the overall 10% number, so the way that we think about that is really based on multiple conversations with customers. We're always in very strategic discussions with customers, and thinking about what the future of the sales force looks like, but also based on Veeva estimates as well, it's what we believe as we look out at the market, and we help the industry become more efficient and more digital. This move to digital is really, really good for Veeva. So as we're -- as companies adopt more and more of the products in Veeva Commercial Cloud, including products like Approved Email and Engage, they become more efficient, and we're trying to drive that, we're embracing that shift. And you'll also see that shift in our innovation. So as we -- we're trying to accelerate it with new products, like MyVeeva for Doctors, helping the industry get to digital faster and more efficiently. So we have, I guess, maybe the one bigger point to think about is we've -- we're super confident in the targets still for 2025, because we've always contemplated some level of reduction. We're just -- what we're seeing is that the reduction is happening a little bit at an accelerated pace compared to where we thought it would be because the industry is moving to digital faster. Yes. So when I was referencing companies that have turned on free Engage and will continue to renew, and that will end up being the larger contribution. When you look at the overall size of the engaged market, the bump that we'll see this year will be larger than the bump that we see next year, and even perhaps the year beyond that as well, because many of our customers have turned on for Engage, and we expect the majority of them to continue with a renewable. So we'll see a significant increase of this year, and then, and over time more of our customers, those same companies will expand their usage of Engage, but also net new companies will happen as well, the companies that haven't turned on Engage yet for whatever reason, will start to turn it on over time."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Rick Lund, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nRick Lund: Good afternoon, and welcome to Veeva\u2019s fiscal 2021 second quarter earnings call for the quarter ended July 31, 2020. With me on today\u2019s call are Peter Gassner, our Chief Executive Officer; Paul Shawah, SVP of Commercial Cloud; and Tim Cabral, our Chief Financial Officer. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding trends, our strategies and the anticipated performance of the business. These forward-looking statements will be based on management\u2019s current views and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those related to the impacts of COVID-19 on our business, the life sciences industry and global economic conditions. Our actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the risks listed in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our most recent filing on Form 10-Q, which is available on the company\u2019s website at veeva.com under the Investors section and on the SEC\u2019s website at sec.gov. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today, August 27, 2020 based on the facts available to us today. If this call is replayed or viewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Veeva disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today\u2019s call, but we\u2019ll not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. The guidance we will provide today is in part based on our current assumptions as to the macroeconomic environment in which we will be operating in the future, including the timing and pace of recovery from any negative effects caused by COVID-19. Such matters that are beyond our control and our assumptions may not be correct and may change rapidly. On the call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today\u2019s earnings release and in the supplemental investor presentation, both of which are available on our website. A reconciliation can also be found as an exhibit to the Form 8-K filed with the SEC just before this call. With that, thank you for joining us. And I will turn it over to Peter.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you, Rick, and welcome, everyone, joining us today. Q2 is a strong quarter. Total revenue was $354 million, up 33% year-over-year. Subscription revenue grew 31% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating margin was 41%. We\u2019re also raising our full-year total revenue guidance to $1,420 million on the top end, which is above the initial guidance we provided in March. This reflects improved visibility into the back-half of the year and now that we\u2019ve had more time to understand how the life sciences industry is adapting to COVID-19. Our life sciences customers reported that the second quarter was as expected with fewer patient visits, delayed procedures and the reversal of Q1 stockpiling. They see some areas improving and are more optimistic as they look to the second-half. More clinical trials are starting back up as clinical research sites reopen. Of the studies that were disrupted, roughly half have now restarted. Crossix data shows an in-office patient visits are trending up from a low of 52% of pre-COVID levels to 84% at the end of July. At the same time, telehealth visits are at 10% of total visits. While this is down from a peak of 30% a few months ago, it is significantly higher than the 1% before the pandemic. Overall, the industry is rethinking their approach to digital and this aligns well with our current offerings and future strategy. One of the newer areas that\u2019s created a lot of excitement is MyVeeva. MyVeeva is the overall brand for our two consumer-facing applications. One targeted to patients in clinical trials and one for doctors. This is an important new territory for Veeva and for the industry as we provide better ways for our customers to serve patients and doctors online. I talked about MyVeeva for clinical trials on our last earnings call, and this quarter, I will give an update on MyVeeva for Doctors. We announced MyVeeva for Doctors at Veeva Commercial Summit in June. MyVeeva for Doctors is a website and mobile application to make it easier for doctors to connect with life sciences. It will provide a single place, where doctors can go to get information, services and contact directly from life sciences companies in the standard easy-to-use format. Today, there is no single place for doctors to go for this. MyVeeva for Doctors has the potential to be a game changer. This product will be available at the end of the year for the U.S. market, and we\u2019re currently in discussions with a handful of potential early adopters. This type of innovation and product leadership in commercial has allowed us to expand our position as a strategic partner to the industry and gain market share. We recently won two significant CRM deals for the domestic teams with large Japanese pharma company. Veeva Approved Email and Veeva Engage Meeting usage is increasing and our virtual events business in the Physicians World is gaining momentum. Overall, customers are looking to Veeva as they define their digital engagement strategy. They appreciate the partnership we\u2019ve provided since the earliest days of pandemic, with Veeva teams going the extra mile, our product innovation and our support with programs like free Engage Meetings, which we have extended now through the end of the year. In the data area, I also wanted to provide a quick update on Veeva Data Cloud. We\u2019re now working with three early adopters for our U.S. longitudinal patient data. This is our first Data Cloud offering and general availability is targeted for December. Leadership in the data market will take many years. But we\u2019re confident in our strategy and encouraged by early progress. The market needs innovation and now alternative to the legacy provider. Looking ahead in commercial, I have never been more excited. We are well-positioned for the future and continue to increase our leadership position as we bring real innovation and partnership to our customers. Before I move to Vault, a brief update on our antitrust trial against IQVIA. For years, IQVIA has used illegal tactics to maintain their data monopoly and leverage that monopoly could benefit their software business. This harms customers, patients and Veeva. Commercial Cloud products impacted include Veeva Network, Nitro and Andi. We filed our antitrust case in 2017 and we remain confident in our case. Due to COVID-19-related court delays, we now expect the case to go to trial near the end of 2022. On the Vault side, customers increasingly look to Veeva as they work to streamline drug development. We are seeing this across every area of Veeva Development Cloud. Vault QualityDocs and Vault QMS, both had record quarters. Two top 20 pharma selected QMS and one top 20 selected QualityDocs as their enterprise standards. It was also a great quarter for regulatory. The top 20 pharma made the decision to adopt a full RIM suite and another top 20 will deploy Vault registrations globally. Momentum is building in clinical as well. This is one of the areas of greatest need for our customers to modernize. For instance, in CTMS, which is the heart of clinical operations technology, we had an outstanding quarter. We now have more than 70 Vault CTMS customers in just three years since we released the product. In the second quarter, we had our first go live with a top 20, added another top 20 and signed our first top seven CRO. We also had CTMS pilot started two additional top 20 pharma. We\u2019re also making good progress on the clinical data side. More than 100 studies have now started on Vault CDMS. Customers appreciate the innovation and agility that Veeva CDMS brings, as well as the benefit of the integration with Vault eTMF and Vault CTMS. In the quarter, we had a win with a second top 20 pharma, who will run a handful of complex oncology trials on CDMS. If successful, this could lead to a broader deployment. I\u2019m really excited about clinical. Our leadership position in clinical operations continues to expand. We\u2019re making great progress in clinical data, and there\u2019s a lot of interest in MyVeeva for clinical trials. Clinical is a large area and it\u2019s all coming together nicely. Finally, I\u2019d like to share an update on our efforts outside of life sciences. The industries we serve continue to be impacted by the pandemic. But I\u2019m encouraged by the success we\u2019re having with existing customers who continue to expand their use of Veeva. For instance, the top CPG company will replace an established incumbent with our quality applications across all their business units. Additionally, we continue to make progress with new customers. The top 20 agrichemicals business has selected regulatory solutions as their enterprise standard. Overall, the team had a strong quarter and is executing well. Before closing, I want to give special thanks to Tim. This is his last earnings call with us, and I\u2019m grateful for his many years of partnership. Tim is staying with Veeva on a part-time basis going forward as an advisor and mentor to the Veeva team. Finally, I\u2019d like to acknowledge all of the Veeva employees for their innovation and creativity to come up with new and better ways to continue to support customers. And I\u2019d like to thank our customers for their tireless efforts to fight this pandemic and to improve the lives of patients around the globe. I\u2019m looking forward to deepening Veeva\u2019s partnership with our customers for many years to come. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tim.\nTim Cabral: Thanks, Peter. As Peter mentioned, the life sciences industry remains relatively healthy overall, and our customers are confident in their outlook for the second-half of the year. After working through key business continuity projects in the spring, many of our customers have refocused on core operations and continue to make technology investments to support long-term growth. Against this industry backdrop, we saw strong demand across our product portfolio in Q2. Commercial Vault had a great quarter and QualityDocs had its strongest bookings performance ever. We saw increased uptake for products like QMS and CTMS, which are gaining broader adoption. In addition, services demand was particularly resilient in R&D across a range of implementations of Veeva Development Cloud applications. Taken together, these factors help drive meaningful revenue outperformance in Q2. Strong demand also drove our bookings outperformance, which, coupled with our strong services demand, resulted in a calculated billings total that was $25 million above our guidance for the quarter. This included subscription deals closed in Q2, which were expected later in the year. Calculated billings also benefited from better-than-expected billing duration for the new business closed in Q2 and fewer-than-expected customer requests for billings changes. Another dynamic that shaped the quarter was the favorable hiring environment for Veeva. We added a record 357 net new employees in Q2. Our hiring was boosted by the new class of Generation Veeva, our university hiring program that primarily feeds our product and services teams. We are committed to investing in the business and have an aggressive hiring plan for the back-half of the year. Additionally, in Q2, operating margin saw 250 basis points benefit from travel-related cost savings and lower customer event expenses. Given the ongoing uncertainty around the pandemic, we expect to see continued cost savings in these areas for the rest of the year, although not quite at this level of benefit. Turning to guidance. Our outlook is informed by the improving environment for our customers and continued growing demand for our products and services. Though as we discussed last quarter, we remain mindful of certain customer segments and industry dynamics that continue to face COVID-19-related headwinds. Please note that combined, these segments represent a small portion of our overall business. For the full-year, we now expect total revenue to be $1,415 million to $1,420 million. This increase brings our full-year guidance ahead of the outlook we provided during our fourth quarter call back in early March. Subscription revenue is expected to be about $1,155 million for the full-year. Commercial Cloud subscription revenue is anticipated to be roughly $585 million, with the Crossix contribution unchanged at $76 million to $78 million. Meanwhile, full-year Vault subscription revenue is expected to be roughly $570 million. While the headlines we saw in Q1 somewhat persisted with Crossix and Physicians World, both performed in line with our expectations for the second quarter. Advertising spend is rebounding and virtual events are starting to see momentum. But neither of these businesses are near pre-COVID-19 levels. So our full-year total revenue guidance of $90 million to $95 million remains unchanged. Our full-year non-GAAP operating income is projected to be between $540 million and $545 million, a non-GAAP operating margin of roughly 38%. Full-year EPS is expected to be $2.64 to $2.67 on a fully diluted share count of approximately $163 million. Looking ahead, we\u2019ve revised our full-year calculated billings up to $1,500 million from $1,480 million, the high end of our previous guidance. We anticipate calculated billings of about $245 million for the third quarter. Please remember that there are numerous factors that make year-over-year comparisons of this metric highly variable on a quarterly basis. Therefore, we do not believe it is a good indicator of the underlying momentum of our business and we do not manage to it internally. Our subscription revenue guidance and calculated billings guidance for the full-year are the best indicators of our momentum. We are also raising our guidance for full-year cash flow from operations, excluding the excess tax benefit to $475 million, up from $450 million previously based upon the strong demand we are seeing in our expected full-year billings. For Q3, total revenue is expected to be $360 million to $362 million, with subscription revenue contributing about $295 million. Non-GAAP operating income is projected to be $138 million to $140 million and non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.66 to $0.68 based on a fully diluted share count of approximately $163 million. Before I close, I would like to take a moment to express my thanks. First, I want to thank Peter, Matt and the Board for giving me this amazing opportunity and entrusting me with the role of CFO. Thanks to our leadership team for being great partners over the past 11 years, and the entire Veeva team for the incredible execution, spirit of innovation and teamwork and always living our values. Lastly, I would like to thank my team for their focus on excellence in the work they do every day. Today, I\u2019m as bullish as ever for the opportunity Veeva has in front of it, and the impact we\u2019re making with our customers in such a mission-critical industry. I\u2019m extremely confident I\u2019m leaving Veeva in capable hands with Brent and my leadership team. Thanks for joining us today. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Brad Sills with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills: Oh, great. Thanks, guys, and, Tim, congratulations on your new role. You\u2019ll be missed. You\u2019ve been a big help over the years.\nTim Cabral: Thanks, Brad.\nBrad Sills: Yes, absolutely. So my question is really just on CDMS and clinical. Obviously, you had a large \u2013 it sounds like top 20 deal there. I know the focus has been on kind of building the referenceability and the feature set to go after that category. Do you feel like you\u2019re kind of there at this point? Should we expect more of these kinds of deals coming for CDMS?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. Brad, I\u2019ll take that one. Yes, these are complex areas, clinical. I do feel that, we\u2019re incrementally growing the business, yes. The product is getting more mature. We\u2019re getting some more reference customers. It\u2019s early. Still in CDMS, it\u2019s early. It\u2019s a big broad area, but I feel like we\u2019re on the right track. The core of CDMS, the electronic data capture part is starting to become pretty mature in its product, but there\u2019s a lot of new things in clinical, too, like MyVeeva for clinical trials. So we\u2019re doing well. I\u2019m really happy with it.\nBrad Sills: That\u2019s great. Thanks. Thanks so much, Peter. And then outside life sciences, chemical win here, it sounds like agrochemical, is that the first of its kind in this industry? I know you\u2019ve previously talked about CPG and cosmetics. Should we view that as a potential catalyst for that segment of the outside life sciences?\nPeter Gassner: Outside life sciences, I would say, our two strongest verticals, CPG and cosmetics. We do have some chemicals, including some agrochemicals. We have a handful of agrochemical customers now. So \u2013 but I would \u2013 nothing has changed there. I would say, CPG and cosmetics is still our main focus.\nBrad Sills: Got it. Great. Thanks so much, Peter.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from with Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is open.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions here. And let me echo my congrats here for you, Tim.\nTim Cabral: Thank you, sir.\nSaket Kalia: Maybe \u2013 sure. Maybe first for you, Peter. Can you just talk a little bit about what you think is driving the increased adoption of quality? Is this something where more reference customer success is maybe helping to broaden that adoption? Or is there something else you feel like is prompting customers to replace what they were using before in favor of something like Veeva Quality?\nPeter Gassner: It\u2019s a great question. I think there\u2019s a number of factors. I couldn\u2019t point to exactly one, but it\u2019s a combination of \u2013 we\u2019ve now filled out the suite. We have QualityDocs for the SOP management. We have the Quality Management System for the CAPAs deviations, those types of things and we also have training, all in one unified platform. Nobody had that before. So it was a little bit hard for customers to understand at first. Now people are early \u2013 seeing early adopters do it. That\u2019s creating a lot of interest. I think, actually, COVID provides us a little bit of boost, because it\u2019s okay, everybody in the life sciences, there\u2019s more need to access things remotely and we perform. That\u2019s one thing about Vault. It performs exceedingly fast promote. We measure the performance from the end users browser time, and that\u2019s all around the world. The average time to view a document is less than 1.5 seconds. That\u2019s unheard of, of their existing systems. So these things are providing momentum. But one thing to know, quality is maybe our most conservative customer segment, very conservative. So the fact that we\u2019re moving fast in this conservative segment is really outstanding.\nSaket Kalia: That\u2019s great. Maybe for my follow-up for you, Tim. Can you just talk a little bit about what look like healthier professional services gross margin, I imagine some of that is maybe from things like higher utilization, maybe some more remote engagements. But I\u2019m curious maybe how Physicians World is impacting that, if at all?\nTim Cabral: Yes. I think you\u2019ve hit the head \u2013 the nail on the head in terms of the two primary drivers to what we saw in terms of professional services margin this quarter. Just to recap, strong demand leading to really strong utilization. And at the same time, we really don\u2019t have any travel costs in a business that has a bit of travel most of the time, Saket. So you see the bottom line benefit of that in our services gross margin. Physicians World, while, as I said, they did in line with what we expected. It really doesn\u2019t move the needle in terms of the size of that business relative to the overall size of our professional services. But they did well in Q2.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Next question is from Tom Roderick with Stifel. Your line is open.\nTom Roderick: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I appreciate it. And, Tim, we\u2019ll miss you. It\u2019s been fantastic working with you. So best of luck on the next adventures for you. I guess, the question, I\u2019d love to dive in a little bit deeper and, Peter, you can kind of handle this. As you think about the big picture that\u2019s going on with spending trends and then the big picture that\u2019s going on with net new trials and activity across the space. Obviously, the strategic picture looking at one to three years is very favorable. In the near-term, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some caution about when do we pull the trigger on net new purchases and IT. Can you just kind of talk about how the strategic conversations you\u2019re having with buyers are thinking longer-term and manifesting themselves more near-term with respect to your portfolio and particularly interested on how that sort of plays out on the Vault side?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. Tom, I think, high level, important to know life sciences as a long \u2013 their long view on these things could take 10 years to bring the drug to market, product has a 20-year life cycle. So they have a long-term view to start with, and that hasn\u2019t changed. There \u2013 we don\u2019t see project delays or anything like that. We do see customers sometimes shift priorities a little bit. They may have COVID-related emergencies, which might relate to Veeva or non-Veeva. And when they relate to Veeva, that caused a little burst of business for us. When it relates to non-Veeva, that might delay one of our existing projects. So \u2013 but all in all, it\u2019s good. They\u2019re looking for efficiency and digital. So I think it\u2019s very \u2013 it\u2019s a very good thing for us and it feels nice and steady. It feels to me like life sciences has totally found their way and is comfortable with COVID. They know they have to contribute majorly for society and it\u2019s causing this burst of innovation and they can see their way through it.\nTom Roderick: Yes, fantastic. That\u2019s great. And you\u2019ve shown some enthusiasm now for a couple of quarters on MyVeeva, really excited to hear that, that\u2019s coming out later in the year. Can you sort of share with us how that might play out from a modeling perspective, or even just a pricing perspective to how customers will pay for this and users can access it? So thinking about one side of this being access for clinical trial patients and then the other side for doctors. Take us through how this plays out in the model. And then the go-to-market on this as you start to roll this out at the end of the year?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. We\u2019re very excited about it, and you\u2019re right. It\u2019s new for Veeva, right? These are the applications for consumers, patients in clinical trials and doctors. In terms of the model, we won\u2019t be charging the doctors or the patients directly for that, right? That\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ll monetize that through providing benefit for life sciences. And then as far as the details of exactly how and when and size of that, it\u2019s just a little bit too early to go into that, where we\u2019re really forming the product with our early adopters. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll focus on customer success first. There\u2019s a tremendous amount of value there and we\u2019ll be able to monetize that in a reasonable way as we go forward.\nTom Roderick: Great. Fantastic. We look forward to more in that. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nPeter Gassner: Thanks, Tom.\nOperator: Next question is from Stephanie Davis with SVB Leerink. Your line is open.\nStephanie Davis Demko: Hey, guys, congrats on the quarter and let me echo them. Congrats on a well-deserved move on. So I was hoping you could dive in a little bit deeper into the new wins for longitudinal patient data. Were they de novo or competitive takeaways? And what pushed these clients over the finish line, given it\u2019s relatively new introduction?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. The longitudinal patient data, I\u2019ll take that one. This is Peter. These were not takeaways. These were \u2013 I guess, they\u2019re competitive, that\u2019s for sure. They \u2013 these were people that were looking to analyze patient data to answer some questions that they hadn\u2019t been able to answer before. So they\u2019re specific to a brand. So they would have looked at other data sets and decided to go with ours, partly because they have strong partnerships with Veeva and they\u2019re looking for innovation. They\u2019re unsatisfied with the data sets that they get today. Well, maybe that\u2019s too strong, maybe not unsatisfied. They feel like there\u2019s something better out there. So they\u2019re going along on this journey with us. But the main thing to know about the early adopters, the main thing is not the sale. It\u2019s the partnership and the working together to help improve and shape the early product. That\u2019s what I\u2019m really excited about. We\u2019re getting feedback. It\u2019s just invaluable from these early adopters.\nStephanie Davis Demko: Understood. And then pivoting a bit to the reiterate guidance for Crossix and Physicians World, just with the pandemic continuing longer than many of us expected. Have you found any alternative ways to monetize and grow the virtual events business just given events are still ongoing?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. We\u2019re pretty bullish on that. So we have some uptick in business in the virtual events. And I think that\u2019s something we\u2019re looking forward to partnering with our customers as they go forward, because they\u2019re \u2013 yes, everybody is realizing that, a, pandemic is here a little longer than we initially expected and the power of digital is really being impressed on people. So we\u2019re pretty excited about our plans there.\nStephanie Davis Demko: Okay, understood. Thank you for that update.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joe Vruwink with Baird. Your line is open.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Hello, everyone, and also extend my best wishes to Tim. Peter, I wanted to go back to your comments on never being more excited around the commercial suite. And I guess, are there things when you refer to just life science customers having more visibility within the last couple of months? Are there things about Veeva\u2019s visibility into particular areas of commercial where maybe there\u2019s some things, which actually are driving the comment that you\u2019ve never been more excited? And you touched on a few things, virtual events and maybe the ability to integrate that into Engage and create this broader set of products that, that maybe is one area. But if you could just dive into maybe any specific things that are perhaps new in the last few months?\nPeter Gassner: Well, my planning horizon or the things I get excited about are usually a little longer-term, right? So 2025 is my focus. And I would say, that\u2019s what I\u2019m excited about. I feel like, commercial, we\u2019re going to add a ton of value to our customers as we go towards 2025, and it\u2019s a combination of things. One is, I feel like we have potential to really do impactful things here in digital, not only with Engage, but with MyVeeva and with virtual events. So that is pure technology-based value that is added to the customers on the commercial side. And then the data, Data Cloud, that\u2019s a very large market, very strategic. And I can see the innovation we\u2019re bringing and the feedback from the early customers. So that\u2019s also important. And then the partnership, how the partnership in basically the pandemic in this time of stress is causing Veeva and our customers to get closer together. And I would say just the last thing, the hiring, not only the experienced hiring, but the awesome new graduates that we\u2019re bringing into the company and teaching them the right way and our policies and procedures around that. So, sometimes you work really hard and things come together and the timing is right, and maybe there\u2019s some sprinkling of good luck. But I\u2019m just optimistic about our future.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I want to shift gears and have a question on profitability. With Veeva already being back above the 40% kind of high watermark. Are there things other than you touched on professional service margins already, other things beyond just the strong top line performance providing greater leverage? Because as you brought up, you\u2019re still doing a good amount of hiring. And I\u2019m curious, are there other upside drivers in the model?\nTim Cabral: Yes. Hey, Joe, this is Tim. The other area that we saw benefit in the quarter to the tune of about 250 basis points was the fact that we had very little travel-related expenses and we moved all of our customer events to virtual. So those both materially impacted \u2013 well, to the tune of 250 basis points impacted the operating margin performance for Q2. As we look out in the year and given the uncertainty of the pandemic, we do expect savings across those two expense lines, Joe, to continue, not at the level we saw likely in Q2, probably a little bit less than that.\nJoe Vruwink: That is helpful. Thank you, both.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan Chase and Co. Your line is open.\nSterling Auty: Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. Tim, congratulations on a great tenure. I\u2019m just kind of curious if you could answer a question I\u2019m getting frequently from investors, just to level set Veeva. As you think about COVID-19, investors are looking at Vault and wondering how many new Vaults might be starting up just to support COVID research? And how many of the clinical trials you might be benefiting from? So they\u2019re looking for, is there a way to quantify the COVID-19 benefits that you might be seeing?\nPeter Gassner: Hey, Sterling, it\u2019s Peter. I\u2019ll take that one. I don\u2019t have exact numbers for you. A very small portion of our work is specific to COVID-19. Now, it\u2019s important and it\u2019s strategic. And so we\u2019ve done clinical trial work, where the team has had to really hustle and work that we can and our technologies really help. But in terms of business or financial, it\u2019s a very small portion. COVID-19 overall is very important. But if you look at life sciences overall, it\u2019s a small portion of life sciences revenue.\nSterling Auty: Great. And then one quick follow-ups. The MyVeeva for Doctors. Can you give us what do you think is going to be the biggest use case? A high level, I understand, I think, its intention. But what do you expect the biggest use case to be for that solution?\nPaul Shawah: Hey, Sterling, this is\u2026\nPeter Gassner: Yes, Paul, why don\u2019t you take that one? Yes.\nPaul Shawah: Yes. I want to take that one. All right. So this is Paul, Sterling. Thanks for the question. Yes, I mean, this is a really \u2013 it\u2019s a really significant one. It\u2019s a different approach to digital. What we\u2019re doing here I view this as a platform that\u2019s going to lead us and lead the industry and kind of that kind of next direction and next day innovation in digital space. If you think about the problem that it\u2019s solving and most doctors, they deal with multiple different pharma companies. And from those pharma companies, they probably are dealing with multiple different brands. Every pharma company would love to be in the pocket of every HCP, accessible via an app or accessible via website. But when you multiply that out, it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s a \u2013 the law of large numbers takes any, you end up with the fact that it\u2019s too complex for the doctor. They can\u2019t be able to engage digitally with so many different companies, because they\u2019d have to download so many apps. They have to go to so many different websites, remember so many different passwords. We\u2019re putting all of that into one place. We\u2019re making it really easy for the doctor to access the entire industry, all in one place on an app, or on a website. And we\u2019re building it around. We\u2019re doing digital differently from the standpoint that there\u2019s a human relationship involved. There\u2019s a human being, the rep or the medical science liaison or some person from the life sciences company who is creating a connection with the HCP. And what that means is, once they create a connection, they\u2019re able to do certain things. They\u2019re able to chat, they\u2019re able to share information, they\u2019re able to request samples. So as we talk about this with our \u2013 with some prospective early customers, we\u2019ve had a ton of interest as \u2013 after we\u2019ve announced this. They\u2019re real interested in use cases of secure communication. So how do they interact with customers in a secure way that is compliant. So things like a text message may not be so compliant. But doing it via MyVeeva would be, they\u2019re looking to do things like schedule more Engage Meetings with them. They\u2019re looking for ways to be accessible by that doctor to do things like requesting samples on their own terms. So really, the big problem that we\u2019re solving is, we\u2019re making it easy for the doctor to access life sciences when and how they want to and to enhance the relationship that they have with their reps. That\u2019s really the way to think about it.\nSterling Auty: Excellent. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Next question is from Ken Wong with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Ken Wong with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nKen Wong: Oh, sorry about that, mute. You guys have previously focused primarily just on pharma biotech customers? Should we view MyVeeva as sort of a one-off push into consumer? Or do you guys have grander aspirations to expand into that particular market?\nPaul Shawah: Yes. So this is an interesting one. When doctors think about their practice and the products that they use to for their patients, they don\u2019t necessarily think, hey, this is just pharma or just med device or they think about the full portfolio of products that, that could be applicable to their patients. Now, which could lead us down a path over time for us to enabling us as a solution for HEPs that are able to interact more broadly with life sciences companies, but consumer and med device. Having said that, that\u2019s certainly a long-term play and something that we would \u2013 a long-term vision that we would grow into. The focus for us today is purely on the life sciences companies. Remember, what we\u2019re doing here is, life sciences is our customer. We\u2019re enabling a lot of the capabilities and the processes that they have or that they need to improve. That\u2019s really our focus. But there is some potential longer-term and \u2013 but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re thinking about today. We\u2019re really thinking about the pure life sciences, traditional pharma, biotech customer that we serve.\nKen Wong: Great. Thanks, Paul. And then, Tim, can\u2019t let you leave without asking you a question. As we think about the 3Q calculated billings guide, 245, I guess, look, a little light of Street. Help us understand, I guess, how much of that is maybe a pull forward into Q2? I think you mentioned early signings. Any potential kind of realignments or kind of one-off things we should be aware of in terms of the seasonality in the back-half?\nTim Cabral: Yes. Hey, Ken. So those are the two drivers there in terms of a bit of pull forward of deals we thought we\u2019re going to close in Q3 got pulled into Q2. And then the other thing we talked about in the last two quarters is a better billing duration in Q1 and Q2, which means that those underlying seasonal renewal basis in Q1 and Q2 increase at the expense of the Q3 seasonal renewal base. So compared to last year, Q2 renewal base, we\u2019re seeing it slightly lower, as we see a little bit more movement towards Q1 and Q2.\nKen Wong: Got it. Thanks for the color.\nTim Cabral: Yep, Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nRishi Jaluria: Hey, guys, thanks so much for taking my questions. And, Tim, I echo everyone else and wishing you the best and it\u2019s been a great pleasure working with you over the years. I want to start by asking about virtual conferences. So you had a few of them, if I\u2019m not mistaken, commercial and whatnot. Given how referenceability is so important to the Veeva way of having customers share best \u2013 use cases with each other and best practices. How has it been from having virtual conferences and being able to have some level of referenceability in networking and being able to replicate that in a virtual environment? And then I\u2019ve got a follow-up.\nPeter Gassner: It\u2019s working well. It\u2019s working well. There are pros and cons. First, I do recognize we have good relationships with our customers and those are developed largely in the face-to-face day. So to some extent, we\u2019re utilizing that. We wouldn\u2019t \u2013 maybe are we \u2013 is it more difficult to develop new relationships in the virtual world? I think it is a bit. Now, having said that, we\u2019re on the same footing with everyone else. So I think they\u2019re getting used to that and we\u2019re executing very well on our events. But we\u2019re looking forward to seeing our customers in person again.\nRishi Jaluria: Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then \u2013 and, Tim, when you quantify the 200 bps of savings from effectively $0 of T&E and not having physical events. And I appreciate that you\u2019re quantifying that. I think you\u2019re the first I\u2019ve seen in software to actually try to put a number on that. But going even beyond this year, so we think post-COVID, if things do return back to something resembling normal, how sustainable are these levels of cost savings? In other words, is there kind of a more permanent shift to doing virtual selling in certain cases doing virtual implementations and training versus, again, doing that in person? Just how do we think about the sustainability of some of the cost savings that we\u2019re realizing right now in this environment?\nTim Cabral: Yes. Rishi, I certainly don\u2019t want to lean into any guidance for next year. But I think \u2013 I do think you\u2019re hitting on a point in terms of the way we will work in the future. You heard Peter just talk about \u2013 you asked him the question about our customer events, and we certainly enjoy the engagement with our customers when we\u2019re face-to-face with them. And I would imagine, our plan is to move those back to what they were before. On the travel side, I do think that you\u2019re going to see some benefit. And I would say that across all companies, you\u2019re going to see some benefit, because during this time, companies have had to get incredibly effective at using virtual means to connect. Does that save \u2013 instead of having three people travel to a customer, do you have one person and two people are connected via Zoom in the future? I think all those are possibilities. And I think we will benefit like other companies will benefit, albeit not to the extent we\u2019re certainly seeing during this pandemic time.\nRishi Jaluria: Great. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Stan Zlotsky with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nStan Zlotsky: Perfect. Thank you so much, guys. Well, one question at a very high level. It\u2019s been a little over a year since Metadata was acquired. What have you seen from them during that time? Because also in the meantime, you guys have managed to win two top 20 pharma in the Phase 3 \u2013 two customers since the acquisition. Maybe just qualitative comments on what you\u2019re seeing there? And have a quick follow-up.\nPeter Gassner: Stan, it\u2019s Peter. Metadata is a strong competitor. They are the leader by market share in the space. We have not seen honestly a lot of change as it results to the acquisition to really focus on our own area. And that\u2019s this innovation that\u2019s bringing the whole clinical suite together from clinic operations integrated tightly with clinical data management, things that we\u2019re doing with the clinical database and now MyVeeva for clinical trials. So I\u2019m not seeing particular changes from Metadata, they\u2019re still a strong competitor.\nStan Zlotsky: Okay, perfect. And just wanted to make sure that Tim was drilled appropriately on billings before he left. Hi, just following up on Ken\u2019s question, could you help us maybe quantify some of the pull-forward that you saw on billings into Q2? And also maybe some of the concessions that you guys talked about in Q1 and Q2, any quantification there? I would appreciate. Thank you.\nPeter Gassner: Sure. Stan, thanks for the question. So probably on the first one pull-forward, as it relates to billing, you\u2019re talking about in the few millions area, not more material than that. We went into the pandemic with probably a thought like most companies, Stan, that there would be some requests from our customers around cash flow and billings changes. There are \u2013 overall, we\u2019re not really seeing that very much. We didn\u2019t see it too much in back-half of Q1 and we didn\u2019t see it very much in Q2. Where we are seeing it is in some of the segments that I talked about, Stan, in the Q1 call some of the customer segments that we\u2019re seeing. But it\u2019s not as much as we would have expected, which I think is a testament to overall life sciences remains relatively healthy compared to other industries that other companies may be engaged with, Stan.\nStan Zlotsky: Got it. Thank you.\nPeter Gassner: Sure.\nOperator: Next question is from Brian Peterson with Raymond James. Your line is open. Brian Peterson with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nBrian Peterson: Oh, sorry, confused by the mute button, again, but congratulations on the results. And Tim, we will miss you on these calls absolutely. But \u2013 so just kind of \u2013 by the way, no billings questions for me. But just starting out on OLS, it sounds like you\u2019re adding to the customer base. I\u2019m just curious what you\u2019ve learned about some of the customers in the product fit and maybe competitive dynamics in those markets. And when we should we think about some accelerated go-to-market investments in outside of life sciences?\nPeter Gassner: Hi, Brian, this is Peter. I\u2019ll take that one. What we\u2019ve learned is, our products fit is really working where we\u2019re focusing the quality and the regulatory area, and we\u2019ve kind of honed our motion into these industries. In terms of go-to-market, that\u2019ll be gradual expansion as we go forward. Now remember, this cosmetics, CPG, it\u2019s a big market and our products in there are good. But this is a reasonable sized market. This is about as big as clinical data management markets inside life sciences. So we\u2019ll see steady increases, but nothing drastic.\nBrian Peterson: Understood. And maybe just one question as it relates to geographies, I know with COVID-19, I think, there\u2019s different trends across different markets. I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve seen that manifest in your business at all? Just looking to get more color on things by geography? Thanks, guys.\nPeter Gassner: Yes. By geography, I think, we\u2019re pretty steady. We haven\u2019t seen things. Now we see difference in interactions, right? In Asia, things have largely gone back to normal in many ways, visiting customers in person, employees getting together, U.S. not too much, mostly Europe not. But in terms of financial performance or business activity, no change to the geographic mix.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sandy Draper with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nSandy Draper: Thank you very much. Most of my questions have been asked. Maybe just a follow-up, this is probably for Paul. On the \u2013 on your comments around MyVeeva for Doctors, and you\u2019re talking about how pharma company can partner up and get the information. I\u2019m trying to understand is, if a doc has the app on a phone, and you have the four different pharma companies, are there four different instances of the app? Or I\u2019m just trying to understand logistically, I mean, it\u2019s a product setup where it\u2019s one product for the customer, for the doctor, but you can have however many pharma companies sign up pushing information and interacting with the customer, or how does that get separated out between the different Pharma companies?\nPaul Shawah: Yes. That\u2019s a good question. And that is precisely the magic, what you just described right there. In fact, it\u2019s one app on the device. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so powerful as one app and it\u2019s one website. And they can be invited by one company and create a connection and then they\u2019re on it. So one analogy, one thing that you might \u2013 you may think about from your everyday world is LinkedIn. Once you\u2019re on LinkedIn, you\u2019re on LinkedIn once, and you have one profile on there, and then you can start to connect with people. MyVeeva will have much of that same kind of model, where a doctor will get invited, they\u2019ll create and set up an account one-time, and then they\u2019ll be able to connect with anybody across all of life sciences through a single application. So that\u2019s precisely why it\u2019s different and why it\u2019s so unique in the industry, because nothing else really exists like that. And then that relationship \u2013 the reason why one of the things that we see pretty consistently is that, digital kind of pure digital standalone without a relationship versus digital combined with a relationship, the combination with the relationship, it\u2019s an order of magnitude more effective. So the perfect example for that is, when you look at the engagement rate with an e-mail sent by a human being, let\u2019s say, approved e-mail versus the engagement rate from a corporate home office, it\u2019s much, much higher with approved e-mail because of that relationship, and that\u2019s also another kind of key point with MyVeeva. It\u2019s combining digital with human relationships. So yes, really good, insightful question.\nPeter Gassner: Yes. Okay, pile on there. Like Sandy, one of the thing to think about is this amazing contact manager, you go in there and you search, you\u2019re searching for a brand, a company or a person and you find it and then you find all the things that are connected to that. That\u2019s the way to think about it. Absolutely kind of revolutionary really.\nSandy Draper: Got it. That\u2019s really helpful commentary from both of you, guys. And that\u2019s actually my only question. Don\u2019t have a follow-up. So I\u2019ll step back in the queue.\nPeter Gassner: Thanks, Sandy.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tyler Radke with Citi. Your line is open.\nTyler Radke: All right. Thanks very much. Peter, I think the question is for you. I wanted to ask about the CRO customer. I think you signed a CTMS deal with your first top seven CRO. And I believe a quarter ago, you were kind of a bit more cautious just on the CRO segment in general. Obviously, they were facing some kind of greater COVID headwinds in the rest of your customer base. But maybe just walk us through that selection process. How you kind of see the CRO opportunity where we are and how big that ultimately could evolve to?\nPeter Gassner: So CRO is very important for us, both, yes. They will use our software, but they\u2019re also a channel for, particularly for our clinical data management area, right? They would sometimes do clinical data management for customers small and large. Yes, we were a bit cautious on the CRO because of their business got hit by COVID, because they couldn\u2019t get out there, trials being stopped, that\u2019s a pretty immediate hit. In terms of this deal or more broadly CTMS in the CRO area, it\u2019s \u2013 they\u2019re doing it and this customer, in particular, doing it for increased efficiency. That\u2019s one. They have a lot of people. CTMS is the heartbeat of it. Their process and systems that they had before was not fast, it\u2019s not configurable, it\u2019s not user friendly, and they couldn\u2019t get the information out of it that they wanted to. So it\u2019s about efficiency. And the other part is they\u2019re realizing that Veeva is connecting things together into a clinical network, and our clinical data management system is quite promising. So there\u2019s a need for the CROs to be close to Veeva, unless they would like to, and some do, right? A couple try to develop their own technologies. But I think most are realizing that it\u2019s probably better to align with an industry standard technology, which Veeva is becoming.\nTyler Radke: Helpful. And my follow-up, I just wanted to better understand kind of the linearity or just business by \u2013 business trends by quarter. Obviously, it sounds like here in the second quarter, you saw a notable improvement from Q1 trends. But kind of curious if that was \u2013 there was kind of a step function, increase in any given quarter, or it\u2019s gradually increasing \u2013 improving trends by quarter and whether you\u2019ve seen that kind of continue to go up into the right through August so far?\nTim Cabral: And Tyler, this is Tim, by the way. Just so I\u2019m clear, are you talking about how the trends are shaping as \u2013 or during the pandemic? Is that what you\u2019re asking about specifically?\nTyler Radke: Yes. Just kind of business activity by quarter \u2013 or sorry, by month throughout your Q2 and then obviously now we\u2019re into your Q3, has that kind of continued if it was kind of steadily improving business trends?\nTim Cabral: Yes. I think that \u2013 I guess, I would say and, Peter, I don\u2019t know if you want to add to this. I guess, what I would say is, we really have never had a strong linearity in a quarter as you see some software companies have. We work with our customers and they engage with us and buy from us when they need new users, new products and the like. As it relates to the pandemic, there was probably a bit of a pause as customers and software companies like Veeva got used to the new way that we are going to work during this time, Tyler. And that was a short pause, I would say. And I would say, coming out of Q1 primarily into our Q2, we\u2019ve seen continued good demand. And I would say that continues into early August.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question comes from David Larsen with Verity. Your line is open.\nDavid Larsen: Hi. Tim, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you had the best bookings quarter ever in one of your line items. Did I hear that correctly? And what was that line item, and what drove that performance? Thanks.\nTim Cabral: Yes. Sure, Dave. So, it was QualityDocs, which is in the Development Cloud area and the quality area. It is the content management-based application that focuses on all the documentation and documents needed to manage your quality environment within pharma. So very important part of the quality area. And I think it\u2019s a combination probably of a couple of things. One, this is an area that we have become the clear leader in, and I think you\u2019re seeing some enterprise companies leaning in as it\u2019s becoming a priority for them. And secondly, we\u2019ve seen quite a nice uptake in this area around the SMB market, the longer tail for the opportunity we have in front of us for the Development Cloud and products like this. So, combination of a couple of things and really underlining the fact that we\u2019re the leader in this area as we\u2019re moving forward.\nDavid Larsen: Okay. And then just one quick follow-up. For the MyVeeva for Docs, it\u2019s like great description on what that actually does, it sounds like there\u2019s a lot of value there. Can you talk about the patient side of it? Like patients can already sort of dial in and sort of record how they\u2019re responding to certain meds. They can already sort of record, I think, through the Internet, how they\u2019re responding to certain meds on a clinical trial. How does the MyVeeva for patient side work? And what sort of new and novel about that?\nPeter Gassner: MyVeeva for patients, they can do some things electronically. But, for example, well over 80% of just what\u2019s called the electronic consent, meaning, the patient giving their consent to medical procedures right through data, et cetera. About over 80% of that is done by paper, signatures and faxes. So, it\u2019s a really fragmented and there\u2019s quite a few different applications for quite a few of these different things. So, it\u2019s not a great world. It\u2019s much easier to buy something on amazon.com than it is to go through a clinical trial as a patient. And that\u2019s really what \u2013 that\u2019s what it\u2019s about bringing it all together for the patient.\nDavid Larsen: Okay. And just one last one. For IQVIA, where are you seeing them in the market most frequently? Like, where do you see them? And how do you compete with them most frequently in the market? Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: Yes. We primarily see IQVIA on the commercial side. We don\u2019t see them so often in the R&D space. The \u2013 given what they\u2019re kind of going to market with, they\u2019ve been \u2013 had a particular focus on, as you know, the data side within primarily focused on commercial and then also they announced some software applications in commercial. So, we tend to see them there most, but not so much in R&D.\nDavid Larsen: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And this does conclude the Q&A period. I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Peter for any closing remarks.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you, operator, I\u2019d like to take this time to say thank you again to Tim Cabral. When our Veeva venture started together, Tim was our part-time bookkeeper and Veeva was an infant. And now 13 years of partnership later, here we are, a company that\u2019s contributed in a major way to our customers, employees, investors and society in general. And throughout that, Tim has been steady and strong like a rock throughout the journey, and he has built an amazing team. So, Tim, you get my vote for CFO of the decade. Thank you, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. And I look forward to talking with you again at Investor Day online on October 29. Have a great evening. Goodbye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tim Cabral",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. As Peter mentioned, the life sciences industry remains relatively healthy overall, and our customers are confident in their outlook for the second-half of the year. After working through key business continuity projects in the spring, many of our customers have refocused on core operations and continue to make technology investments to support long-term growth. Against this industry backdrop, we saw strong demand across our product portfolio in Q2. Commercial Vault had a great quarter and QualityDocs had its strongest bookings performance ever. We saw increased uptake for products like QMS and CTMS, which are gaining broader adoption. In addition, services demand was particularly resilient in R&D across a range of implementations of Veeva Development Cloud applications. Taken together, these factors help drive meaningful revenue outperformance in Q2. Strong demand also drove our bookings outperformance, which, coupled with our strong services demand, resulted in a calculated billings total that was $25 million above our guidance for the quarter. This included subscription deals closed in Q2, which were expected later in the year. Calculated billings also benefited from better-than-expected billing duration for the new business closed in Q2 and fewer-than-expected customer requests for billings changes. Another dynamic that shaped the quarter was the favorable hiring environment for Veeva. We added a record 357 net new employees in Q2. Our hiring was boosted by the new class of Generation Veeva, our university hiring program that primarily feeds our product and services teams. We are committed to investing in the business and have an aggressive hiring plan for the back-half of the year. Additionally, in Q2, operating margin saw 250 basis points benefit from travel-related cost savings and lower customer event expenses. Given the ongoing uncertainty around the pandemic, we expect to see continued cost savings in these areas for the rest of the year, although not quite at this level of benefit. Turning to guidance. Our outlook is informed by the improving environment for our customers and continued growing demand for our products and services. Though as we discussed last quarter, we remain mindful of certain customer segments and industry dynamics that continue to face COVID-19-related headwinds. Please note that combined, these segments represent a small portion of our overall business. For the full-year, we now expect total revenue to be $1,415 million to $1,420 million. This increase brings our full-year guidance ahead of the outlook we provided during our fourth quarter call back in early March. Subscription revenue is expected to be about $1,155 million for the full-year. Commercial Cloud subscription revenue is anticipated to be roughly $585 million, with the Crossix contribution unchanged at $76 million to $78 million. Meanwhile, full-year Vault subscription revenue is expected to be roughly $570 million. While the headlines we saw in Q1 somewhat persisted with Crossix and Physicians World, both performed in line with our expectations for the second quarter. Advertising spend is rebounding and virtual events are starting to see momentum. But neither of these businesses are near pre-COVID-19 levels. So our full-year total revenue guidance of $90 million to $95 million remains unchanged. Our full-year non-GAAP operating income is projected to be between $540 million and $545 million, a non-GAAP operating margin of roughly 38%. Full-year EPS is expected to be $2.64 to $2.67 on a fully diluted share count of approximately $163 million. Looking ahead, we've revised our full-year calculated billings up to $1,500 million from $1,480 million, the high end of our previous guidance. We anticipate calculated billings of about $245 million for the third quarter. Please remember that there are numerous factors that make year-over-year comparisons of this metric highly variable on a quarterly basis. Therefore, we do not believe it is a good indicator of the underlying momentum of our business and we do not manage to it internally. Our subscription revenue guidance and calculated billings guidance for the full-year are the best indicators of our momentum. We are also raising our guidance for full-year cash flow from operations, excluding the excess tax benefit to $475 million, up from $450 million previously based upon the strong demand we are seeing in our expected full-year billings. For Q3, total revenue is expected to be $360 million to $362 million, with subscription revenue contributing about $295 million. Non-GAAP operating income is projected to be $138 million to $140 million and non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.66 to $0.68 based on a fully diluted share count of approximately $163 million. Before I close, I would like to take a moment to express my thanks. First, I want to thank Peter, Matt and the Board for giving me this amazing opportunity and entrusting me with the role of CFO. Thanks to our leadership team for being great partners over the past 11 years, and the entire Veeva team for the incredible execution, spirit of innovation and teamwork and always living our values. Lastly, I would like to thank my team for their focus on excellence in the work they do every day. Today, I'm as bullish as ever for the opportunity Veeva has in front of it, and the impact we're making with our customers in such a mission-critical industry. I'm extremely confident I'm leaving Veeva in capable hands with Brent and my leadership team. Thanks for joining us today. And now, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Thanks, Brad. Thank you, sir. Yes. I think you've hit the head \u2013 the nail on the head in terms of the two primary drivers to what we saw in terms of professional services margin this quarter. Just to recap, strong demand leading to really strong utilization. And at the same time, we really don't have any travel costs in a business that has a bit of travel most of the time, Saket. So you see the bottom line benefit of that in our services gross margin. Physicians World, while, as I said, they did in line with what we expected. It really doesn't move the needle in terms of the size of that business relative to the overall size of our professional services. But they did well in Q2. Yes. Hey, Joe, this is Tim. The other area that we saw benefit in the quarter to the tune of about 250 basis points was the fact that we had very little travel-related expenses and we moved all of our customer events to virtual. So those both materially impacted \u2013 well, to the tune of 250 basis points impacted the operating margin performance for Q2. As we look out in the year and given the uncertainty of the pandemic, we do expect savings across those two expense lines, Joe, to continue, not at the level we saw likely in Q2, probably a little bit less than that. Yes. Hey, Ken. So those are the two drivers there in terms of a bit of pull forward of deals we thought we're going to close in Q3 got pulled into Q2. And then the other thing we talked about in the last two quarters is a better billing duration in Q1 and Q2, which means that those underlying seasonal renewal basis in Q1 and Q2 increase at the expense of the Q3 seasonal renewal base. So compared to last year, Q2 renewal base, we're seeing it slightly lower, as we see a little bit more movement towards Q1 and Q2. Yep, Thank you. Yes. Rishi, I certainly don't want to lean into any guidance for next year. But I think \u2013 I do think you're hitting on a point in terms of the way we will work in the future. You heard Peter just talk about \u2013 you asked him the question about our customer events, and we certainly enjoy the engagement with our customers when we're face-to-face with them. And I would imagine, our plan is to move those back to what they were before. On the travel side, I do think that you're going to see some benefit. And I would say that across all companies, you're going to see some benefit, because during this time, companies have had to get incredibly effective at using virtual means to connect. Does that save \u2013 instead of having three people travel to a customer, do you have one person and two people are connected via Zoom in the future? I think all those are possibilities. And I think we will benefit like other companies will benefit, albeit not to the extent we're certainly seeing during this pandemic time. And Tyler, this is Tim, by the way. Just so I'm clear, are you talking about how the trends are shaping as \u2013 or during the pandemic? Is that what you're asking about specifically? Yes. I think that \u2013 I guess, I would say and, Peter, I don't know if you want to add to this. I guess, what I would say is, we really have never had a strong linearity in a quarter as you see some software companies have. We work with our customers and they engage with us and buy from us when they need new users, new products and the like. As it relates to the pandemic, there was probably a bit of a pause as customers and software companies like Veeva got used to the new way that we are going to work during this time, Tyler. And that was a short pause, I would say. And I would say, coming out of Q1 primarily into our Q2, we've seen continued good demand. And I would say that continues into early August. Yes. Sure, Dave. So, it was QualityDocs, which is in the Development Cloud area and the quality area. It is the content management-based application that focuses on all the documentation and documents needed to manage your quality environment within pharma. So very important part of the quality area. And I think it's a combination probably of a couple of things. One, this is an area that we have become the clear leader in, and I think you're seeing some enterprise companies leaning in as it's becoming a priority for them. And secondly, we've seen quite a nice uptake in this area around the SMB market, the longer tail for the opportunity we have in front of us for the Development Cloud and products like this. So, combination of a couple of things and really underlining the fact that we're the leader in this area as we're moving forward."

            "name": "Peter Gassner",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick, and welcome, everyone, joining us today. Q2 is a strong quarter. Total revenue was $354 million, up 33% year-over-year. Subscription revenue grew 31% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating margin was 41%. We're also raising our full-year total revenue guidance to $1,420 million on the top end, which is above the initial guidance we provided in March. This reflects improved visibility into the back-half of the year and now that we've had more time to understand how the life sciences industry is adapting to COVID-19. Our life sciences customers reported that the second quarter was as expected with fewer patient visits, delayed procedures and the reversal of Q1 stockpiling. They see some areas improving and are more optimistic as they look to the second-half. More clinical trials are starting back up as clinical research sites reopen. Of the studies that were disrupted, roughly half have now restarted. Crossix data shows an in-office patient visits are trending up from a low of 52% of pre-COVID levels to 84% at the end of July. At the same time, telehealth visits are at 10% of total visits. While this is down from a peak of 30% a few months ago, it is significantly higher than the 1% before the pandemic. Overall, the industry is rethinking their approach to digital and this aligns well with our current offerings and future strategy. One of the newer areas that's created a lot of excitement is MyVeeva. MyVeeva is the overall brand for our two consumer-facing applications. One targeted to patients in clinical trials and one for doctors. This is an important new territory for Veeva and for the industry as we provide better ways for our customers to serve patients and doctors online. I talked about MyVeeva for clinical trials on our last earnings call, and this quarter, I will give an update on MyVeeva for Doctors. We announced MyVeeva for Doctors at Veeva Commercial Summit in June. MyVeeva for Doctors is a website and mobile application to make it easier for doctors to connect with life sciences. It will provide a single place, where doctors can go to get information, services and contact directly from life sciences companies in the standard easy-to-use format. Today, there is no single place for doctors to go for this. MyVeeva for Doctors has the potential to be a game changer. This product will be available at the end of the year for the U.S. market, and we're currently in discussions with a handful of potential early adopters. This type of innovation and product leadership in commercial has allowed us to expand our position as a strategic partner to the industry and gain market share. We recently won two significant CRM deals for the domestic teams with large Japanese pharma company. Veeva Approved Email and Veeva Engage Meeting usage is increasing and our virtual events business in the Physicians World is gaining momentum. Overall, customers are looking to Veeva as they define their digital engagement strategy. They appreciate the partnership we've provided since the earliest days of pandemic, with Veeva teams going the extra mile, our product innovation and our support with programs like free Engage Meetings, which we have extended now through the end of the year. In the data area, I also wanted to provide a quick update on Veeva Data Cloud. We're now working with three early adopters for our U.S. longitudinal patient data. This is our first Data Cloud offering and general availability is targeted for December. Leadership in the data market will take many years. But we're confident in our strategy and encouraged by early progress. The market needs innovation and now alternative to the legacy provider. Looking ahead in commercial, I have never been more excited. We are well-positioned for the future and continue to increase our leadership position as we bring real innovation and partnership to our customers. Before I move to Vault, a brief update on our antitrust trial against IQVIA. For years, IQVIA has used illegal tactics to maintain their data monopoly and leverage that monopoly could benefit their software business. This harms customers, patients and Veeva. Commercial Cloud products impacted include Veeva Network, Nitro and Andi. We filed our antitrust case in 2017 and we remain confident in our case. Due to COVID-19-related court delays, we now expect the case to go to trial near the end of 2022. On the Vault side, customers increasingly look to Veeva as they work to streamline drug development. We are seeing this across every area of Veeva Development Cloud. Vault QualityDocs and Vault QMS, both had record quarters. Two top 20 pharma selected QMS and one top 20 selected QualityDocs as their enterprise standards. It was also a great quarter for regulatory. The top 20 pharma made the decision to adopt a full RIM suite and another top 20 will deploy Vault registrations globally. Momentum is building in clinical as well. This is one of the areas of greatest need for our customers to modernize. For instance, in CTMS, which is the heart of clinical operations technology, we had an outstanding quarter. We now have more than 70 Vault CTMS customers in just three years since we released the product. In the second quarter, we had our first go live with a top 20, added another top 20 and signed our first top seven CRO. We also had CTMS pilot started two additional top 20 pharma. We're also making good progress on the clinical data side. More than 100 studies have now started on Vault CDMS. Customers appreciate the innovation and agility that Veeva CDMS brings, as well as the benefit of the integration with Vault eTMF and Vault CTMS. In the quarter, we had a win with a second top 20 pharma, who will run a handful of complex oncology trials on CDMS. If successful, this could lead to a broader deployment. I'm really excited about clinical. Our leadership position in clinical operations continues to expand. We're making great progress in clinical data, and there's a lot of interest in MyVeeva for clinical trials. Clinical is a large area and it's all coming together nicely. Finally, I'd like to share an update on our efforts outside of life sciences. The industries we serve continue to be impacted by the pandemic. But I'm encouraged by the success we're having with existing customers who continue to expand their use of Veeva. For instance, the top CPG company will replace an established incumbent with our quality applications across all their business units. Additionally, we continue to make progress with new customers. The top 20 agrichemicals business has selected regulatory solutions as their enterprise standard. Overall, the team had a strong quarter and is executing well. Before closing, I want to give special thanks to Tim. This is his last earnings call with us, and I'm grateful for his many years of partnership. Tim is staying with Veeva on a part-time basis going forward as an advisor and mentor to the Veeva team. Finally, I'd like to acknowledge all of the Veeva employees for their innovation and creativity to come up with new and better ways to continue to support customers. And I'd like to thank our customers for their tireless efforts to fight this pandemic and to improve the lives of patients around the globe. I'm looking forward to deepening Veeva's partnership with our customers for many years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Tim. Yes. Brad, I'll take that one. Yes, these are complex areas, clinical. I do feel that, we're incrementally growing the business, yes. The product is getting more mature. We're getting some more reference customers. It's early. Still in CDMS, it's early. It's a big broad area, but I feel like we're on the right track. The core of CDMS, the electronic data capture part is starting to become pretty mature in its product, but there's a lot of new things in clinical, too, like MyVeeva for clinical trials. So we're doing well. I'm really happy with it. Outside life sciences, I would say, our two strongest verticals, CPG and cosmetics. We do have some chemicals, including some agrochemicals. We have a handful of agrochemical customers now. So \u2013 but I would \u2013 nothing has changed there. I would say, CPG and cosmetics is still our main focus. Thank you. It's a great question. I think there's a number of factors. I couldn't point to exactly one, but it's a combination of \u2013 we've now filled out the suite. We have QualityDocs for the SOP management. We have the Quality Management System for the CAPAs deviations, those types of things and we also have training, all in one unified platform. Nobody had that before. So it was a little bit hard for customers to understand at first. Now people are early \u2013 seeing early adopters do it. That's creating a lot of interest. I think, actually, COVID provides us a little bit of boost, because it's okay, everybody in the life sciences, there's more need to access things remotely and we perform. That's one thing about Vault. It performs exceedingly fast promote. We measure the performance from the end users browser time, and that's all around the world. The average time to view a document is less than 1.5 seconds. That's unheard of, of their existing systems. So these things are providing momentum. But one thing to know, quality is maybe our most conservative customer segment, very conservative. So the fact that we're moving fast in this conservative segment is really outstanding. Yes. Tom, I think, high level, important to know life sciences as a long \u2013 their long view on these things could take 10 years to bring the drug to market, product has a 20-year life cycle. So they have a long-term view to start with, and that hasn't changed. There \u2013 we don't see project delays or anything like that. We do see customers sometimes shift priorities a little bit. They may have COVID-related emergencies, which might relate to Veeva or non-Veeva. And when they relate to Veeva, that caused a little burst of business for us. When it relates to non-Veeva, that might delay one of our existing projects. So \u2013 but all in all, it's good. They're looking for efficiency and digital. So I think it's very \u2013 it's a very good thing for us and it feels nice and steady. It feels to me like life sciences has totally found their way and is comfortable with COVID. They know they have to contribute majorly for society and it's causing this burst of innovation and they can see their way through it. Yes. We're very excited about it, and you're right. It's new for Veeva, right? These are the applications for consumers, patients in clinical trials and doctors. In terms of the model, we won't be charging the doctors or the patients directly for that, right? That's \u2013 we'll monetize that through providing benefit for life sciences. And then as far as the details of exactly how and when and size of that, it's just a little bit too early to go into that, where we're really forming the product with our early adopters. And that's what we'll focus on customer success first. There's a tremendous amount of value there and we'll be able to monetize that in a reasonable way as we go forward. Thanks, Tom. Yes. The longitudinal patient data, I'll take that one. This is Peter. These were not takeaways. These were \u2013 I guess, they're competitive, that's for sure. They \u2013 these were people that were looking to analyze patient data to answer some questions that they hadn't been able to answer before. So they're specific to a brand. So they would have looked at other data sets and decided to go with ours, partly because they have strong partnerships with Veeva and they're looking for innovation. They're unsatisfied with the data sets that they get today. Well, maybe that's too strong, maybe not unsatisfied. They feel like there's something better out there. So they're going along on this journey with us. But the main thing to know about the early adopters, the main thing is not the sale. It's the partnership and the working together to help improve and shape the early product. That's what I'm really excited about. We're getting feedback. It's just invaluable from these early adopters. Yes. We're pretty bullish on that. So we have some uptick in business in the virtual events. And I think that's something we're looking forward to partnering with our customers as they go forward, because they're \u2013 yes, everybody is realizing that, a, pandemic is here a little longer than we initially expected and the power of digital is really being impressed on people. So we're pretty excited about our plans there. Thank you. Well, my planning horizon or the things I get excited about are usually a little longer-term, right? So 2025 is my focus. And I would say, that's what I'm excited about. I feel like, commercial, we're going to add a ton of value to our customers as we go towards 2025, and it's a combination of things. One is, I feel like we have potential to really do impactful things here in digital, not only with Engage, but with MyVeeva and with virtual events. So that is pure technology-based value that is added to the customers on the commercial side. And then the data, Data Cloud, that's a very large market, very strategic. And I can see the innovation we're bringing and the feedback from the early customers. So that's also important. And then the partnership, how the partnership in basically the pandemic in this time of stress is causing Veeva and our customers to get closer together. And I would say just the last thing, the hiring, not only the experienced hiring, but the awesome new graduates that we're bringing into the company and teaching them the right way and our policies and procedures around that. So, sometimes you work really hard and things come together and the timing is right, and maybe there's some sprinkling of good luck. But I'm just optimistic about our future. Hey, Sterling, it's Peter. I'll take that one. I don't have exact numbers for you. A very small portion of our work is specific to COVID-19. Now, it's important and it's strategic. And so we've done clinical trial work, where the team has had to really hustle and work that we can and our technologies really help. But in terms of business or financial, it's a very small portion. COVID-19 overall is very important. But if you look at life sciences overall, it's a small portion of life sciences revenue. Yes, Paul, why don't you take that one? Yes. It's working well. It's working well. There are pros and cons. First, I do recognize we have good relationships with our customers and those are developed largely in the face-to-face day. So to some extent, we're utilizing that. We wouldn't \u2013 maybe are we \u2013 is it more difficult to develop new relationships in the virtual world? I think it is a bit. Now, having said that, we're on the same footing with everyone else. So I think they're getting used to that and we're executing very well on our events. But we're looking forward to seeing our customers in person again. Stan, it's Peter. Metadata is a strong competitor. They are the leader by market share in the space. We have not seen honestly a lot of change as it results to the acquisition to really focus on our own area. And that's this innovation that's bringing the whole clinical suite together from clinic operations integrated tightly with clinical data management, things that we're doing with the clinical database and now MyVeeva for clinical trials. So I'm not seeing particular changes from Metadata, they're still a strong competitor. Sure. Stan, thanks for the question. So probably on the first one pull-forward, as it relates to billing, you're talking about in the few millions area, not more material than that. We went into the pandemic with probably a thought like most companies, Stan, that there would be some requests from our customers around cash flow and billings changes. There are \u2013 overall, we're not really seeing that very much. We didn't see it too much in back-half of Q1 and we didn't see it very much in Q2. Where we are seeing it is in some of the segments that I talked about, Stan, in the Q1 call some of the customer segments that we're seeing. But it's not as much as we would have expected, which I think is a testament to overall life sciences remains relatively healthy compared to other industries that other companies may be engaged with, Stan. Sure. Hi, Brian, this is Peter. I'll take that one. What we've learned is, our products fit is really working where we're focusing the quality and the regulatory area, and we've kind of honed our motion into these industries. In terms of go-to-market, that'll be gradual expansion as we go forward. Now remember, this cosmetics, CPG, it's a big market and our products in there are good. But this is a reasonable sized market. This is about as big as clinical data management markets inside life sciences. So we'll see steady increases, but nothing drastic. Yes. By geography, I think, we're pretty steady. We haven't seen things. Now we see difference in interactions, right? In Asia, things have largely gone back to normal in many ways, visiting customers in person, employees getting together, U.S. not too much, mostly Europe not. But in terms of financial performance or business activity, no change to the geographic mix. Yes. Okay, pile on there. Like Sandy, one of the thing to think about is this amazing contact manager, you go in there and you search, you're searching for a brand, a company or a person and you find it and then you find all the things that are connected to that. That's the way to think about it. Absolutely kind of revolutionary really. Thanks, Sandy. So CRO is very important for us, both, yes. They will use our software, but they're also a channel for, particularly for our clinical data management area, right? They would sometimes do clinical data management for customers small and large. Yes, we were a bit cautious on the CRO because of their business got hit by COVID, because they couldn't get out there, trials being stopped, that's a pretty immediate hit. In terms of this deal or more broadly CTMS in the CRO area, it's \u2013 they're doing it and this customer, in particular, doing it for increased efficiency. That's one. They have a lot of people. CTMS is the heartbeat of it. Their process and systems that they had before was not fast, it's not configurable, it's not user friendly, and they couldn't get the information out of it that they wanted to. So it's about efficiency. And the other part is they're realizing that Veeva is connecting things together into a clinical network, and our clinical data management system is quite promising. So there's a need for the CROs to be close to Veeva, unless they would like to, and some do, right? A couple try to develop their own technologies. But I think most are realizing that it's probably better to align with an industry standard technology, which Veeva is becoming. MyVeeva for patients, they can do some things electronically. But, for example, well over 80% of just what's called the electronic consent, meaning, the patient giving their consent to medical procedures right through data, et cetera. About over 80% of that is done by paper, signatures and faxes. So, it's a really fragmented and there's quite a few different applications for quite a few of these different things. So, it's not a great world. It's much easier to buy something on amazon.com than it is to go through a clinical trial as a patient. And that's really what \u2013 that's what it's about bringing it all together for the patient. Yes. We primarily see IQVIA on the commercial side. We don't see them so often in the R&D space. The \u2013 given what they're kind of going to market with, they've been \u2013 had a particular focus on, as you know, the data side within primarily focused on commercial and then also they announced some software applications in commercial. So, we tend to see them there most, but not so much in R&D. Thank you, operator, I'd like to take this time to say thank you again to Tim Cabral. When our Veeva venture started together, Tim was our part-time bookkeeper and Veeva was an infant. And now 13 years of partnership later, here we are, a company that's contributed in a major way to our customers, employees, investors and society in general. And throughout that, Tim has been steady and strong like a rock throughout the journey, and he has built an amazing team. So, Tim, you get my vote for CFO of the decade. Thank you, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. And I look forward to talking with you again at Investor Day online on October 29. Have a great evening. Goodbye."

            "name": "Paul Shawah",
            "content": "Hey, Sterling, this is... Yes. I want to take that one. All right. So this is Paul, Sterling. Thanks for the question. Yes, I mean, this is a really \u2013 it's a really significant one. It's a different approach to digital. What we're doing here I view this as a platform that's going to lead us and lead the industry and kind of that kind of next direction and next day innovation in digital space. If you think about the problem that it's solving and most doctors, they deal with multiple different pharma companies. And from those pharma companies, they probably are dealing with multiple different brands. Every pharma company would love to be in the pocket of every HCP, accessible via an app or accessible via website. But when you multiply that out, it's just \u2013 it's a \u2013 the law of large numbers takes any, you end up with the fact that it's too complex for the doctor. They can't be able to engage digitally with so many different companies, because they'd have to download so many apps. They have to go to so many different websites, remember so many different passwords. We're putting all of that into one place. We're making it really easy for the doctor to access the entire industry, all in one place on an app, or on a website. And we're building it around. We're doing digital differently from the standpoint that there's a human relationship involved. There's a human being, the rep or the medical science liaison or some person from the life sciences company who is creating a connection with the HCP. And what that means is, once they create a connection, they're able to do certain things. They're able to chat, they're able to share information, they're able to request samples. So as we talk about this with our \u2013 with some prospective early customers, we've had a ton of interest as \u2013 after we've announced this. They're real interested in use cases of secure communication. So how do they interact with customers in a secure way that is compliant. So things like a text message may not be so compliant. But doing it via MyVeeva would be, they're looking to do things like schedule more Engage Meetings with them. They're looking for ways to be accessible by that doctor to do things like requesting samples on their own terms. So really, the big problem that we're solving is, we're making it easy for the doctor to access life sciences when and how they want to and to enhance the relationship that they have with their reps. That's really the way to think about it. Yes. So this is an interesting one. When doctors think about their practice and the products that they use to for their patients, they don't necessarily think, hey, this is just pharma or just med device or they think about the full portfolio of products that, that could be applicable to their patients. Now, which could lead us down a path over time for us to enabling us as a solution for HEPs that are able to interact more broadly with life sciences companies, but consumer and med device. Having said that, that's certainly a long-term play and something that we would \u2013 a long-term vision that we would grow into. The focus for us today is purely on the life sciences companies. Remember, what we're doing here is, life sciences is our customer. We're enabling a lot of the capabilities and the processes that they have or that they need to improve. That's really our focus. But there is some potential longer-term and \u2013 but that's not what we're thinking about today. We're really thinking about the pure life sciences, traditional pharma, biotech customer that we serve. Yes. That's a good question. And that is precisely the magic, what you just described right there. In fact, it's one app on the device. That's why it's so powerful as one app and it's one website. And they can be invited by one company and create a connection and then they're on it. So one analogy, one thing that you might \u2013 you may think about from your everyday world is LinkedIn. Once you're on LinkedIn, you're on LinkedIn once, and you have one profile on there, and then you can start to connect with people. MyVeeva will have much of that same kind of model, where a doctor will get invited, they'll create and set up an account one-time, and then they'll be able to connect with anybody across all of life sciences through a single application. So that's precisely why it's different and why it's so unique in the industry, because nothing else really exists like that. And then that relationship \u2013 the reason why one of the things that we see pretty consistently is that, digital kind of pure digital standalone without a relationship versus digital combined with a relationship, the combination with the relationship, it's an order of magnitude more effective. So the perfect example for that is, when you look at the engagement rate with an e-mail sent by a human being, let's say, approved e-mail versus the engagement rate from a corporate home office, it's much, much higher with approved e-mail because of that relationship, and that's also another kind of key point with MyVeeva. It's combining digital with human relationships. So yes, really good, insightful question."

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Rick Lund, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nRick Lund: Good afternoon and welcome to Veeva\u2019s Fiscal 2021 first quarter earnings call for the quarter ended April 30, 2020. With me on today\u2019s call are Peter Gassner, our Chief Executive Officer; Paul Shawah, SVP of Commercial Cloud; and Tim Cabral, our Chief Financial Officer. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding trends, our strategies and the anticipated performance of the business. These forward-looking statements will be based on management\u2019s current views and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those related to the impacts of COVID-19 on our business, the life sciences industry and global economic conditions. Our actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the risks listed in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our most recent filing on Form 10-K, which is available on the Company\u2019s website at veeva.com under the Investors section and on the SEC\u2019s website at sec.gov. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today, May 28, 2020 based on the facts available to us today. If this call is replayed or viewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Veeva disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today\u2019s call but we\u2019ll not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. The guidance we will provide today is in part based on our assumptions as to the macroeconomic environment in which we will be operating in the future including the timing and pace of recovery from any negative effects caused by COVID-19. Such matters that are beyond our control and our assumptions may not be correct. On the call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today\u2019s earnings release, which is available on our website and as an exhibit to the Form 8-K filed with the SEC just before this call. One final note, concurrent with our earnings release, we have posted an investor presentation on our IR website that contains a summary of our Q1 and recent historical financial results and our updated guidance. We will continue to provide these materials on a quarterly basis going forward as a helpful reference for those interested in our business. With that, thank you for joining us and I will turn it over to Peter.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you, Rick, and thanks to everyone joining us today. Before I give an update on the business, I would like to extend our sympathies to all those who have been affected by the pandemic. I would also like to thank our customers who are supporting healthcare professionals and patients and working around the clock to produce diagnostics, equipments, vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. We had a strong first quarter with results coming in ahead of our guidance. Total revenue was $337 million up 38% year-over-year. Subscription revenue grew 36% year-over-year and our non-GAAP operating margin was 39%. We are slightly decreasing the top end of our full-year total revenue guidance by $10 million to $1.395 billion and raising our full-year top end operating income guidance by $10 million to $510 million. This is due to changes related to COVID-19 in certain segments of the business, particularly in Physicians World and the Crossix areas, where in-person events have largely stopped and advertising is down. This also reflects lower costs related to travel. Tim will discuss our guidance in more detail in his section. This crisis has caused significant disruption but it has also promoted innovation throughout the industry and at Veeva which over time will be beneficial for Life Sciences, and for Veeva. I\u2019m more confident than ever in our long-term opportunity and our ability to achieve our $3 billion revenue target in 2025. The effects of the pandemic have been far reaching and the world is looking to life sciences companies for solutions. The industry is less affected financially than many others and remains relatively strong overall. But it is certainly a time of significant change as many of the industry processes become more virtual. Healthcare providers and patients are delaying many non-essential visits and elective procedures. When comparing February to April in the U.S. using Crossix data, doctor visits were down by more than 50%. This is impacting some life sciences companies more than others depending on their product portfolio. Many clinical trials have been delayed to avoid non-essential patient visits to doctors, in-person visits by sales reps or clinical research associates, the doctors have also largely stopped. These changes are causing patients, doctors and the industry to rapidly adopt digital strategies. Necessity is creating innovation. Using Crossix data, we see that telemedicine increased rapidly in the U.S. from less than 1% of doctor visits in February to more than 30% of visits in April. Doctors and patients are getting used to a mix of in-person and digital interactions and are finding it productive. Using Veeva Pulse data from Veeva CRM, we see that in the U.S., remote meetings between pharma and doctors with Veeva Engage are up more than 30 times and approved e-mail communications are up more than two times from February to April. Doctors are telling us they find digital meetings effective and they look forward to a mix of in-person and digital interactions once things get back to normal. It's good to see the healthcare systems and the life sciences industry evolving so rapidly. It was a very busy quarter for Veeva, we executed our first ever entirely remote product releases in both CRM and Vault. We made major changes to our product plans to release new digital capabilities, customers need most right now. And our team in the field did an outstanding job of supporting customers around the globe, ensuring the existing programs stayed on track, getting them live quickly with new digital capabilities and helping with many COVID-19 related special projects. We also quickly and effectively turned all our customers summit through the end of the year into virtual events. Q1 has been our greatest quarter of innovation so far with innovations coming in all areas of the company from product to sales, services and marketing right through to HR and finance. I'm so proud of the Veeva team, and I'm personally thankful to be working around so many bright people executing together as a team. I'd like to touch on two big new areas of innovation, Data Cloud and MyVeeva. We had a major announcement for commercial in March with Veeva Data Cloud planned for the U.S. by year-end. Veeva Data Cloud will bring a better solution for patient data to the industry. This is a large, underserved area and ripe for disruption. Like the other markets we've entered, we aim to bring much needed innovation. Veeva Data Cloud is powered by the Crossix data platform, which gives us a distinct advantage. It's a world-class technology platform built for the development and delivery of large scale patient data and analytics, all in a privacy safe way. Customer feedback on Data Cloud has been very positive. And we've already signed our first two early adopters for pilots, one emerging biotech and one top 20 pharma. Over time, we will expand Data Cloud to more data offerings and countries. The Crossix data platform could be as important an asset to Veeva as the Vault platform. But just as we saw with Vault, it will take us many years to become the market leader. We\u2019re starting in a focused way around patient data for the U.S. market. We\u2019ll concentrate on early adopter success and product excellence and grow from there. Just two weeks ago at our R&D Customer Summit, we announced MyVeeva for clinical trials. This is our first patient facing application. It will help patients through the clinical trial process for managing medications and appointments to participating and remote doctor visits. MyVeeva will enable clinical research sites around the world to eliminate paper and deliver a better patient experience. The product is planned for release in Q4 and will be free for clinical research sites. MyVeeva has the potential to remove most of the paper from the clinical trial process and transform the patient site and sponsor experience. We\u2019re very excited about MyVeeva. We also reacted quickly in the quarter to add remote sample request management to Veeva Engage and remote source monitoring to Veeva Site Vault, our solution for clinical research sites. We\u2019re already seeing significant use of these new digital capabilities. Overall, we're changing our product roadmap to add more digital capabilities and products and we're helping customers define and operationalize their new digital strategy. It's an exciting time to be in the industry and at Veeva. In uncertain times, people look to join high quality companies and companies look to partner with other high quality companies. We\u2019re seeing both trends play out for Veeva. We have been able to attract great new talent and see an increase in qualified inbound candidates and faster interview cycles. Our customer relationships have always been strong, but now they're getting even stronger. We're deepening our partnerships and seeing greater collaboration around long-term roadmap. Customers appreciate how well Veeva has executed and gone the extra mile in this time of change. Now, I'd like to share a few additional highlights for the quarter by area. It was a very active quarter for Commercial Cloud. Veeva CRM continued to gain market share as we added 10 new SMB logos in the quarter and saw further expansions at enterprise customers. OpenData also had a record number of wins in the quarter. Adoption of Approved Email and Engage Meeting was very strong. And Commercial Cloud expanded in important ways in digital and with Data Cloud as I mentioned earlier, and also with Crossix Veeva to better connect sales and marketing. We\u2019re bringing Veeva CRM field activity data into the Crossix Veeva marketing analytics solutions to give brand marketers insights into how sales and marketing activities are working together. For example, brands can see the impact of media campaigns on doctors recently called on by the field. We have a bold vision for Commercial Cloud. The acquisition of Crossix and the announcement of Data Cloud is a big start. Commercial Cloud is about connecting customer facing teams, leveraging data and digital and solving for the specific needs of each major country and region. This is the type of strategic partners the industry needs in commercial. Our approach is resonating and giving us the opportunity to engage in even broader strategic planning with our customers. Turning to Vault, we just held our very first virtual summit two weeks ago. It was our R&D event for Europe and the feedback was very positive. We more than tripled attendance from last year and we\u2019re pleased to see the online event was really effective in advancing customer success and for restaurant selling. And looking at Vault development cloud progress, customers continue to adopt more Vault application. Vault QualitySuite is a good example and had a very strong quarter highlighted by another top 20 pharma selecting QualityDocs as their enterprise standard. This marks the 11th Top 20 to select QualityDocs. Clinical is another area where customers are standardizing on more Vault applications over time. This quarter and existing Top 20 pharma customer for CDMS, eTMF, and Study Startup will round out the full Vault clinical suite by adopting CTMS. Additionally, another European Top 20 decided to adopt eTMF and Study Startup as its enterprise standard after standardizing on RIM in Q4. We also announced that five of the seven top CROs have joined the Vault CDMS Partner Program. This is a very significant announcement and shows the increasing momentum of our CDMS product. Sponsors and CROs are like see that Vault CDMS has the potential to transform clinical data management. Now to our work outside Life Sciences and cosmetics and consumer goods, these industries have experienced major impacts from COVID-19. Cosmetic companies have seen a significant drop in demand, while CPG companies selling essential products have benefited from consumer stockpiling and have seen higher demand for certain products. Our team continues to execute Well, this quarter and new top 10 CPG companies selected QualityOne for an initial deployment. Since the onset of the pandemic, this customer has experienced a rapid spike in demand. To secure their supply chain, they needed to quickly establish and attract testing and auditing information for their suppliers. Our team was able to deliver a supplier quality management system within three weeks. So outside of Life Sciences business is experiencing some disruption due to COVID-19, I'm very proud of how they've continued to build Veeva\u2019s reputation for customer success, and as a trusted partner within these new industries. I'm also happy to announce that we've completed our search for our new CFO. He will start at Veeva in early June, we'll issue a formal announcement and share further details at that time. Tim is staying on to ensure a smooth transition and will remain an advisor to the company after the transition is complete. These have been tough times for everyone, but it's been inspiring to see what the industry and the Veeva teams have accomplished in such a short amount of time. I've never been more confident in Veeva\u2019s future. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Tim.\nTim Cabral: Thanks, Peter. Before I begin, I want to refer you to the investor presentation available on our IR website for a summary of our Q1 financial results and our updated guidance. Given the details included in that presentation, my comments on our Q1 results will be brief. I'm very pleased with our Q1 performance. While the financial results were strong, I was most impressed with our team's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our office space staff quickly pivoted to working from home, and our teams in the field showed tremendous execution on both the services and sales side during the quarter, and everyone went the extra mile to support our customers. I'll first share some color on how those efforts impacted our Q1 results. Then I'll talk in more detail about our outlook for the rest of the year. We entered the first quarter with significant momentum. Subscription revenue benefited from strong bookings in both Commercial Cloud and Vault.  Services had a record quarter primarily driven by Vault demand with good contribution from Veeva CRM Engage meeting projects. This was partially offset by cancellations related to in-person speaker events, which impacted our recently acquired Physicians World business. Operating margin outperformance in Q1 was mainly due to revenue exceeding our expectations. While we saw cost savings in the quarter, primarily from less travel, those were mostly offset by fees related to the cancellation of our in-person customer and employee events this year. Calculated billings for the quarter slightly exceeded our guidance. However, in the quarter, a large customer change from an annual to quarterly billing cycle which decreased Q1 calculated billings by roughly $10 million. Please note, this change does not affect our full-year billings, and is not related to COVID-19 as the change was made well before shelter-in-place orders were widespread. We also had a strong cash flow quarter with cash from operations coming in at $282 million, which included $20 million in excess tax benefit related to equity compensation. Q1 typically represents over 50% of cash from operations, and this Q1 was no exception. Our expectation for full-year cash flow from operations excluding the excess tax benefit has been revised down slightly to about $450 million due to the lower expected billings for the year, which I will comment on later. Before I go on the guidance, I would like to address the impact of COVID-19 on our business, and our observations on the impact to the industry we serve. The Life Sciences industry has not been as negatively impacted as some other industries. Many of our customers have indicated that they expect the recovery to begin in the second half of the year, and in most cases are not changing their appetite for continued investment. Our approach to guidance is informed by this outlook. While the life sciences industry remains relatively healthy, our customers have needed to make certain adjustments. For example, our Commercial Cloud customers are pushing out their advertising spend and canceling in-person speaker events, which has negatively impacted our Crossix and Physicians World businesses respectively. Meanwhile, we\u2019re seeing customers shift their focus to enable field reps to maintain virtual contacts with doctors, which has benefited Commercial Cloud. And as Peter also mentioned, certain segments of our target markets have been more impacted than others by COVID-19. Specifically, pre-commercial SMBs, contract research organizations, med device and cosmetics companies. Combined, these represent a small portion of our recurring revenue base, but that exposure to these segments will have a modest impact on our Vault business this year. Based on this new market environment, we've reduced our top line guidance to account for those impacted customer segments and changing industry dynamics. We have also widened our range to account for the increased uncertainty. For the full-year, we expect total revenue to be $1.380 billion to $1.395 billion. This brings the top end of guidance down by $10 million from a quarter-ago. We now expect Crossix and Physicians World to contribute $90 million to $95 million for the year, which is down $15 million from our previous guide. Subscription revenue was expected to be roughly $1.135 billion for the full-year, Commercial Cloud will contribute about $580 million in subscription revenue. This includes $76 million to $78 million from Crossix. Within Commercial Cloud, headwinds in the Crossix business are partially offset by strength in CRM add-ons. Please note, we do not expect any material benefit from adoption of Veeva CRM Engage meeting in fiscal 2021. We\u2019re currently providing this product to our customers free of charge to address the COVID-19 crisis. And we need to be flexible in the timing of when we start charging customers for the continued use of this product. Vault subscription revenue is now expected to be roughly $555 million with the reduction of $5 million driven by the customer segments, I mentioned earlier. Professional Services is anticipated to be $245 million to $260 million. This includes an expected $8 million to $9 million reduction in the Physicians World business, which is partially offset by strength in Vault and Commercial Cloud project demand. For the full-year, we anticipate non-GAAP operating income to be between $500 million and $510 million, and non-GAAP operating margin of over 36%. We expect to realize cost savings around travel and our move to virtual customer events through the end of the year, while still maintaining our aggressive hiring plan. We\u2019re now targeting a full-year EPS of $2.50 to $2.55 on a fully diluted share count of approximately $161 million. Calculated billings for the year are expected to be $1.465 billion to $1.480 billion. This includes reductions to the Crossix and Physicians World businesses impacted customer segments as mentioned earlier and potential COVID-19 related billing term changes. Q2 calculated billings is projected to be about $280 million with Q4 billings expected to make up more than 40% of this year's total. In Q2, we expect total revenue of $339 million to $341 million and professional services of $63 million to $64 million. Please note that sequential total revenue growth in Q2 will be muted relative to previous years. This is due to an expected greater impact of COVID-19 in Q2. Crossix seasonality and Q1 revenue benefited from an extra day of revenue recognition in the quarter. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be $126 million to $128 million and we expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.63 to $0.64 based on a fully diluted share count of approximately $161 million. In summary, we\u2019re fortunate to serve the life sciences industry. Their work to address the pandemic is inspiring and shines a spotlight on the industry's importance. I\u2019m proud Veeva has been able to quickly step-up to help our customers and the team continues to find ways to move the industry forward. Thank you for joining the call today. And I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nBrent Bracelin: Great. One for Peter and a quick follow-up for Tim. Peter, thanks for the industry stats here. 50% reduction in doctor visits, the patient visits relative to telemedicine now 30% increase. My question really is around what are you changing to the product roadmap as you think about this, this new world where there's less physical visits, more digital kind of doctor telemedicine visits, what are the type of things that you need to add to the platforms to kind of make it more digitally friendly?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, Brent, thanks for the question. So in terms of the telemedicine and doctor visits yes from February to April 50% reduction in doctor visits, and that's something we see from the Crossix data in near real time, one or two days lag. So that's a tremendous asset that we have in Crossix. So I just wanted to take a moment there to recognize yes, that's a tremendous asset. We're going to leverage that in many ways. Now the other one, the 30%, what that was is of the doctor visits in April, 30% of them were done by telemedicine. So that was up from less than 1% in February. So clearly what it means is patients and doctors are interacting with each other over the Internet. Life Sciences sees that and they have to adapt to that. So what we're doing is more investment in Veeva Engage and other digital things in the commercial area to enable more virtual interactions between healthcare providers and doctors, rather than all of that happened to be in the office. And then we announced MyVeeva for clinical trials. And that's a software that will allow clinical research sites to interact more remotely with their patients when they need to, so they can have a mix of in-office and virtual visits. And then the last thing was adding the remote site monitoring to the -- our Site Vault product to allow the clinical research associates from pharma to view the patient records remotely, instead of having to go there and view them on the paper. So those are some things we're doing in general what it means is we will enable pharma to be more virtual and more digital on the R&D side, in clinical particularly, and then in the commercial side, so that they can have a mix of in-person and digital. Overall that will make the industry -- overall that will make the industry more efficient. And that's why I'm excited about it. They'll make the industry more efficient, and it'll bring more information to doctors, and it'll make it more convenient for patients. So it's a really a good thing overall, even though it's rough, the COVID-19 definitely, that's very hard to go through. But the benefit of it is this increased move to digital which will help everybody in the healthcare ecosystem. \nBrent Bracelin: These are unique additional add-on features, this isn't going to be a wholesale change to come the platforms. Is that the right way to frame it?\nPeter Gassner: Well, I would say it's a major, I would say evolution of all our products and some of them are going to be new products as well. So yes I think evolution will bring our customers there for sure. But this will result in making existing products better and over time this will result in new products and it already has in MyVeeva.\nBrent Bracelin: Great, super helpful there and then just Tim as we think about the calculated billings guide here for Q2 of $280 million that does imply a little moderation set, what's factored in there, are you factoring in larger deal delays. Just trying to understand what you saw like in April, so far in May as it relates to what's baked into the assumptions for a slight moderation here in billings in the short run?\nTim Cabral: Yes, Brent, I would say a couple of things. And certainly we haven't seen any material change in demand in the early May time period, but as it relates to the guide, two things are contributing to that. Number one, over the last year, the underlying renewal base for Q2 has reduced relative to other quarters. So Q1 has gone up quite a bit and Q2 has gone down a little bit. So that impacts the overall calculated, we also see some assumption in there to what I talked about in my prepared remarks Brent, which is around the potential for customers requesting change in payment timing whether that's annual, the quarterly, whether that's primarily it\u2019s annual to quarterly that we're talking about there, Brent. So those two contributed to it. We do have, as I said a little bit of seasonality in the Crossix business, that is slightly impacting that as well.\nBrent Bracelin: Helpful color, we all have challenges with work from home. Mine's a little loud with the family here, but appreciate the color and the comments. Thank you.\nPeter Gassner: Thanks, Brent.\nTim Cabral: Thanks Brent.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne: Yes, thanks very much. Peter, I was just curious obviously, your client base is taking on a lot right now. And could you just talk to me about how they're thinking about managing all the new projects and studies they have going on in addition to going through a digital transformation, meaning no one would be concerned that they're dealing with so much from a science perspective, that dealing with that plus IT and evolving digital perspective might be too much for them to handle, frankly, dealing with that, because I think that serve one of the things that's really impressive about your results is that while they have budget, the question would be do they have the ability to sort of take on these digital transformation projects? At the same time, they're doing so many other things? Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: Yes, Kirk I think our customers doing a great job first of all, they're working really hard. So that's bottom line, I think they're working extra hard. They're working, they're rising to the challenge. So a lot of nights and weekends, so they're really going after it. But they also think in long cycles, that's the nature of the business. So they know that, if they want to have a drug approved six years from now, they have to get going now. So they think in long-term cycles. So they continue to do things. Now there are emergency projects that happened with COVID, they have a drug candidate, they have to pivot, they have to do this and that, they have to produce a new diagnostic, et cetera. So there are emergency projects. But that's not for especially for a larger pharmaceutical company. That's not the preponderance of what they're working on their population, maybe they're working on 10% of the people are working on emergency projects. The rest of the 90% are working on the long-term things that they need to do to be successful as a provider of medicine to society. And that's the long-term gain. Now those emergency projects, some of those will go in our favor and new clinical trial that uses our type of system or there's a company that's doing that\u2019s producing ventilators for the first time and it's a coalition of quite a few companies, they needed the distributed quality system and they needed it in three weeks. Okay, we're the only one that can do that. Right, so we benefited from that emergency project. Sometimes there'll be an emergency projects, they don't relate to what we're doing, business process change, et cetera and then maybe one of our long-term investment type projects will be delayed because of that. But that's, that's on the margin and probably for us, the puts and takes are about equal.\nKirk Materne: Okay, that's helpful color and maybe just one quick, real quick one from Tim. Tim is your customers from a commercial perspective, start thinking about selling more virtually. You'll have at Veeva in that respect. Do you think that you all can do more in terms of virtual selling not only in the near-term, but maybe in the long-term. And do you have any thoughts I guess on how that might impact sort of your efficiency from a cost of customer acquisition perspective, or maybe not even a CAC perspective, but just from a sales and marketing leverage perspective, just kind of curious if you're giving any thought. Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: I'll start with that one. And then we can have Tim as well. Yes, certainly Veeva is a company that's built on customer intimacy. Customer relationships are deep for us and we've had our in-person summits. And our account executives live in the region, they are visiting customers often. Of course, we can't do that now. But we've been a very virtual company in terms of using Zoom and other products. So we'll continue to do that. We had our customer first customer summit virtually, it was quite effective at spreading knowledge. So I think largely we'll be okay. We'll be okay with that. Everybody likes to see people in-person. I'm missing our employees and our customers. But also, we're also confident in the life sciences industry, they're going to have a treatment, they're going to have a vaccine for this. I believe it's a matter of time. And then and then we'll get back to a more normal mix of digital and in-person, which is where we were before COVID. Tim, in particular, as it relates to financing, I'll pass it over to you.\nTim Cabral: Sure, yes Kirk, I would echo what Peter said, I think given the depth of relationships that we have, not only with our customers, but this industry in general really enables us to address a remote work environment. I think, relatively more effectively than these are companies that don't have the depth and the intimacy of relationships that we have with the industry. So I would say Kirk over the last 10-ish weeks, we really haven't seen any impact to needing to work remotely in terms of our sales processes.\nKirk Materne: Okay, thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sandy Draper with SunTrust. Your line is open.\nSandy Draper: Thanks very much. I guess the first question is on the Data Cloud. Peter, you commented obviously, it's early but this could be a very significant long-term opportunity. In terms of the release, it sort of came at a time when there's probably a lot of distraction, but I'd love to hear I think you said you have one Top 20 pharma company and one smaller biotech or early stage company signed up but just what is the response been like, what are -- why do people want to take a look at it because the main competitor out there, a lot of that data has been intensely operationalized. And so it's very difficult decision, I would think to pull it out or switch. So to the extent that you can give some comments on what's getting customers to take a look at it. And admittedly, there may have been a lot of distraction, but what is the general commentary or feedback then from customers? Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: Thanks Sandy. We launched it in March. Now, that was something planned, right? That was something planned even before the acquisition closed with Crossix and we mobilized the new development team around Data Cloud, we did a lot of things. And we announced Data Cloud six months to the day after the acquisition was announced. Now that happened to be in the middle of March in the pandemic, when there were a lot of eyes on that on many other things. But we decided, hey, this is a long-term thing. We don't know when the pandemic stopping or starting and we need to go forward. This is a long-term thing. So we launched it was certainly noticed, but when you launch something big and new like this, for most people, hey the proofs in the pudding, you're going to do something. Let's see if you can do it. Now, the premise that we're on is that the industry needs choice A, which I believe is true. And they have not had choice, and B, that it needs innovation. So I view the existing data solutions, they really are not modern. They're the equivalent of client server software, when Veeva started, and yes, it's very difficult to uproot those entrenched players. In those days, it was difficult to uproot those deeply entrenched client server type of things, but you come with a better solution. You get early adopters and it starts to snowball. I feel that's what will happen here. It's the innovation that people are looking for, innovation in terms of timeliness and accuracy of patient data and completeness. The type of thing that I talked about with the telemedicine, how we knew in two days and we could track it daily. That's what life sciences would like to track about the interactions of their medicines with patients and doctors all in a privacy and safe way, they can't do that today. In terms of I\u2019ll give a little color on the two early adopters. One of them is a group of brand in a large Top 20 pharmaceutical company, they happen to be focusing on a relatively rare blood disorder. And that product is already in the market. And they're mapping patient journeys, not replacing anything. They're mapping patient journeys, which they couldn't do before with their data sources. And they're doing a double check on whether they're targeting the right physicians. Now, the other company is a platform company, it's a precision medicine platform company going what that means is they're engineering different types of DNA and RNA, they are a platform company with many candidates, don't have any candidates on the market yet, but they have some candidates close. So what they're doing for is patient journeys and physician targeting and overall patient population, they're trying to find out how many patients really can they target and how many doctors are really seeing those products on the market yet. So those are examples of things that are going on with Data Cloud would just focus really, really successful and innovate and I believe our business will grow from there.\nSandy Draper: Great, excuse that's really helpful commentary, I guess now follow-up on the CRO announcement or the discussion about the five of seven CROs who are on signing up for a partnership program. One I want to make sure I understand are these customers it doesn't sound like they're becoming enterprise customers, but maybe they're just willing to be more committed or looking more aggressively at the Veeva CDMS system. And then when you think, when I think about, since I cover the CROs, there are obviously under some near-term pressure, but they're all expecting a rebound, there's going to be, I think, a real sense of urgency for speed, innovation, getting trials restarted. Do you think there are things about your platform that will in the new environment as people are looking for more, more speed, more flexibility? Do you think you guys have the differentiation is going to be even greater as we start to see the trials come back? Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: Yes, so as it relates to CROs and our CDMS or EDC product, there's also a large a couple large. Yes, it's going to have a little dip now, clinical trials slow down and have a boom and they start up, right. So that's dynamics. And then with CROs especially the large ones and the small ones, they're very customer focused companies. They are service oriented companies that really want to give the best service for their customers and what's happened and what's true in this five out of the seven, they're large CROs that are now prepared to offer their clinical trial services on Veeva technologies and Veeva tools prepared to operate the Veeva technology for the companies that don't want to operate themselves, which would largely be smaller biotechs. What's happening there is these companies, sponsors, small sponsors are coming to them and say, hey, we were interested in your CRO services, we really want you to use Veeva Technology that gets the CROs to pay attention. Now, why are the sponsors asking for that? Simply, we can build studies faster than the competition now, sometimes four weeks instead of an average of 12. And we can build more flexible studies. For example, oncology studies have amendments, the existing state-of-the-art in the industry is that data has to be unloaded and loaded, or a new amendment. That doesn't happen in our system. So it's better technology. Now, change takes time. This is a risk avoidance area of license, nor do we, nor do we want all the customers at once. Our largest clinical trial in EDC, huge trial with the company, their biggest trial ever was set to start in March was delayed actually, but good news is it's actually going to have its fate planned to have its first patient in the first week of June here, so just a few days. So that's really what we're focused on is customer success in the CDMS market.\nSandy Draper: Thanks so much for the comments, Peter.\nPeter Gassner: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bryan Peterson with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nBryan Peterson: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. So first, I wanted to hit on how some of your customers may be utilizing some of the Commercial Cloud technology. There have been some stats out there on the Engage meeting usage. And I think it's seen rapid adoption. Is there anything that you can share on how that's trended? And I was also curious, as they're thinking about more of a digital motion, are there any potential headwinds from headcount cuts that could impact your business? Any thoughts there?\nPaul Shawah: Hey, Bryan, thanks. This is Paul. I'll take that one. And yes you're right. I mean, but first, I want to just kind of take a step back on the Engage side and just Veeva super proud and I'm super pleased with the Veeva team for coming together and being able to help the industry, if you think about what's happening out there is the sales channel has fundamentally shut down is largely shut down pretty much across the globe. It's starting to open up a little bit in different markets and countries and segments. And we've been able to help the industry turn that channel back on and we've been able to help them do that through things like, so feels really good to be able to the industry up lead the industry really getting into digital a whole lot faster which is just testament to the product team is so really pleased about that movement has happened and you're right really significant kind of adoption. One way that we think about the adoption is just utilization. And that's really the most important, it's the most important metric because doesn't matter so much how many people have and we're seeing that utilization, if you look at February compared with April. So we're really pleased with that shift and the industry is really starting to understand and appreciating and each week, we're continuing to see more and more adoption and more and more utilization of the product. And that's what we're focused on right now is just continuing that adoption and helping our customers be able to get the most out of using Engage.\nBryan Peterson: That's good to hear. And maybe one for Peter. We've kind of gone through an earnings season here, and we've heard different messages from different software companies. I'm just curious. You came out on the call that you're very confident that that $3 billion target. I'm curious, how do you think about hiring in the pace of investments over that long-term framework? Has there been any change near-term or just curious how you think about the pace of investments? Thanks, guys.\nPeter Gassner: Yes, let's see at high level, yes I\u2019m quite more confident than ever in the $3 billion and that's because part of it is just passage of time, we're getting closer to 2025 and no bad things happen. Part of it is that but a part of it is we spend a lot of time building a great team here, a great, a great culture and innovation engine. And now you see this tremendous stress point of three months. And that's when good companies and good management teams that are prepared step-up. So that's what I felt and seen at Veeva, this innovation that will lead to better customer relationships, better innovation. So that's why I'm feeling quite confident in the future. And Gosh, I didn't write it down Bryan. So feel confident in 2025 in the future, but you had a specific question there and I didn't write it down excuse me.\nBryan Peterson: No, I guess I was sort of referencing how you're thinking about hiring right. So with hiring freezes, and obviously people are thinking differently short-term, long-term. So curious to get your thoughts on that?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, hiring. So my main message is if any of you have people out there that would like to work at Veeva specially extra to the software engineering et cetera. We are hiring. Yes, we\u2019re definitely hiring because of the innovation that's going on. So we're hiring, we're finding a good hiring environment too, we\u2019re getting good quality candidates. And the interview process is a little faster. So we think it's a great time to load up on great talent. In times of stress like this, there's a flight to quality. And companies want to do business with quality companies that they can count on.  And people want to work for quality companies that they can count on. So I think it's going to be a real boost for our hiring.\nBryan Peterson: Great, thanks, Peter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nRishi Jaluria: Hey guys, thank you for taking my questions. Glad everyone's staying safe and Tim certainly going to miss working with you looking forward to working with your successor. Hopefully they can live up to the high standards you\u2019ve set. I wanted to start by asking Peter, in the prepared remarks, you talked about some of the headwinds that some customers are facing from non-essential visits and elective procedures, and then even some delays in certain trials, wanted to get a sense for what are you seeing in Asia? And the reason I asked that is because they're ahead of us on the curve in terms of reopenings right. I mean, elective procedures and elective visits are allowed in Japan and a little bit more close to business as usual than we're seeing here. So if we think of that as kind of an indication of the future, I wanted to get a sense for what does that, what are you seeing from your customers out there? And maybe what sort of conclusions can we draw for the rest of your business here in the future, and I've got a follow-up.\nPeter Gassner: I think as it relates to little different by region, China being different than Japan and Korea for example, but in general, it's a vigilant, it's a return to gradually to a guarded way of going about your normal business, certainly much more, not too big, large group events, clean your hands temptation, et cetera because everybody knows there's no vaccine yet. There's no highly effective treatment. So you have to be careful. So they're getting about their business, but they're being more careful, I would expect that in the U.S. and other countries that where we're going to slowly return to that, a very careful return to visiting people staying away from large groups. And now then we would need that before we can fully get back to the larger group gatherings.\nRishi Jaluria: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. You\u2019re seeing some pretty impressive adoption of some of the virtual engagement products, right, Engage you're talking about 30 times on the remote meeting side approved e-mail up 2x in February to April. Philosophically, how are you thinking about how long lasting these changes are going to be in the life sciences industry? Is this something that's seeing a steep adoption because it's a necessity? And then hopefully the near medium term post-vaccine, things go kind of back to normal? Or is this a long lasting irreversible change? And more of these customers are going to be adapting remote engagement solutions on a greater basis no matter what happens? Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: Yes, that's a good one. I think what we're seeing is really an acceleration of what the industry was going to go through anyways, just over a longer period of time. So the industry was on track, was on pace to adopt digital and we saw that adoption. It was steadily increasing. And with COVID, with lockdown, the industry was now forced to accelerate that. And I think we saw, probably two or three years of digital transformation happening within just a couple of months. But what's been remarkable is I have never seen in my career, this shift over literally three months to turn on digital channels. So it's quite remarkable. And I will call out shamelessly that made that technology to allow our customers to be able to turn on, but also to our customers for putting the foundation in place to be ready and to be prepared. So the shift happened a whole lot faster. I do think obviously, we can't predict what happens with this pandemic, but I think it's going to make the industry more efficient. We're already seeing some of those benefits, the product is working are getting really deep engagement with customers. And just like with telehealth and telemedicine, we're seeing more patients do telemedicine and they actually like it. So they're going to do more of it. I think that same analogy is true here, where doctors are more comfortable engaging digitally, where farmers are more comfortable engaging digitally, and they'll do more of it over time, they're starting to see that really appreciate the benefits of moving to digital faster.\nRishi Jaluria: All right, great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you so much guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Wong with Guggenheim Securities, your line is open.\nKen Wong: Great, thanks for taking my question. Peter, you mentioned MyVeeva earlier and just wondering how this product could potentially help your CDMS push and then just kind of based on what it sounds like it's targeted very much towards the clinical trials but do you see a potential for this product to shift to more into more of the traditional doctor patient, kind of telehealth manner. I know that's not really a market you guys typically cater in. But it does seem like something that could be transferable. Any thoughts there?\nPeter Gassner: First MyVeeva, that's really about enabling the clinical research sites and the patients, thousands of them around the world and really just transforming the clinical research process for the whole industry. And when I say industry there, I mean, the patient's clinical research sites and sponsors, everybody involved. And there's a tremendous amount of excitement in that in Veeva. We're going to help bring medicines, to critical medicines to patients faster than they otherwise would. And that's, that's a really great feeling. And that will help our business in the life sciences area, in the clinical area. Yes, we're giving the products for free to clinical research sites. But that'll over time I believe have a great business to our clinical business overall within Life Sciences, CDMS, CTMS, our whole clinical operations suite. So that is one and then sorry, I didn't read that. Your second question was, do I see that going into more telehealth and that type of thing?\nKen Wong: Correct.\nPeter Gassner: Yes, MyVeeva is to enable a remote visit from a doctor to a patient in a clinical trial. But I don't see Veeva going into the telemedicine business broadly, which is that's something different. I think you'll see the people that provide the EMRs and other things for the normal caregiving. Yes, that's not for us at this time. We wouldn't be in that area. Some of the technology ideas are the same. But it's a really different market and you really have to focus and that's not an area we would focus on.\nKen Wong: Got it. Thanks for that color. And then a quick one for you, Tim, in terms of the billings reduction, any sense for in terms of the inorganic part, should we just assume similar to what you're seeing on the revenue side in terms of what's coming out. And then any quantification of what you guys are baking in for the change in billings term and how that could be, that could weigh down or how much that weigh down the billings?\nTim Cabral: Yes, Ken I do you think you're right. The revenue guidance is a good proxy for billings for those two businesses. So I think that's how I would think about it. We haven't talked about want to quantify yet the billings terms, there's so much uncertainty, they're trying to trying to really gauge exactly where that's going to land. What I would say is, as I said, there's a bit of a slight shift and a little bit more assumption around payment timing changes that will impact billing. All of the one we saw in Q1, where a customer now this wasn\u2019t COVID related of course, but a customer change from annual to quarterly billing. So we have some in there but not wanting to quantify it at this point.\nKen Wong: Great, thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stan Zlotsky with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nStan Zlotsky: Perfect. Thank you so much guys. Maybe if we can at a very high level help to characterize essentially, what you saw in your business as far as engagement with customers prospects on the sales side within March, April, and what you're seeing quarter-to-date in May. And I would presume that those interactions right consistently like the sales interactions varied quite drastically between your CPG customers versus your pharmaceutical customers? It's actually what everybody's looking for is kind of like the second derivative, right is the second derivative improving within like the CPG space, right is the Vault side of the business, has it seen did it see an uptick in sales activity in the March, April timeframe, that's continuing into May, and then have a quick follow-up.\nPeter Gassner: I'll pick that one, to sales and engagement inside of Life Sciences. I think it's been high. Our account executives has been gosh busier than ever helping customers, helping communicate giving them the information they need. I would say, myself and the executive team boy, we've been on Zooms more customers than we had before because it's just a time of an intense pressure cooker right of information. So these sales engagements, I do think they'll bear fruit. Over the long-term, we have long sales cycles, we develop relationships. In terms of the CPG that also happened in CPG. But I think CPG had more, relatively speaking to the percentage of what they had going on. They had more emergency projects, more supply chain things that they had to go on. So yes, conversations probably strengthened a bit, maybe not so much as they did in life sciences.\nStan Zlotsky: Got it. And then on, you're moving over to Vault and the drug trials, although everybody's listening and hearing all the drug trials, that kind of came to a sudden pause due to shut downs. But as far as the kind of like the economic impact to Veeva, if I recall like there's not necessarily usage components within Vault on the drug trials side. And if anything is the right to characterize your Vault may have benefited a little bit from all the additional, all additional drug trials that would need to start in order to support COVID development?\nTim Cabral: Yes, Stan this is Tim. So I would say you're right on the data operation side or clinical data operations side where we have a large penetration as we've talked about with eTMF and starting to get some good adoption on some of the other products we've introduced. It's not necessarily clinical trial driven, in terms of the demand there, it is more innovation driven, it is more driving to more effectiveness and efficiency to help start trials and help manage them over time. On the CDMS side, as you know in a clinical data management side, we're still in the very early innings of that journey, and focused on our early adopters. So this doesn't impact our revenue in a material way, except for I will say, well, not anything in the material way, Stan. As I talked about, there are certain segments where we're seeing a little bit of impact and not informed us on our slight reduction in the Vault guidance for the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Your line is open.\nBhavan Suri: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Appreciate that, glad you're all safe and well, I wanted to touch a little bit on the CRO announcement, I think was a question earlier, but you sort of answered that there's smaller biotech companies that may want to use Veeva until they tell the CRO, they want to work with Veeva. I guess when I look at the larger pharma companies that have bought some of the other pieces, eTMF, is there a network effect there, whether the integration across those pieces with CDMS or EDC, whatever want to call it right now. And that sort of plays out where they say, hey, if you're on a clinical trial, we want you to use this technology because it integrates better, it works better, we use it better. We have instances of that like pick a large pharma that's already done clinical case. We're doing trials with CDMS, is there a network effect did you see that at all, is that something that could play out? Or am I thinking about that incorrectly?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, Bhavan this is Peter. Yes, you're thinking about it correctly, we refer to that as the clinical suite. Customers are seeing that if they can have the sort of straight through processing and pre-built integrations from our clinical data management suite, to our clinical operations suite and have a full Veeva end-to-end experience in a clinical, there's material benefits and productivity for their people, for their operational people and their IT team. So and that's more pronounced in the larger companies, because they have more scale. And so then, then more integration and optimization gives them more benefits. So that's exactly the network effect. It's a network effect between clinical operations and between clinical data management and then if you get at a higher level, there's really a network effect between having on your whole development cloud on Veeva, the quality and manufacturing, the regulatory, the clinical operations, clinical data management. And now since we've introduced safety and have some customers live on safety, they see the potential of it, you get an integrated suite of things. And that's compelling. It's a compelling message and it's driving some of the demand.\nBhavan Suri: Got it, got it. And so maybe the standardization at some point, the CROs and then I just guess I want to touch competitively. Obviously, you have a couple competitors in the CDMS, EDC space. One of them specifically actually does have a product for data capture from patients, again, slightly different than yours, but love to understand if you've seen any competitive reaction from them, that's been acquired. But now it's been a while since we've acquired, you've had the top and Phase III clinical trial wins, you've had multiple wins in the EDC space or CDMS space, sorry. So love to understand what you\u2019re seeing in the competitive environment out there. Thank you.\nPeter Gassner: In terms of competitive environment haven't seen any particular change. I think all companies at this time are focused on taking care of their customers and their internal operations. So it's still the same. And I think our advantage on it is we have, it's back to the basics. We have 100% Cloud based, real time real cloud clinical data management system. There's two other large competitors in history that don't have that, every clinical data management customer Veeva is on exactly the same release. That's not the case with the other two. It's real cloud technology. And it's newer and more harder, more modern and then integrated with the whole suite. So those are our lasting advantages. And from now it's just customer success and focusing on that, so we really haven't seen any changes in the competitive environment. We have seen, I would say at our R&D Summit, two weeks ago, our first virtual summit, which was gosh triple the attendance from last year was a really great summit. There's a couple impactful presentations by customers, good sized customers in certainly in the top 50 companies, and they just were about the basics, we were able to build our studies in four weeks much faster than we could before. And we're very happy with the nimbleness and the way we can run an agile trial. So those customer success stories in those public forums, they can change their competitive dynamics in our favor over time.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSterling Auty: Yes, thanks. Hi guys, and Tim this is your final earnings call, this is certainly one way to go out with the pandemic. So congratulations on a great tenure. Just wondering if we could unpack the Vault performance in the quarter from this perspective, given some of the headwinds, you're seeing in clinical, wondering what the key drivers in demand, in terms of how much of this is coming from new customer versus expansion in existing customer as one look, and then separate from that, just what are the key drivers in terms of within maybe the R&D areas specifically? What are the use cases that you're seeing most prevalently you gave some examples, but I wonder if you just from a high level characterize it? Thank you.\nPaul Shawah: Hey Sterling, this is Paul. I\u2019ll comment on the key drivers from an industry perspective, and then I'll turn it over to Tim to talk a little bit about the performance. So, I think Tim alluded to this a little bit earlier with the idea that we're not so dependent on trial by trial. So as individual trials are being paused or delayed and generally we're not seeing cancellations, it's really just a shifting. That generally doesn't have an impact. So the projects that we're working on, these are projects and deals that have been budgeted and that have been kind of in the pipeline for some period of time. So that is kind of continued momentum. There is also a sense that in times like these, you need to be more efficient. So there is a little bit of a tailwind, just in terms of companies thinking about accelerating some of these projects where they're able to improve efficiency, improve productivity. So I think that's a bit of the tailwind that we're seeing as well. I'll turn it over to Tim to talk a little about the performance side.\nTim Cabral: Sure. Thanks, Paul. Sterling just you know the plan is for this to be my second to last earnings call. I intend to join you guys in August as well. So in terms of the performance in the last 10 weeks or so, we really haven't seen or looking at Q1, early Q2, we really haven't seen a material shift in the contribution of revenue from new versus upsell or cross sell opportunities. To Paul's point, I think the momentum of our pipeline coming into the quarter and throughout the quarter has been quite good on both fronts. So, there's no material change or change in shape from that perspective. While we\u2019re seeing modest impact on the clinical side for the comments we talked about, it's still very strong, and quality and regulatory continue to be strong as well. So, the three engines of growth are still the same as we've seen pre-pandemic, if that makes sense, Sterling.\nSterling Auty: It does and then one housekeeping follow-up, just to make sure that we're on the same page. How much revenue did that extra day in the quarter contribute, so we can think about the sequential is the right way?\nTim Cabral: Yes, about $3 million. So the Leap Year day, February 29 roughly our subscription run rate is about $3 million a day.\nSterling Auty: Perfect, thank you.\nOperator: So, I will turn the call back to the presenters for any closing remarks.\nPeter Gassner: So, thank you everyone for joining the call today. I'd like to thank our customers one more time for all the work they're doing to combat the pandemic. And I would like to thank the entire Veeva team for all your work supporting those customers. I'm really proud to work with you every day. Thanks very much.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tim Cabral",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Before I begin, I want to refer you to the investor presentation available on our IR website for a summary of our Q1 financial results and our updated guidance. Given the details included in that presentation, my comments on our Q1 results will be brief. I'm very pleased with our Q1 performance. While the financial results were strong, I was most impressed with our team's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our office space staff quickly pivoted to working from home, and our teams in the field showed tremendous execution on both the services and sales side during the quarter, and everyone went the extra mile to support our customers. I'll first share some color on how those efforts impacted our Q1 results. Then I'll talk in more detail about our outlook for the rest of the year. We entered the first quarter with significant momentum. Subscription revenue benefited from strong bookings in both Commercial Cloud and Vault.  Services had a record quarter primarily driven by Vault demand with good contribution from Veeva CRM Engage meeting projects. This was partially offset by cancellations related to in-person speaker events, which impacted our recently acquired Physicians World business. Operating margin outperformance in Q1 was mainly due to revenue exceeding our expectations. While we saw cost savings in the quarter, primarily from less travel, those were mostly offset by fees related to the cancellation of our in-person customer and employee events this year. Calculated billings for the quarter slightly exceeded our guidance. However, in the quarter, a large customer change from an annual to quarterly billing cycle which decreased Q1 calculated billings by roughly $10 million. Please note, this change does not affect our full-year billings, and is not related to COVID-19 as the change was made well before shelter-in-place orders were widespread. We also had a strong cash flow quarter with cash from operations coming in at $282 million, which included $20 million in excess tax benefit related to equity compensation. Q1 typically represents over 50% of cash from operations, and this Q1 was no exception. Our expectation for full-year cash flow from operations excluding the excess tax benefit has been revised down slightly to about $450 million due to the lower expected billings for the year, which I will comment on later. Before I go on the guidance, I would like to address the impact of COVID-19 on our business, and our observations on the impact to the industry we serve. The Life Sciences industry has not been as negatively impacted as some other industries. Many of our customers have indicated that they expect the recovery to begin in the second half of the year, and in most cases are not changing their appetite for continued investment. Our approach to guidance is informed by this outlook. While the life sciences industry remains relatively healthy, our customers have needed to make certain adjustments. For example, our Commercial Cloud customers are pushing out their advertising spend and canceling in-person speaker events, which has negatively impacted our Crossix and Physicians World businesses respectively. Meanwhile, we're seeing customers shift their focus to enable field reps to maintain virtual contacts with doctors, which has benefited Commercial Cloud. And as Peter also mentioned, certain segments of our target markets have been more impacted than others by COVID-19. Specifically, pre-commercial SMBs, contract research organizations, med device and cosmetics companies. Combined, these represent a small portion of our recurring revenue base, but that exposure to these segments will have a modest impact on our Vault business this year. Based on this new market environment, we've reduced our top line guidance to account for those impacted customer segments and changing industry dynamics. We have also widened our range to account for the increased uncertainty. For the full-year, we expect total revenue to be $1.380 billion to $1.395 billion. This brings the top end of guidance down by $10 million from a quarter-ago. We now expect Crossix and Physicians World to contribute $90 million to $95 million for the year, which is down $15 million from our previous guide. Subscription revenue was expected to be roughly $1.135 billion for the full-year, Commercial Cloud will contribute about $580 million in subscription revenue. This includes $76 million to $78 million from Crossix. Within Commercial Cloud, headwinds in the Crossix business are partially offset by strength in CRM add-ons. Please note, we do not expect any material benefit from adoption of Veeva CRM Engage meeting in fiscal 2021. We're currently providing this product to our customers free of charge to address the COVID-19 crisis. And we need to be flexible in the timing of when we start charging customers for the continued use of this product. Vault subscription revenue is now expected to be roughly $555 million with the reduction of $5 million driven by the customer segments, I mentioned earlier. Professional Services is anticipated to be $245 million to $260 million. This includes an expected $8 million to $9 million reduction in the Physicians World business, which is partially offset by strength in Vault and Commercial Cloud project demand. For the full-year, we anticipate non-GAAP operating income to be between $500 million and $510 million, and non-GAAP operating margin of over 36%. We expect to realize cost savings around travel and our move to virtual customer events through the end of the year, while still maintaining our aggressive hiring plan. We're now targeting a full-year EPS of $2.50 to $2.55 on a fully diluted share count of approximately $161 million. Calculated billings for the year are expected to be $1.465 billion to $1.480 billion. This includes reductions to the Crossix and Physicians World businesses impacted customer segments as mentioned earlier and potential COVID-19 related billing term changes. Q2 calculated billings is projected to be about $280 million with Q4 billings expected to make up more than 40% of this year's total. In Q2, we expect total revenue of $339 million to $341 million and professional services of $63 million to $64 million. Please note that sequential total revenue growth in Q2 will be muted relative to previous years. This is due to an expected greater impact of COVID-19 in Q2. Crossix seasonality and Q1 revenue benefited from an extra day of revenue recognition in the quarter. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be $126 million to $128 million and we expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.63 to $0.64 based on a fully diluted share count of approximately $161 million. In summary, we're fortunate to serve the life sciences industry. Their work to address the pandemic is inspiring and shines a spotlight on the industry's importance. I'm proud Veeva has been able to quickly step-up to help our customers and the team continues to find ways to move the industry forward. Thank you for joining the call today. And I will turn it back to the operator for your questions. Yes, Brent, I would say a couple of things. And certainly we haven't seen any material change in demand in the early May time period, but as it relates to the guide, two things are contributing to that. Number one, over the last year, the underlying renewal base for Q2 has reduced relative to other quarters. So Q1 has gone up quite a bit and Q2 has gone down a little bit. So that impacts the overall calculated, we also see some assumption in there to what I talked about in my prepared remarks Brent, which is around the potential for customers requesting change in payment timing whether that's annual, the quarterly, whether that's primarily it's annual to quarterly that we're talking about there, Brent. So those two contributed to it. We do have, as I said a little bit of seasonality in the Crossix business, that is slightly impacting that as well. Thanks Brent. Sure, yes Kirk, I would echo what Peter said, I think given the depth of relationships that we have, not only with our customers, but this industry in general really enables us to address a remote work environment. I think, relatively more effectively than these are companies that don't have the depth and the intimacy of relationships that we have with the industry. So I would say Kirk over the last 10-ish weeks, we really haven't seen any impact to needing to work remotely in terms of our sales processes. Yes, Ken I do you think you're right. The revenue guidance is a good proxy for billings for those two businesses. So I think that's how I would think about it. We haven't talked about want to quantify yet the billings terms, there's so much uncertainty, they're trying to trying to really gauge exactly where that's going to land. What I would say is, as I said, there's a bit of a slight shift and a little bit more assumption around payment timing changes that will impact billing. All of the one we saw in Q1, where a customer now this wasn't COVID related of course, but a customer change from annual to quarterly billing. So we have some in there but not wanting to quantify it at this point. Yes, Stan this is Tim. So I would say you're right on the data operation side or clinical data operations side where we have a large penetration as we've talked about with eTMF and starting to get some good adoption on some of the other products we've introduced. It's not necessarily clinical trial driven, in terms of the demand there, it is more innovation driven, it is more driving to more effectiveness and efficiency to help start trials and help manage them over time. On the CDMS side, as you know in a clinical data management side, we're still in the very early innings of that journey, and focused on our early adopters. So this doesn't impact our revenue in a material way, except for I will say, well, not anything in the material way, Stan. As I talked about, there are certain segments where we're seeing a little bit of impact and not informed us on our slight reduction in the Vault guidance for the year. Sure. Thanks, Paul. Sterling just you know the plan is for this to be my second to last earnings call. I intend to join you guys in August as well. So in terms of the performance in the last 10 weeks or so, we really haven't seen or looking at Q1, early Q2, we really haven't seen a material shift in the contribution of revenue from new versus upsell or cross sell opportunities. To Paul's point, I think the momentum of our pipeline coming into the quarter and throughout the quarter has been quite good on both fronts. So, there's no material change or change in shape from that perspective. While we're seeing modest impact on the clinical side for the comments we talked about, it's still very strong, and quality and regulatory continue to be strong as well. So, the three engines of growth are still the same as we've seen pre-pandemic, if that makes sense, Sterling. Yes, about $3 million. So the Leap Year day, February 29 roughly our subscription run rate is about $3 million a day."

            "name": "Peter Gassner",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick, and thanks to everyone joining us today. Before I give an update on the business, I would like to extend our sympathies to all those who have been affected by the pandemic. I would also like to thank our customers who are supporting healthcare professionals and patients and working around the clock to produce diagnostics, equipments, vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. We had a strong first quarter with results coming in ahead of our guidance. Total revenue was $337 million up 38% year-over-year. Subscription revenue grew 36% year-over-year and our non-GAAP operating margin was 39%. We are slightly decreasing the top end of our full-year total revenue guidance by $10 million to $1.395 billion and raising our full-year top end operating income guidance by $10 million to $510 million. This is due to changes related to COVID-19 in certain segments of the business, particularly in Physicians World and the Crossix areas, where in-person events have largely stopped and advertising is down. This also reflects lower costs related to travel. Tim will discuss our guidance in more detail in his section. This crisis has caused significant disruption but it has also promoted innovation throughout the industry and at Veeva which over time will be beneficial for Life Sciences, and for Veeva. I'm more confident than ever in our long-term opportunity and our ability to achieve our $3 billion revenue target in 2025. The effects of the pandemic have been far reaching and the world is looking to life sciences companies for solutions. The industry is less affected financially than many others and remains relatively strong overall. But it is certainly a time of significant change as many of the industry processes become more virtual. Healthcare providers and patients are delaying many non-essential visits and elective procedures. When comparing February to April in the U.S. using Crossix data, doctor visits were down by more than 50%. This is impacting some life sciences companies more than others depending on their product portfolio. Many clinical trials have been delayed to avoid non-essential patient visits to doctors, in-person visits by sales reps or clinical research associates, the doctors have also largely stopped. These changes are causing patients, doctors and the industry to rapidly adopt digital strategies. Necessity is creating innovation. Using Crossix data, we see that telemedicine increased rapidly in the U.S. from less than 1% of doctor visits in February to more than 30% of visits in April. Doctors and patients are getting used to a mix of in-person and digital interactions and are finding it productive. Using Veeva Pulse data from Veeva CRM, we see that in the U.S., remote meetings between pharma and doctors with Veeva Engage are up more than 30 times and approved e-mail communications are up more than two times from February to April. Doctors are telling us they find digital meetings effective and they look forward to a mix of in-person and digital interactions once things get back to normal. It's good to see the healthcare systems and the life sciences industry evolving so rapidly. It was a very busy quarter for Veeva, we executed our first ever entirely remote product releases in both CRM and Vault. We made major changes to our product plans to release new digital capabilities, customers need most right now. And our team in the field did an outstanding job of supporting customers around the globe, ensuring the existing programs stayed on track, getting them live quickly with new digital capabilities and helping with many COVID-19 related special projects. We also quickly and effectively turned all our customers summit through the end of the year into virtual events. Q1 has been our greatest quarter of innovation so far with innovations coming in all areas of the company from product to sales, services and marketing right through to HR and finance. I'm so proud of the Veeva team, and I'm personally thankful to be working around so many bright people executing together as a team. I'd like to touch on two big new areas of innovation, Data Cloud and MyVeeva. We had a major announcement for commercial in March with Veeva Data Cloud planned for the U.S. by year-end. Veeva Data Cloud will bring a better solution for patient data to the industry. This is a large, underserved area and ripe for disruption. Like the other markets we've entered, we aim to bring much needed innovation. Veeva Data Cloud is powered by the Crossix data platform, which gives us a distinct advantage. It's a world-class technology platform built for the development and delivery of large scale patient data and analytics, all in a privacy safe way. Customer feedback on Data Cloud has been very positive. And we've already signed our first two early adopters for pilots, one emerging biotech and one top 20 pharma. Over time, we will expand Data Cloud to more data offerings and countries. The Crossix data platform could be as important an asset to Veeva as the Vault platform. But just as we saw with Vault, it will take us many years to become the market leader. We're starting in a focused way around patient data for the U.S. market. We'll concentrate on early adopter success and product excellence and grow from there. Just two weeks ago at our R&D Customer Summit, we announced MyVeeva for clinical trials. This is our first patient facing application. It will help patients through the clinical trial process for managing medications and appointments to participating and remote doctor visits. MyVeeva will enable clinical research sites around the world to eliminate paper and deliver a better patient experience. The product is planned for release in Q4 and will be free for clinical research sites. MyVeeva has the potential to remove most of the paper from the clinical trial process and transform the patient site and sponsor experience. We're very excited about MyVeeva. We also reacted quickly in the quarter to add remote sample request management to Veeva Engage and remote source monitoring to Veeva Site Vault, our solution for clinical research sites. We're already seeing significant use of these new digital capabilities. Overall, we're changing our product roadmap to add more digital capabilities and products and we're helping customers define and operationalize their new digital strategy. It's an exciting time to be in the industry and at Veeva. In uncertain times, people look to join high quality companies and companies look to partner with other high quality companies. We're seeing both trends play out for Veeva. We have been able to attract great new talent and see an increase in qualified inbound candidates and faster interview cycles. Our customer relationships have always been strong, but now they're getting even stronger. We're deepening our partnerships and seeing greater collaboration around long-term roadmap. Customers appreciate how well Veeva has executed and gone the extra mile in this time of change. Now, I'd like to share a few additional highlights for the quarter by area. It was a very active quarter for Commercial Cloud. Veeva CRM continued to gain market share as we added 10 new SMB logos in the quarter and saw further expansions at enterprise customers. OpenData also had a record number of wins in the quarter. Adoption of Approved Email and Engage Meeting was very strong. And Commercial Cloud expanded in important ways in digital and with Data Cloud as I mentioned earlier, and also with Crossix Veeva to better connect sales and marketing. We're bringing Veeva CRM field activity data into the Crossix Veeva marketing analytics solutions to give brand marketers insights into how sales and marketing activities are working together. For example, brands can see the impact of media campaigns on doctors recently called on by the field. We have a bold vision for Commercial Cloud. The acquisition of Crossix and the announcement of Data Cloud is a big start. Commercial Cloud is about connecting customer facing teams, leveraging data and digital and solving for the specific needs of each major country and region. This is the type of strategic partners the industry needs in commercial. Our approach is resonating and giving us the opportunity to engage in even broader strategic planning with our customers. Turning to Vault, we just held our very first virtual summit two weeks ago. It was our R&D event for Europe and the feedback was very positive. We more than tripled attendance from last year and we're pleased to see the online event was really effective in advancing customer success and for restaurant selling. And looking at Vault development cloud progress, customers continue to adopt more Vault application. Vault QualitySuite is a good example and had a very strong quarter highlighted by another top 20 pharma selecting QualityDocs as their enterprise standard. This marks the 11th Top 20 to select QualityDocs. Clinical is another area where customers are standardizing on more Vault applications over time. This quarter and existing Top 20 pharma customer for CDMS, eTMF, and Study Startup will round out the full Vault clinical suite by adopting CTMS. Additionally, another European Top 20 decided to adopt eTMF and Study Startup as its enterprise standard after standardizing on RIM in Q4. We also announced that five of the seven top CROs have joined the Vault CDMS Partner Program. This is a very significant announcement and shows the increasing momentum of our CDMS product. Sponsors and CROs are like see that Vault CDMS has the potential to transform clinical data management. Now to our work outside Life Sciences and cosmetics and consumer goods, these industries have experienced major impacts from COVID-19. Cosmetic companies have seen a significant drop in demand, while CPG companies selling essential products have benefited from consumer stockpiling and have seen higher demand for certain products. Our team continues to execute Well, this quarter and new top 10 CPG companies selected QualityOne for an initial deployment. Since the onset of the pandemic, this customer has experienced a rapid spike in demand. To secure their supply chain, they needed to quickly establish and attract testing and auditing information for their suppliers. Our team was able to deliver a supplier quality management system within three weeks. So outside of Life Sciences business is experiencing some disruption due to COVID-19, I'm very proud of how they've continued to build Veeva's reputation for customer success, and as a trusted partner within these new industries. I'm also happy to announce that we've completed our search for our new CFO. He will start at Veeva in early June, we'll issue a formal announcement and share further details at that time. Tim is staying on to ensure a smooth transition and will remain an advisor to the company after the transition is complete. These have been tough times for everyone, but it's been inspiring to see what the industry and the Veeva teams have accomplished in such a short amount of time. I've never been more confident in Veeva's future. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Tim. Yes, Brent, thanks for the question. So in terms of the telemedicine and doctor visits yes from February to April 50% reduction in doctor visits, and that's something we see from the Crossix data in near real time, one or two days lag. So that's a tremendous asset that we have in Crossix. So I just wanted to take a moment there to recognize yes, that's a tremendous asset. We're going to leverage that in many ways. Now the other one, the 30%, what that was is of the doctor visits in April, 30% of them were done by telemedicine. So that was up from less than 1% in February. So clearly what it means is patients and doctors are interacting with each other over the Internet. Life Sciences sees that and they have to adapt to that. So what we're doing is more investment in Veeva Engage and other digital things in the commercial area to enable more virtual interactions between healthcare providers and doctors, rather than all of that happened to be in the office. And then we announced MyVeeva for clinical trials. And that's a software that will allow clinical research sites to interact more remotely with their patients when they need to, so they can have a mix of in-office and virtual visits. And then the last thing was adding the remote site monitoring to the -- our Site Vault product to allow the clinical research associates from pharma to view the patient records remotely, instead of having to go there and view them on the paper. So those are some things we're doing in general what it means is we will enable pharma to be more virtual and more digital on the R&D side, in clinical particularly, and then in the commercial side, so that they can have a mix of in-person and digital. Overall that will make the industry -- overall that will make the industry more efficient. And that's why I'm excited about it. They'll make the industry more efficient, and it'll bring more information to doctors, and it'll make it more convenient for patients. So it's a really a good thing overall, even though it's rough, the COVID-19 definitely, that's very hard to go through. But the benefit of it is this increased move to digital which will help everybody in the healthcare ecosystem. Well, I would say it's a major, I would say evolution of all our products and some of them are going to be new products as well. So yes I think evolution will bring our customers there for sure. But this will result in making existing products better and over time this will result in new products and it already has in MyVeeva. Thanks, Brent. Yes, Kirk I think our customers doing a great job first of all, they're working really hard. So that's bottom line, I think they're working extra hard. They're working, they're rising to the challenge. So a lot of nights and weekends, so they're really going after it. But they also think in long cycles, that's the nature of the business. So they know that, if they want to have a drug approved six years from now, they have to get going now. So they think in long-term cycles. So they continue to do things. Now there are emergency projects that happened with COVID, they have a drug candidate, they have to pivot, they have to do this and that, they have to produce a new diagnostic, et cetera. So there are emergency projects. But that's not for especially for a larger pharmaceutical company. That's not the preponderance of what they're working on their population, maybe they're working on 10% of the people are working on emergency projects. The rest of the 90% are working on the long-term things that they need to do to be successful as a provider of medicine to society. And that's the long-term gain. Now those emergency projects, some of those will go in our favor and new clinical trial that uses our type of system or there's a company that's doing that's producing ventilators for the first time and it's a coalition of quite a few companies, they needed the distributed quality system and they needed it in three weeks. Okay, we're the only one that can do that. Right, so we benefited from that emergency project. Sometimes there'll be an emergency projects, they don't relate to what we're doing, business process change, et cetera and then maybe one of our long-term investment type projects will be delayed because of that. But that's, that's on the margin and probably for us, the puts and takes are about equal. I'll start with that one. And then we can have Tim as well. Yes, certainly Veeva is a company that's built on customer intimacy. Customer relationships are deep for us and we've had our in-person summits. And our account executives live in the region, they are visiting customers often. Of course, we can't do that now. But we've been a very virtual company in terms of using Zoom and other products. So we'll continue to do that. We had our customer first customer summit virtually, it was quite effective at spreading knowledge. So I think largely we'll be okay. We'll be okay with that. Everybody likes to see people in-person. I'm missing our employees and our customers. But also, we're also confident in the life sciences industry, they're going to have a treatment, they're going to have a vaccine for this. I believe it's a matter of time. And then and then we'll get back to a more normal mix of digital and in-person, which is where we were before COVID. Tim, in particular, as it relates to financing, I'll pass it over to you. Thanks Sandy. We launched it in March. Now, that was something planned, right? That was something planned even before the acquisition closed with Crossix and we mobilized the new development team around Data Cloud, we did a lot of things. And we announced Data Cloud six months to the day after the acquisition was announced. Now that happened to be in the middle of March in the pandemic, when there were a lot of eyes on that on many other things. But we decided, hey, this is a long-term thing. We don't know when the pandemic stopping or starting and we need to go forward. This is a long-term thing. So we launched it was certainly noticed, but when you launch something big and new like this, for most people, hey the proofs in the pudding, you're going to do something. Let's see if you can do it. Now, the premise that we're on is that the industry needs choice A, which I believe is true. And they have not had choice, and B, that it needs innovation. So I view the existing data solutions, they really are not modern. They're the equivalent of client server software, when Veeva started, and yes, it's very difficult to uproot those entrenched players. In those days, it was difficult to uproot those deeply entrenched client server type of things, but you come with a better solution. You get early adopters and it starts to snowball. I feel that's what will happen here. It's the innovation that people are looking for, innovation in terms of timeliness and accuracy of patient data and completeness. The type of thing that I talked about with the telemedicine, how we knew in two days and we could track it daily. That's what life sciences would like to track about the interactions of their medicines with patients and doctors all in a privacy and safe way, they can't do that today. In terms of I'll give a little color on the two early adopters. One of them is a group of brand in a large Top 20 pharmaceutical company, they happen to be focusing on a relatively rare blood disorder. And that product is already in the market. And they're mapping patient journeys, not replacing anything. They're mapping patient journeys, which they couldn't do before with their data sources. And they're doing a double check on whether they're targeting the right physicians. Now, the other company is a platform company, it's a precision medicine platform company going what that means is they're engineering different types of DNA and RNA, they are a platform company with many candidates, don't have any candidates on the market yet, but they have some candidates close. So what they're doing for is patient journeys and physician targeting and overall patient population, they're trying to find out how many patients really can they target and how many doctors are really seeing those products on the market yet. So those are examples of things that are going on with Data Cloud would just focus really, really successful and innovate and I believe our business will grow from there. Yes, so as it relates to CROs and our CDMS or EDC product, there's also a large a couple large. Yes, it's going to have a little dip now, clinical trials slow down and have a boom and they start up, right. So that's dynamics. And then with CROs especially the large ones and the small ones, they're very customer focused companies. They are service oriented companies that really want to give the best service for their customers and what's happened and what's true in this five out of the seven, they're large CROs that are now prepared to offer their clinical trial services on Veeva technologies and Veeva tools prepared to operate the Veeva technology for the companies that don't want to operate themselves, which would largely be smaller biotechs. What's happening there is these companies, sponsors, small sponsors are coming to them and say, hey, we were interested in your CRO services, we really want you to use Veeva Technology that gets the CROs to pay attention. Now, why are the sponsors asking for that? Simply, we can build studies faster than the competition now, sometimes four weeks instead of an average of 12. And we can build more flexible studies. For example, oncology studies have amendments, the existing state-of-the-art in the industry is that data has to be unloaded and loaded, or a new amendment. That doesn't happen in our system. So it's better technology. Now, change takes time. This is a risk avoidance area of license, nor do we, nor do we want all the customers at once. Our largest clinical trial in EDC, huge trial with the company, their biggest trial ever was set to start in March was delayed actually, but good news is it's actually going to have its fate planned to have its first patient in the first week of June here, so just a few days. So that's really what we're focused on is customer success in the CDMS market. Thanks. Yes, let's see at high level, yes I'm quite more confident than ever in the $3 billion and that's because part of it is just passage of time, we're getting closer to 2025 and no bad things happen. Part of it is that but a part of it is we spend a lot of time building a great team here, a great, a great culture and innovation engine. And now you see this tremendous stress point of three months. And that's when good companies and good management teams that are prepared step-up. So that's what I felt and seen at Veeva, this innovation that will lead to better customer relationships, better innovation. So that's why I'm feeling quite confident in the future. And Gosh, I didn't write it down Bryan. So feel confident in 2025 in the future, but you had a specific question there and I didn't write it down excuse me. Yes, hiring. So my main message is if any of you have people out there that would like to work at Veeva specially extra to the software engineering et cetera. We are hiring. Yes, we're definitely hiring because of the innovation that's going on. So we're hiring, we're finding a good hiring environment too, we're getting good quality candidates. And the interview process is a little faster. So we think it's a great time to load up on great talent. In times of stress like this, there's a flight to quality. And companies want to do business with quality companies that they can count on.  And people want to work for quality companies that they can count on. So I think it's going to be a real boost for our hiring. I think as it relates to little different by region, China being different than Japan and Korea for example, but in general, it's a vigilant, it's a return to gradually to a guarded way of going about your normal business, certainly much more, not too big, large group events, clean your hands temptation, et cetera because everybody knows there's no vaccine yet. There's no highly effective treatment. So you have to be careful. So they're getting about their business, but they're being more careful, I would expect that in the U.S. and other countries that where we're going to slowly return to that, a very careful return to visiting people staying away from large groups. And now then we would need that before we can fully get back to the larger group gatherings. Yes, that's a good one. I think what we're seeing is really an acceleration of what the industry was going to go through anyways, just over a longer period of time. So the industry was on track, was on pace to adopt digital and we saw that adoption. It was steadily increasing. And with COVID, with lockdown, the industry was now forced to accelerate that. And I think we saw, probably two or three years of digital transformation happening within just a couple of months. But what's been remarkable is I have never seen in my career, this shift over literally three months to turn on digital channels. So it's quite remarkable. And I will call out shamelessly that made that technology to allow our customers to be able to turn on, but also to our customers for putting the foundation in place to be ready and to be prepared. So the shift happened a whole lot faster. I do think obviously, we can't predict what happens with this pandemic, but I think it's going to make the industry more efficient. We're already seeing some of those benefits, the product is working are getting really deep engagement with customers. And just like with telehealth and telemedicine, we're seeing more patients do telemedicine and they actually like it. So they're going to do more of it. I think that same analogy is true here, where doctors are more comfortable engaging digitally, where farmers are more comfortable engaging digitally, and they'll do more of it over time, they're starting to see that really appreciate the benefits of moving to digital faster. First MyVeeva, that's really about enabling the clinical research sites and the patients, thousands of them around the world and really just transforming the clinical research process for the whole industry. And when I say industry there, I mean, the patient's clinical research sites and sponsors, everybody involved. And there's a tremendous amount of excitement in that in Veeva. We're going to help bring medicines, to critical medicines to patients faster than they otherwise would. And that's, that's a really great feeling. And that will help our business in the life sciences area, in the clinical area. Yes, we're giving the products for free to clinical research sites. But that'll over time I believe have a great business to our clinical business overall within Life Sciences, CDMS, CTMS, our whole clinical operations suite. So that is one and then sorry, I didn't read that. Your second question was, do I see that going into more telehealth and that type of thing? Yes, MyVeeva is to enable a remote visit from a doctor to a patient in a clinical trial. But I don't see Veeva going into the telemedicine business broadly, which is that's something different. I think you'll see the people that provide the EMRs and other things for the normal caregiving. Yes, that's not for us at this time. We wouldn't be in that area. Some of the technology ideas are the same. But it's a really different market and you really have to focus and that's not an area we would focus on. I'll pick that one, to sales and engagement inside of Life Sciences. I think it's been high. Our account executives has been gosh busier than ever helping customers, helping communicate giving them the information they need. I would say, myself and the executive team boy, we've been on Zooms more customers than we had before because it's just a time of an intense pressure cooker right of information. So these sales engagements, I do think they'll bear fruit. Over the long-term, we have long sales cycles, we develop relationships. In terms of the CPG that also happened in CPG. But I think CPG had more, relatively speaking to the percentage of what they had going on. They had more emergency projects, more supply chain things that they had to go on. So yes, conversations probably strengthened a bit, maybe not so much as they did in life sciences. Yes, Bhavan this is Peter. Yes, you're thinking about it correctly, we refer to that as the clinical suite. Customers are seeing that if they can have the sort of straight through processing and pre-built integrations from our clinical data management suite, to our clinical operations suite and have a full Veeva end-to-end experience in a clinical, there's material benefits and productivity for their people, for their operational people and their IT team. So and that's more pronounced in the larger companies, because they have more scale. And so then, then more integration and optimization gives them more benefits. So that's exactly the network effect. It's a network effect between clinical operations and between clinical data management and then if you get at a higher level, there's really a network effect between having on your whole development cloud on Veeva, the quality and manufacturing, the regulatory, the clinical operations, clinical data management. And now since we've introduced safety and have some customers live on safety, they see the potential of it, you get an integrated suite of things. And that's compelling. It's a compelling message and it's driving some of the demand. In terms of competitive environment haven't seen any particular change. I think all companies at this time are focused on taking care of their customers and their internal operations. So it's still the same. And I think our advantage on it is we have, it's back to the basics. We have 100% Cloud based, real time real cloud clinical data management system. There's two other large competitors in history that don't have that, every clinical data management customer Veeva is on exactly the same release. That's not the case with the other two. It's real cloud technology. And it's newer and more harder, more modern and then integrated with the whole suite. So those are our lasting advantages. And from now it's just customer success and focusing on that, so we really haven't seen any changes in the competitive environment. We have seen, I would say at our R&D Summit, two weeks ago, our first virtual summit, which was gosh triple the attendance from last year was a really great summit. There's a couple impactful presentations by customers, good sized customers in certainly in the top 50 companies, and they just were about the basics, we were able to build our studies in four weeks much faster than we could before. And we're very happy with the nimbleness and the way we can run an agile trial. So those customer success stories in those public forums, they can change their competitive dynamics in our favor over time. So, thank you everyone for joining the call today. I'd like to thank our customers one more time for all the work they're doing to combat the pandemic. And I would like to thank the entire Veeva team for all your work supporting those customers. I'm really proud to work with you every day. Thanks very much."

            "content": "Hey, Bryan, thanks. This is Paul. I'll take that one. And yes you're right. I mean, but first, I want to just kind of take a step back on the Engage side and just Veeva super proud and I'm super pleased with the Veeva team for coming together and being able to help the industry, if you think about what's happening out there is the sales channel has fundamentally shut down is largely shut down pretty much across the globe. It's starting to open up a little bit in different markets and countries and segments. And we've been able to help the industry turn that channel back on and we've been able to help them do that through things like, so feels really good to be able to the industry up lead the industry really getting into digital a whole lot faster which is just testament to the product team is so really pleased about that movement has happened and you're right really significant kind of adoption. One way that we think about the adoption is just utilization. And that's really the most important, it's the most important metric because doesn't matter so much how many people have and we're seeing that utilization, if you look at February compared with April. So we're really pleased with that shift and the industry is really starting to understand and appreciating and each week, we're continuing to see more and more adoption and more and more utilization of the product. And that's what we're focused on right now is just continuing that adoption and helping our customers be able to get the most out of using Engage. Hey Sterling, this is Paul. I'll comment on the key drivers from an industry perspective, and then I'll turn it over to Tim to talk a little bit about the performance. So, I think Tim alluded to this a little bit earlier with the idea that we're not so dependent on trial by trial. So as individual trials are being paused or delayed and generally we're not seeing cancellations, it's really just a shifting. That generally doesn't have an impact. So the projects that we're working on, these are projects and deals that have been budgeted and that have been kind of in the pipeline for some period of time. So that is kind of continued momentum. There is also a sense that in times like these, you need to be more efficient. So there is a little bit of a tailwind, just in terms of companies thinking about accelerating some of these projects where they're able to improve efficiency, improve productivity. So I think that's a bit of the tailwind that we're seeing as well. I'll turn it over to Tim to talk a little about the performance side."

Just a quick reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Now at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ato Garrett, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nAto Garrett: Good afternoon, and welcome to Veeva's Fiscal 2022 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Conference Call for the quarter and year ended January 31, 2022. As a reminder, we posted prepared remarks on Veeva's Investor Relations website just after 1:00 p.m. Pacific today. We hope you've had a chance to read them before the call. Today's call will be used primarily for Q&A. With me today for Q&A are Peter Gassner, our Chief Executive Officer; Paul Shawah, EVP of Commercial Strategy; and Brent Bowman, our Chief Financial Officer.\n During this call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding trends, our strategies and the anticipated performance of the business, including guidance regarding future financial results. These forward-looking statements will be based on our current views and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially.\n Please refer to the risks listed in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our most recent filing on Form 10-Q. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today, March 2, 2022 based on the facts available to us today. If this call is replayed or viewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or active information. Veeva disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We may discuss our guidance on today's call, but we will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum.\n On the call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today's earnings release and in the supplemental investor presentation, both of which are available on our website.\n With that, thank you for joining us. And now, I'll turn the call over to Peter. \nPeter Gassner: Thank you, Ato, and welcome, everyone, to the call. It was a great quarter and a year of execution for Veeva, with strength across the business and results above our guidance. Total revenue and subscription revenue for the quarter were each up 23%, and we posted a 38% operating margin. Total revenue for the year was up 26% to $1.85 billion, and our operating margin was 41%. We also continued to track ahead of our 2025 targets.\n Things are going well. We have a great team and are attracting new people who believe in our values and want to be part of our mission. And our partnership with the industry continues to become more strategic. Our innovation engine is strong. And we're executing well in established areas and newer areas. This sets Veeva up for a long runway of organic growth and profitability as we deliver more value to the industry.\n And we'll now open it up -- open up the call to your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first this afternoon to Brent Bracelin at Piper Sandler. \nBrent Bracelin: Peter, maybe I'll start with you in the script here in the prepared remarks. You do mention something about seeing some challenges around larger deals and closing deals and some projects taking a little longer to close. Can you just maybe talk about is that a shortage on talent on your side, being able to service the client? Or is it really around things that you're seeing and feeling in the customer side of the equation here? \nPeter Gassner: Yes, Brent, this is Peter. What we're seeing is, overall, there's a bit of a talent shortage in the industry that affects us and that affects our customers as well. We have -- the industry is really growing. And as you know, the labor pool is a little bit shrinking in the U.S. So that causes a bit of a talent shortage. We need more people. We have to train up people. But I would say that's a slight one, and I feel comfortable about it. We had a great hiring quarter. We're training a lot of new people how to do things in the industry. So I think that will work its way out.\n And then the other one you mentioned is the large deals. That's something different. Those are just -- we're seeing larger deals than we've ever seen before, some of them in companies that are maybe in the top 40 to the top 15 or so companies. They might look to be going all-in with Veeva, things they haven't done before on the R&D side and in Development Cloud. Some top 10s are looking sort of to go all-in with us in Clinical. These are large things and they take time to work themselves through. So 2 different factors you asked about there. \nBrent Bracelin: Helpful color. And just one quick follow-up on Clinical. That seems to be an area where you continue to have very good success, particularly around kind of the digital trials, broader CDMS adoption, broader CTMS adoption here. What's resonating there? And would you say Clinical adoption is happening as you expected in the last year? Or are things happening a little quicker than you anticipated in the last year? \nPeter Gassner: Certainly, what's happening there is we're on our way to becoming the leader in Clinical. We started out with a broad vision to be the leader in Clinical many years ago, and that starts with putting in that anchor of eTMF, and we're really the leader there and still expanding there. And then CTMS, we got good success there. We're on our way to being the leader there. Then CDMS, we got our early customers live, very happy. Now we're planting these new seeds of digital trials, things like ePRO and Site Connect, eConsent.\n So our Clinical Suite is getting very broad, and we're the only vendor -- only technology company that's trying to attack it broadly and also reinvent it at the same time. So momentum is very good, and it's a long-term play. We're super happy with Clinical. I saw our first demo of one of our new applications about 2 weeks ago, our ePRO, the ones that the patients are directly going to use. And I think it's going to be the world-beating application, but it's new and it will change things. It will change the industry, so it takes time to adopt. \nOperator: We'll take our next question now from Saket Kalia at Barclays. \nSaket Kalia: Peter, maybe just to start with you. I would love to dig into Data Cloud a little bit. Really interesting remark in the prepared comments about sort of comparing that to Vault in the early days. Can you just talk about that comparison a little bit? A lot of us on the call remember that. And maybe just the extension to that question is what's been the feedback that you've gotten from those early adopters on Data Cloud about how the product stacks up against competitors out there? Does that make sense? \nPeter Gassner: Yes. Very good. Yes. When I compared to Vault is our Data business overall, which has multiple components, it has Link in there, it has Data Cloud in there, it has OpenData in there, and what we're finding there, we're making multiple data products and we're finding a way to fit them together in a nice cohesive data architecture that customers can start consuming in different areas. And that's very similar to Vault, nice architecture in the way of doing things. And yes, some people might start in Regulatory or they might start in Clinical or they might start in Quality. But then they all fit together and get more valuable as you have more parts.\n So that's what I mean about -- that's the hallmark of Veeva. We make excellent solutions that stand on their own, multiple different points of entry, and then we move forward. So -- and in terms of the specific use cases, I think it is good to dive into how Data Cloud is a bit different. Paul, do you want to take that one and maybe what some of our early adopters are doing with Data Cloud? \nPaul Shawah: Yes, sure. And this is an area where we're very clearly focused on kind of the early adopter phase of the market, maturing the product, product excellence. I'll give you 1 or 2 customer examples because they're real and they're super interesting. One is a top 10 pharma company in one of their brand teams for a very specific use case. This is a specialty product. And specialty products are delivered through specialty pharmacies, and some specialty pharmacies block the access to the sales of that data. So which means the brand team can't see how much of it is being sold through that specialty pharmacy, it's this thing called block.\n So that's like having a blind spot. They can't see what's happening. And they came to us and they asked us if we could help fill that blind spot in for them, if we can provide that visibility. And we're actually -- because we -- because of what Peter talked about, the modern way that we source and assemble and bring all our data together, we essentially, in a sense, unblocked a lot of the things that they couldn't see with their legacy provider.\n So this is just one use case in a top 10 pharma company, 1 brand. This company probably markets 25 or 30 products. So when you think about that, that's patient data in a very small part of that company. And what happens is that, that starts to go viral in that company. So we're just building confidence in the data set, and the market is starting to see that.\n One other interesting example. It happens to be with one of the top vaccine manufacturers, is they were asking us about our vaccine visibility. And we used Data Cloud, our patient data, to look at the vaccine trends. And we found the trend and they said, \"Hey, wait. That's wrong.\" It was a very specific trend. There was a very specific dip at the time in the marketplace. And they questioned our data. And together, we dug into it with them and they actually learned something that they didn't expect, that they were surprised to learn. And they validated that our data was accurate.\n So we're teaching customers new things with our data, and we're building confidence in -- our product excellence is working. So that's playing out through the marketplace. It's going to take time. These are really complex companies, and it takes time for that to work through the system. But it's playing out really nicely in the early part of the market. \nSaket Kalia: Got it. That's really helpful. Brent, maybe for you as a follow-up. Very helpful commentary in the prepared remarks again, just around Commercial subscription revenue, roughly that 60-40 split, right, around kind of pricing based on a per rep and not per rep basis. And -- or rather CRM versus non-CRM, maybe is the better way to put it, right? And so I was wondering if you could just maybe talk about sort of the relative growth profiles across those 2 parts of the Commercial business as you look at fiscal '23, even broad-brush. \nBrent Bowman: Yes. No, happy to, Saket. So if you take a look at fiscal year '23 guide, the primary drivers of that growth is going to be on that nonrep-based piece. So think about prospects of our marketing -- advanced marketing analytics product as well as Link and our content, Vault content product suite, that is really going to be the primary driver. The more traditional CRM and add-on business will be more steady, slight grower. I would think of it from that perspective. \nOperator: We go next now to Ken Wong with Guggenheim Securities. \nHoi-Fung Wong: Maybe it's for Peter or maybe Brent. Just as we look at the Clinical growth on subscription, it did decel again from 39% to 34%. I guess what's the key driver that -- is that just purely because those are typically the larger deals and that's where you're seeing some -- maybe some near-term pressure? I would love any color you can give in terms of what the impact is. \nPeter Gassner: Yes. Ken, this is Peter. I'm really happy with that 34% growth on what is becoming a larger number these days. So it's just the way that the deals are falling out and the product suite is getting larger. CDMS is very early in its revenue curve, CDMS, and then Digital Trials hasn't even really started. So I think that's what you're seeing, numbers getting larger. CDMS is really getting a lot of traction, but not contributing very much from a revenue point of view because these are large deals oftentimes that ramp.\n Now if you want leading indicators on Clinical, if you look in that script, one of the most meaningful lines in there was that 1 of the top 6 CROs switched to Veeva as their preferred CDMS. When a sponsor asks them to run a trial, that's a big deal. That will start a trend. So that's really good validation. So yes, really happy with our Clinical business. \nHoi-Fung Wong: Got it. Really appreciate the color there. And then, Brent, I see that billings is kind of no longer part of the disclosures. I guess as we think about our model, I know, in the past, you typically steered us towards it to kind of track with subscription growth. Is that still the right framework as we look ahead? And any kind of seasonal elements that we should be thinking about on that number? \nBrent Bowman: So Ken, I just want to make sure we're in sync. We did provide a guide on billings for the year. So we began -- guided fiscal year '23 to $2.32 billion, growing at about 19%. So we're excited about the momentum we're seeing in the business that's translating into our guide of billings for the year. \nHoi-Fung Wong: Yes. Okay. Sorry about that. Yes, we're having issues. We couldn't get onto the IR side. So I was kind of going off of the press release. But I appreciate that. Well, in that case then, thank you for the clarification. I'm good on my end. \nOperator: We go next now to Rishi Jaluria at RBC Capital Markets. \nRichard Poland: This is Richard calling on for Rishi. I guess just a quick question on the -- a follow-up on the pharma rep reduction. I know, last quarter, you said that it was a minimal impact in the quarter. And you pointed to the noncore CRM pieces being now 40%. But just kind of as we look into fiscal '23 and fiscal '24, are you still seeing the same 10% rep reduction and that impact on the core CRM business? And just kind of, I guess, any update over the last 90 days on that piece? \nPaul Shawah: Yes. Richard, this is Paul. I can give you an update. In terms of rep reductions, what we saw in Q4 was exactly -- pretty much exactly as we had expected and anticipated. We did see some reductions that we had planned for and anticipated. So no surprises there.\n We also didn't see anything that would cause us to change any of our thinking around this overall 10%, which has been playing out starting last year. It will play out mostly through this year and partly into next year. So really no change on any of that thinking. It's playing out much as we expected. \nOperator: We go next now to Dylan Becker with William Blair. \nDylan Becker: I guess maybe first for Peter, too. So kind of a record customer add year here. And as you continue to mature, some of your R&D solutions in the platform today, I guess, how are you thinking about, again, the pace of adoption of some of these earlier offerings, right?\n So it seems like CDMS, CTMS, [ some particulars ], then Safety, [ some of those big tools ], are seeing a more rapid uptick. Is it solely again the value of the integration across the platform that's driving that? And how are you guys thinking about, I mean, factoring in that uptick from an innovation standpoint, again, going forward? As you add new solutions, should we think about it as incremental accelerated kind of adoption for those solutions just given the fact that it's an incremental value-add to the customers? \nPeter Gassner: Yes, Dylan. I guess the way to think about that adoption is what drives the adoption. I would say, product excellence, number one, having the best product in the market and staying with it, building the best product in the market, that's hard work. We got to hire the best product people and have quite a strong vision. And so that's going well, and then we're very good at that. I would say the other thing is relationships. When you're bringing something into large enterprises, relationships really help. That's where our multiproduct approach really helps.\n And these products, we have a lot of early products. If you look at -- they're making progress, but they're very early in their revenue cycle, Safety, very, very early; Data Cloud, extremely early; even CDMS, very early. Not to mention some of the Digital Trials things, some other products we have. So progress really starts a long way before the revenue. So I'm really happy with the progress, and it will lead to good revenue over time. \nDylan Becker: That's great. Yes, I appreciate the color there. Maybe one other one too, and maybe more for -- more so for Brent. But as we think about kind of the back half ramp maybe in the year, right, so how should we be thinking about kind of the impact of hiring the project starts here and how it's kind of factored in from a recovery standpoint through that back-end acceleration and maybe as well to thinking of kind of the uptick in -- or as you see an uptick in professional service, how that kind of flows through as a contributor to the subscription dynamic as well? \nBrent Bowman: Yes. So yes, thanks, Dylan. So when we look at the deal progressions, we saw that the bookings linearity was slightly more weighted towards the back half of the year. And so we are seeing good momentum of deals progressing, and that's having about a $15 million impact overall to revenue that we called out.\n That has lent itself to the fact that we think we will be accelerating on the back half of the year from a revenue subscription perspective. So we are informed through the conversations we're having with customers. And as Peter mentioned, we're really progressing some large deals nicely. Professional services plays in that nicely. That's a really nice growing business. We're excited about it. And we're continuing to build and add talent to that team. \nOperator: We go next now to Ryan MacDonald at Needham & Company. \nRyan MacDonald: Peter, maybe for you first. I'm curious on Veeva Engage. Obviously, as we are broadly, I think, hopefully approaching the return to normal here and travel opening up again, I'm curious what the renewals have looked like for Veeva Engage and if you're seeing any similar trends that we're seeing more broadly with sort of video meeting platform vendors in terms of sort of less usage here and if that could have sort of a double impact on Commercial over time with sort of not only fewer pharma reps, but then also maybe a shift away from more video-based meetings, to return in-person. \nPaul Shawah: Yes. Hey, Ryan. This is Paul. I can take that. I track those numbers pretty closely with Engage. First, the renewals have been very strong into this year. And last year, into this year, utilization was really high. The utilization will go up and down with offices opening and closing. And just preferences, we're focused together with the industry on helping the industry become more hybrid, operate either from the doctor's office or from their home office, and do that very seamlessly.\n I'm really proud of the team. We've built a really strong product in core CRM and Engage to enable this hybrid way of working. And that hybrid way of working is here to stay. Most every company, every customer that I talk to, they're thinking about hybrid ways of working, sometimes digital, sometimes in -- physically in an office. So although the utilization will go up and down, it's something that is just here to stay and it's going to be kind of how they do business going forward.\n So I think the renewals will continue in Engage. And particularly as we continue to innovate in that product, we're making it -- we're adding -- interestingly adding things into the product where even if you're in an office, Engage becomes valuable, where you can share content, let's say, 6 feet apart. That's part of the Engage platform. So our customers really appreciate that kind of innovation. So we're excited about helping to move the industry to hybrid and also the road map of innovation there. \nRyan MacDonald: And perhaps, just a quick follow-up on that. In terms of the pace of the migration of the industry there, do you feel that the current environment is such that the pharma companies are sort of obviously cutting headcount here and then just sort of evaluating the productivity levels of what they have remaining before making sort of those incremental, more hybrid or virtual investments?\n Or are you starting to see a faster sort of adoption of those additional areas? Just trying to understand how quickly we could see perhaps that 40% nonrep-based component evolve over time. \nPaul Shawah: Yes. So when they -- first of all, what has driven some of their productivity gains is the adoption of more technology, the utilization of digital. And Veeva's played a big part in that. That was part of our strategy, help make the industry more productive.\n So now, they get the benefit of that productivity. And what they're able to do with that is, of course, take some of that as reductions. They're able to use that -- those dollars to either invest in more digital or to invest in other areas. Like as they do digital over the long term, they need better data as one example. So that could lead to tailwinds for areas like Link and helping them figure out who they need to reach digitally, Data Cloud becoming more precise about how they do digital engagement.\n So this is something that's going to play out over many, many years, the shift to digital. It's not a fast thing that happens. But I think the number of reps will hit a new steady state, and then the industry will continue to evolve and adopt new digital capabilities and also new data and analytics sets from Veeva and more broadly. \nOperator: We go next now to Stan Zlotsky at Morgan Stanley. \nRyan Bressner: You have Ryan Bressner on for Stan. I guess just maybe first, maybe talk about Vault outside of life sciences. How are you thinking about that business going into FY '23 now that maybe some of the COVID headwinds are starting to subside? \nPeter Gassner: Yes, the business there, I think you're right, COVID headwinds has largely normalized in that business outside of life sciences. So there, we're focused on large customers in consumer products and chemicals, so things like your basic consumer goods, actually food,  consumer health care, cosmetics and specialty chemicals. And we're focused on company -- large companies largely, companies of $5 billion in revenue and above.\n And if you look where we're focused, Regulatory and Quality and Safety, that's kind of where we're going to help them -- Safety has a different meaning than inside life sciences. It's not the drug safety. It's safety of employees, safety -- and safety of environment. So pretty focused there, and I think seems got good momentum and steady as she goes there. It's going to be a nice, steady, growing business for us. \nRyan Bressner: Helpful. Maybe just one more then. You talked last quarter a bit about MedTech CRM. Just kind of curious if you have any updates on the opportunity there and how that could maybe work into your existing relationship with Salesforce? \nPeter Gassner: Yes. MedTech CRM, we announced that last quarter. So overall, the MedTech business for us is going well, and it's largely on the Vault side, on the R&D side. It's the Quality, Regulatory, Clinical area, Commercial content. But we did announce MedTech CRM, and that was done very openly with Salesforce, who's been a great partner of ours for 15 years.\n 15-year partnerships in technology, that doesn't happen very often. So yes, we partner there in pharma with Salesforce. It's just early in MedTech CRM that we're doing on Vault, and we're just talking to some customers who may become early adopters. We're building the product. So we don't really have any progress to report. We're having a lot of good customer conversations. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We go next now to Kirk Materne at Evercore. \nAdwait Adi Ahire: This is Adi Ahire asking on behalf of Kirk. But I just wanted to ask, you guys acquired Veracity a couple of months ago now and which is now being offered as Veeva RTSM. But can you talk a little bit about how that's going so far, the future product -- the future growth of this product and your thoughts on M&A moving forward?\n And just kind of a follow-up, like does more M&A kind of make sense with all the organic developments that you guys are kind of making? Just any thoughts on that? \nPeter Gassner: We're very happy with the RTSM acquisition. I'll take a little bit of time on that. It's feeling great, I have to say. I'm a bit more involved in that one than I am in some other things. And it's a small team and -- but they had a very robust product that they've developed over more than 10 years. But they didn't have a channel and a way really to sell that product.\n So that team is feeling really energized as part of Veeva. We've added to the team. We have a new general manager for that area that came from the Veeva side. He is engaged because he has a new job and a new thing to do. And we actually won a few new deals and net new logos. It's really feeling good.\n Now in terms of acquisition strategy, still, we would -- whenever we look to go into a new market, we would look, is that the right type of thing we can buy? Or do we build or do we partner? Oftentimes, you're not going to find the right thing to buy, sometimes you are. And in this case, we did. And so our strategy really hasn't changed, and we're very happy with our RTSM acquisition. \nOperator: We take our next question now from Joe Vruwink at Baird. \nJoseph Vruwink: Veeva obviously had a very strong year in the Quality category. And Quality seems to be receiving a bit of an elevated focus, just in general, based on some of the recent news and based on some big transactions in the space.\n Do you think the role of that product set in your customers is changing or evolving so that, ultimately, it can command a bigger footprint? I think about Veeva rank-ordering its Vault products in the past. Has the overall opportunity for Quality actually grown so that it might be more consequential going forward than it might have been several years prior? \nPeter Gassner: Yes. Certainly, Quality is a big area for us and still relatively early, and it's growing in 2 ways. The footprint is getting bigger. So training was something we added, and that's now starting to do well. We bought what's called the GXP content. That's very early. That's starting to ramp. We announced a big new product, laboratory information management system, which is the way pharmaceutical companies test the quality of their products. That's a very strategic and big area. So it's growing in its number of applications.\n And then the places where we're bringing it is also growing. So Quality is one of those things -- over time, we'll probably have 1,000 Quality customers or more. We have roughly 450 or so now. So Quality will go far and wide and be a really big business for us over time. So you're right to pick up on that. \nJoseph Vruwink: Okay. Great. And then maybe a question for Brent. Just on the back end-weighted nature of billings growth in this year, it seems like maybe starting the year with mid-teens growth and then exiting closer to 20% growth. Can that 20%-type number start to inform kind of how we should view growth, and I know it's early, but growth in fiscal 2024 if you're exiting at that type of level? \nBrent Bowman: Yes. So regarding our guide for the year, so I think looking at the full year number is the best way to kind of look at the overall strength of the business from a billings perspective at 19%, not to provide any sort of guidance for '24 at this point in time, but we are excited about the momentum we're seeing in the business, the scale of the deals, the breadth of the deals. And as we look out to 2025 and beyond, we're clearly tracking ahead of our 2025 goals. So we're very optimistic. \nOperator: We go next now to Stephanie Davis at SVB Leerink. \nStephanie Davis Demko: You made some comments on the hybrid environment earlier as we go between in-person and Engage. So I was hoping we could draw some parallels to some of the virtual care players. Are there any pockets of providers or departments that will generally require more in-person rep meetings, especially as you go into more of a MedTech-y kind of environment?\n And are there any pockets that you think will be able to more fully lean in to Engage communications, similar to how the behavioral health, for example, has gone more fully onto virtual care? \nPaul Shawah: Yes, that's a good insightful one. And you're absolutely right. We do see those nuances and differences across therapeutic areas. And we can see that at a pretty granular level. So we can compare oncology with neurology, with cardiovascular space. We can look at different segments. And we see differences there. And those differences are often related to some of the things that you just described. Their level of comfort with doing telemedicine is one indicator. If they're -- if they tend to do that more as part of their traditional practice, they tend to be more comfortable doing an Engage meeting with a pharma.\n So we translate -- there is some translation there. There's some other factors that come into play, the regional nature where some of these customers are. Some customers are getting reached now digitally, that weren't previously reached before in-person. So there -- some companies are expanding their customer target sets that they're able to reach.\n So we see those nuances. We help our customers get visibility into that so they can be more effective. They can start to benchmark themselves. And that's where our Business Consulting comes into play. We're able to be that very strategic partner to our customer, giving them kind of really precise guidance. So yes, it's a key trend we see and watch and help our customers think through. \nStephanie Davis Demko: That's helpful. Can I shift gears real quick just over to the Development Cloud side? I was hoping you could help us frame the trend of greater end-to-end outsourcing on pharma biotech companies and kind of what the puts and takes are across trial complexity and cost and success rate that's impacting this, especially in the terms of a reopen, knock on wood, and how that impacts your win rates versus some of your potentially more incumbent competitors as the shift happens. \nPeter Gassner: Stephanie, yes, I think that trend of outsourcing in-source, that's largely net-neutral to us at Veeva. I don't see a big change in that, any kind of a macro change. It's really net-neutral. Now if we look at those small biotechs, what are the first things they need, they will need a Quality product and that they always have to have their own Quality records. That's just basic. So I see no change there.\n And then the next thing they will need is probably the Clinical area, and that is where, especially for the small biotech, Veeva making progress in the CRO channel, the contract research organization channel, becoming the preferred provider of the Clinical Data Management, that's what -- that is what's going to help us there. \nOperator: We go next now to Brian Peterson at Raymond James. \nBrian Peterson: So I wanted to start, and maybe this is for Paul, but just on PromoMats and maybe on MedComms. It sounded like that was a driver of growth year-over-year. You know what, I believe in the past, when it used to be just the Vault business, there was some discussion on maybe that had hit a saturation point. But it sounds like that's not the case.\n So I would be curious, as some of your customers kind of rethink their commercial strategies, are we seeing incremental adoption for MedComms and PromoMats. I would be curious to get your thoughts there. \nPaul Shawah: Yes. That's a good one, Brian. And the answer is yes, we are. And a couple of things are driving that. So we're seeing expansion within some existing customers. They're expanding their use to additional users and in some cases, even additional markets as they need to become more efficient in the content space. So expansions with existing customers, but we're also seeing because of digital, the demand for digital content. And once you become more digital, the speed of content, you need to be faster.\n So we're helping our customers get to new levels of speed with innovation areas like modular content, for example. So there -- our customers are innovating, we're innovating with them and helping them become more efficient. So expansions in existing customers, driving the new levels of efficiency with things like modular content is in -- because of digital, all is driving some of the uptick that you're seeing. \nBrian Peterson: And Brent, maybe one for you. I mean you guys had given a lot of detail about the rep decline and the 10% and the timing. I think the question that we get a lot is we're only seeing that in the financials. So if we think about just given how much of your renewal base is tied to the fourth quarter, is this last quarter that was just reported, is that going to be the biggest headwind to billings given the revenue and the renewal impact? Or how do we think about this? \nBrent Bowman: Yes. Hey, Brian. So what we've said is we expect most of the sales rep reductions of the 10% to happen by the end of fiscal year '23. So we're on that path. We didn't see anything that was unusual or surprising to us in this last Q4. And as you should expect, that the revenue impact to slightly trail the reduction in the pharma reps in the billings. So there's a little bit of a lag there on how it flows through the financials. But nothing's changed from what we've seen previously, and it's all incorporated into our guidance. \nOperator: And our last question this afternoon will come from Brad Sills of Bank of America. \nBradley Sills: I just wanted to ask, and apologies if you answered the question already, but the hiring impact, was that more on the customer side, they're lagging hiring plans, getting projects started? Or is it more on your side, hiring sales personnel and whatnot to help close the deals, to get the deals started? \nPeter Gassner: Yes, Brad. This is Peter. I'll take that. I would say it's a bit of both, right, the industry overall. I think you're talking about a pharmaceutical company, whether it's Pfizer or Novartis or Veeva, and so the industry is growing. And so we need more talent and kind of specialized talent, and so we're having trouble getting enough people and manufacturing those people. So it's a slowdown, is both, from both of those things.\n Now in the grand scheme of things, you have to remember, a pretty minor slowdown and no change to the competitive environment. On our side, yes, those types of people that you would expect, sales and services people. But the good news is we had a strong hiring quarter, and we're training a lot of new people about the industry. So we think we'll come out of this very strong. \nBradley Sills: That's great to hear, Peter. And one more, if I may. Just anything on CTMS, CDMS deals in that top 50 segment this quarter, and just pipelines, how does that segment look? \nPeter Gassner: Yes. I would say I'm very optimistic about that segment. We really won't talk about -- we mentioned the CRO that picked Veeva as their primary CDMS, now that was a really big one. A CTMS win in the top 20 as well. But the pipeline is really progressing for Clinical, both in CDMS, CTMS, some combo deals across CTMS and CDMS. I'm very excited about that. Momentum, and you can feel it when it happens, it doesn't show up in the financials for a while. And we can definitely feel the Clinical momentum right now. \nOperator: And that is all the questions we have for today. Mr. Gassner, back to you, sir, for any closing comments. \nPeter Gassner: All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. And thank you to our customers for your continued partnership and to the Veeva team for your outstanding work in the quarter and the year. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. And again, ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's Veeva Systems Fiscal 2022 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Call. I would like to thank you all so much for joining us and wish you all a great day. Goodbye.",

            "content": "Thank you, Ato, and welcome, everyone, to the call. It was a great quarter and a year of execution for Veeva, with strength across the business and results above our guidance. Total revenue and subscription revenue for the quarter were each up 23%, and we posted a 38% operating margin. Total revenue for the year was up 26% to $1.85 billion, and our operating margin was 41%. We also continued to track ahead of our 2025 targets.\n Things are going well. We have a great team and are attracting new people who believe in our values and want to be part of our mission. And our partnership with the industry continues to become more strategic. Our innovation engine is strong. And we're executing well in established areas and newer areas. This sets Veeva up for a long runway of organic growth and profitability as we deliver more value to the industry.\n And we'll now open it up -- open up the call to your questions. Yes, Brent, this is Peter. What we're seeing is, overall, there's a bit of a talent shortage in the industry that affects us and that affects our customers as well. We have -- the industry is really growing. And as you know, the labor pool is a little bit shrinking in the U.S. So that causes a bit of a talent shortage. We need more people. We have to train up people. But I would say that's a slight one, and I feel comfortable about it. We had a great hiring quarter. We're training a lot of new people how to do things in the industry. So I think that will work its way out.\n And then the other one you mentioned is the large deals. That's something different. Those are just -- we're seeing larger deals than we've ever seen before, some of them in companies that are maybe in the top 40 to the top 15 or so companies. They might look to be going all-in with Veeva, things they haven't done before on the R&D side and in Development Cloud. Some top 10s are looking sort of to go all-in with us in Clinical. These are large things and they take time to work themselves through. So 2 different factors you asked about there. Certainly, what's happening there is we're on our way to becoming the leader in Clinical. We started out with a broad vision to be the leader in Clinical many years ago, and that starts with putting in that anchor of eTMF, and we're really the leader there and still expanding there. And then CTMS, we got good success there. We're on our way to being the leader there. Then CDMS, we got our early customers live, very happy. Now we're planting these new seeds of digital trials, things like ePRO and Site Connect, eConsent.\n So our Clinical Suite is getting very broad, and we're the only vendor -- only technology company that's trying to attack it broadly and also reinvent it at the same time. So momentum is very good, and it's a long-term play. We're super happy with Clinical. I saw our first demo of one of our new applications about 2 weeks ago, our ePRO, the ones that the patients are directly going to use. And I think it's going to be the world-beating application, but it's new and it will change things. It will change the industry, so it takes time to adopt. Yes. Very good. Yes. When I compared to Vault is our Data business overall, which has multiple components, it has Link in there, it has Data Cloud in there, it has OpenData in there, and what we're finding there, we're making multiple data products and we're finding a way to fit them together in a nice cohesive data architecture that customers can start consuming in different areas. And that's very similar to Vault, nice architecture in the way of doing things. And yes, some people might start in Regulatory or they might start in Clinical or they might start in Quality. But then they all fit together and get more valuable as you have more parts.\n So that's what I mean about -- that's the hallmark of Veeva. We make excellent solutions that stand on their own, multiple different points of entry, and then we move forward. So -- and in terms of the specific use cases, I think it is good to dive into how Data Cloud is a bit different. Paul, do you want to take that one and maybe what some of our early adopters are doing with Data Cloud? Yes. Ken, this is Peter. I'm really happy with that 34% growth on what is becoming a larger number these days. So it's just the way that the deals are falling out and the product suite is getting larger. CDMS is very early in its revenue curve, CDMS, and then Digital Trials hasn't even really started. So I think that's what you're seeing, numbers getting larger. CDMS is really getting a lot of traction, but not contributing very much from a revenue point of view because these are large deals oftentimes that ramp.\n Now if you want leading indicators on Clinical, if you look in that script, one of the most meaningful lines in there was that 1 of the top 6 CROs switched to Veeva as their preferred CDMS. When a sponsor asks them to run a trial, that's a big deal. That will start a trend. So that's really good validation. So yes, really happy with our Clinical business. Yes, Dylan. I guess the way to think about that adoption is what drives the adoption. I would say, product excellence, number one, having the best product in the market and staying with it, building the best product in the market, that's hard work. We got to hire the best product people and have quite a strong vision. And so that's going well, and then we're very good at that. I would say the other thing is relationships. When you're bringing something into large enterprises, relationships really help. That's where our multiproduct approach really helps.\n And these products, we have a lot of early products. If you look at -- they're making progress, but they're very early in their revenue cycle, Safety, very, very early; Data Cloud, extremely early; even CDMS, very early. Not to mention some of the Digital Trials things, some other products we have. So progress really starts a long way before the revenue. So I'm really happy with the progress, and it will lead to good revenue over time. Yes, the business there, I think you're right, COVID headwinds has largely normalized in that business outside of life sciences. So there, we're focused on large customers in consumer products and chemicals, so things like your basic consumer goods, actually food,  consumer health care, cosmetics and specialty chemicals. And we're focused on company -- large companies largely, companies of $5 billion in revenue and above.\n And if you look where we're focused, Regulatory and Quality and Safety, that's kind of where we're going to help them -- Safety has a different meaning than inside life sciences. It's not the drug safety. It's safety of employees, safety -- and safety of environment. So pretty focused there, and I think seems got good momentum and steady as she goes there. It's going to be a nice, steady, growing business for us. Yes. MedTech CRM, we announced that last quarter. So overall, the MedTech business for us is going well, and it's largely on the Vault side, on the R&D side. It's the Quality, Regulatory, Clinical area, Commercial content. But we did announce MedTech CRM, and that was done very openly with Salesforce, who's been a great partner of ours for 15 years.\n 15-year partnerships in technology, that doesn't happen very often. So yes, we partner there in pharma with Salesforce. It's just early in MedTech CRM that we're doing on Vault, and we're just talking to some customers who may become early adopters. We're building the product. So we don't really have any progress to report. We're having a lot of good customer conversations. We're very happy with the RTSM acquisition. I'll take a little bit of time on that. It's feeling great, I have to say. I'm a bit more involved in that one than I am in some other things. And it's a small team and -- but they had a very robust product that they've developed over more than 10 years. But they didn't have a channel and a way really to sell that product.\n So that team is feeling really energized as part of Veeva. We've added to the team. We have a new general manager for that area that came from the Veeva side. He is engaged because he has a new job and a new thing to do. And we actually won a few new deals and net new logos. It's really feeling good.\n Now in terms of acquisition strategy, still, we would -- whenever we look to go into a new market, we would look, is that the right type of thing we can buy? Or do we build or do we partner? Oftentimes, you're not going to find the right thing to buy, sometimes you are. And in this case, we did. And so our strategy really hasn't changed, and we're very happy with our RTSM acquisition. Yes. Certainly, Quality is a big area for us and still relatively early, and it's growing in 2 ways. The footprint is getting bigger. So training was something we added, and that's now starting to do well. We bought what's called the GXP content. That's very early. That's starting to ramp. We announced a big new product, laboratory information management system, which is the way pharmaceutical companies test the quality of their products. That's a very strategic and big area. So it's growing in its number of applications.\n And then the places where we're bringing it is also growing. So Quality is one of those things -- over time, we'll probably have 1,000 Quality customers or more. We have roughly 450 or so now. So Quality will go far and wide and be a really big business for us over time. So you're right to pick up on that. Stephanie, yes, I think that trend of outsourcing in-source, that's largely net-neutral to us at Veeva. I don't see a big change in that, any kind of a macro change. It's really net-neutral. Now if we look at those small biotechs, what are the first things they need, they will need a Quality product and that they always have to have their own Quality records. That's just basic. So I see no change there.\n And then the next thing they will need is probably the Clinical area, and that is where, especially for the small biotech, Veeva making progress in the CRO channel, the contract research organization channel, becoming the preferred provider of the Clinical Data Management, that's what -- that is what's going to help us there. Yes, Brad. This is Peter. I'll take that. I would say it's a bit of both, right, the industry overall. I think you're talking about a pharmaceutical company, whether it's Pfizer or Novartis or Veeva, and so the industry is growing. And so we need more talent and kind of specialized talent, and so we're having trouble getting enough people and manufacturing those people. So it's a slowdown, is both, from both of those things.\n Now in the grand scheme of things, you have to remember, a pretty minor slowdown and no change to the competitive environment. On our side, yes, those types of people that you would expect, sales and services people. But the good news is we had a strong hiring quarter, and we're training a lot of new people about the industry. So we think we'll come out of this very strong. Yes. I would say I'm very optimistic about that segment. We really won't talk about -- we mentioned the CRO that picked Veeva as their primary CDMS, now that was a really big one. A CTMS win in the top 20 as well. But the pipeline is really progressing for Clinical, both in CDMS, CTMS, some combo deals across CTMS and CDMS. I'm very excited about that. Momentum, and you can feel it when it happens, it doesn't show up in the financials for a while. And we can definitely feel the Clinical momentum right now. All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. And thank you to our customers for your continued partnership and to the Veeva team for your outstanding work in the quarter and the year. Thank you."

            "name": "Paul Shawah",
            "content": "Yes, sure. And this is an area where we're very clearly focused on kind of the early adopter phase of the market, maturing the product, product excellence. I'll give you 1 or 2 customer examples because they're real and they're super interesting. One is a top 10 pharma company in one of their brand teams for a very specific use case. This is a specialty product. And specialty products are delivered through specialty pharmacies, and some specialty pharmacies block the access to the sales of that data. So which means the brand team can't see how much of it is being sold through that specialty pharmacy, it's this thing called block.\n So that's like having a blind spot. They can't see what's happening. And they came to us and they asked us if we could help fill that blind spot in for them, if we can provide that visibility. And we're actually -- because we -- because of what Peter talked about, the modern way that we source and assemble and bring all our data together, we essentially, in a sense, unblocked a lot of the things that they couldn't see with their legacy provider.\n So this is just one use case in a top 10 pharma company, 1 brand. This company probably markets 25 or 30 products. So when you think about that, that's patient data in a very small part of that company. And what happens is that, that starts to go viral in that company. So we're just building confidence in the data set, and the market is starting to see that.\n One other interesting example. It happens to be with one of the top vaccine manufacturers, is they were asking us about our vaccine visibility. And we used Data Cloud, our patient data, to look at the vaccine trends. And we found the trend and they said, \"Hey, wait. That's wrong.\" It was a very specific trend. There was a very specific dip at the time in the marketplace. And they questioned our data. And together, we dug into it with them and they actually learned something that they didn't expect, that they were surprised to learn. And they validated that our data was accurate.\n So we're teaching customers new things with our data, and we're building confidence in -- our product excellence is working. So that's playing out through the marketplace. It's going to take time. These are really complex companies, and it takes time for that to work through the system. But it's playing out really nicely in the early part of the market. Yes. Richard, this is Paul. I can give you an update. In terms of rep reductions, what we saw in Q4 was exactly -- pretty much exactly as we had expected and anticipated. We did see some reductions that we had planned for and anticipated. So no surprises there.\n We also didn't see anything that would cause us to change any of our thinking around this overall 10%, which has been playing out starting last year. It will play out mostly through this year and partly into next year. So really no change on any of that thinking. It's playing out much as we expected. Yes. Hey, Ryan. This is Paul. I can take that. I track those numbers pretty closely with Engage. First, the renewals have been very strong into this year. And last year, into this year, utilization was really high. The utilization will go up and down with offices opening and closing. And just preferences, we're focused together with the industry on helping the industry become more hybrid, operate either from the doctor's office or from their home office, and do that very seamlessly.\n I'm really proud of the team. We've built a really strong product in core CRM and Engage to enable this hybrid way of working. And that hybrid way of working is here to stay. Most every company, every customer that I talk to, they're thinking about hybrid ways of working, sometimes digital, sometimes in -- physically in an office. So although the utilization will go up and down, it's something that is just here to stay and it's going to be kind of how they do business going forward.\n So I think the renewals will continue in Engage. And particularly as we continue to innovate in that product, we're making it -- we're adding -- interestingly adding things into the product where even if you're in an office, Engage becomes valuable, where you can share content, let's say, 6 feet apart. That's part of the Engage platform. So our customers really appreciate that kind of innovation. So we're excited about helping to move the industry to hybrid and also the road map of innovation there. Yes. So when they -- first of all, what has driven some of their productivity gains is the adoption of more technology, the utilization of digital. And Veeva's played a big part in that. That was part of our strategy, help make the industry more productive.\n So now, they get the benefit of that productivity. And what they're able to do with that is, of course, take some of that as reductions. They're able to use that -- those dollars to either invest in more digital or to invest in other areas. Like as they do digital over the long term, they need better data as one example. So that could lead to tailwinds for areas like Link and helping them figure out who they need to reach digitally, Data Cloud becoming more precise about how they do digital engagement.\n So this is something that's going to play out over many, many years, the shift to digital. It's not a fast thing that happens. But I think the number of reps will hit a new steady state, and then the industry will continue to evolve and adopt new digital capabilities and also new data and analytics sets from Veeva and more broadly. Yes, that's a good insightful one. And you're absolutely right. We do see those nuances and differences across therapeutic areas. And we can see that at a pretty granular level. So we can compare oncology with neurology, with cardiovascular space. We can look at different segments. And we see differences there. And those differences are often related to some of the things that you just described. Their level of comfort with doing telemedicine is one indicator. If they're -- if they tend to do that more as part of their traditional practice, they tend to be more comfortable doing an Engage meeting with a pharma.\n So we translate -- there is some translation there. There's some other factors that come into play, the regional nature where some of these customers are. Some customers are getting reached now digitally, that weren't previously reached before in-person. So there -- some companies are expanding their customer target sets that they're able to reach.\n So we see those nuances. We help our customers get visibility into that so they can be more effective. They can start to benchmark themselves. And that's where our Business Consulting comes into play. We're able to be that very strategic partner to our customer, giving them kind of really precise guidance. So yes, it's a key trend we see and watch and help our customers think through. Yes. That's a good one, Brian. And the answer is yes, we are. And a couple of things are driving that. So we're seeing expansion within some existing customers. They're expanding their use to additional users and in some cases, even additional markets as they need to become more efficient in the content space. So expansions with existing customers, but we're also seeing because of digital, the demand for digital content. And once you become more digital, the speed of content, you need to be faster.\n So we're helping our customers get to new levels of speed with innovation areas like modular content, for example. So there -- our customers are innovating, we're innovating with them and helping them become more efficient. So expansions in existing customers, driving the new levels of efficiency with things like modular content is in -- because of digital, all is driving some of the uptick that you're seeing."

        "content": "Ato Garrett: Good afternoon and welcome to Veeva's Fiscal 2022 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call for the quarter ended October 31, 2021. As a reminder, we posted prepared remarks on Veeva's Investor Relations website just after 1:00 p.m. Pacific today. We hope you've had a chance to read them before the call. Today's call will be used primarily for Q&A. With me today for Q&A are Peter Gassner, our Chief Executive Officer; Paul Shawah, EVP Commercial Strategy; and Brent Bowman, our Chief Financial Officer. During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding trends, our strategies and the anticipated performance of the business. These forward-looking statements will be based on our current views and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the risks listed in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our most recent filing on Form 10-Q. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today December 1, 2021 based on the facts available to us today. If this call is replayed or viewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Veeva disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We may discuss our guidance on today\u2019s call, but we will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in the public form. On the call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today's earnings release and in the supplemental investor presentation, both of which are available on our website. With that, thank you for joining us. And I'll turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you, Ato, and welcome to the call, everyone. It was another great quarter for Veeva with strength across the business and results above our guidance. Total revenue was up 26% to $476 million. Subscription revenue was also up 26% to $381 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $199 million or 42% of total revenue. As noted in my prepared remarks, we had a very good quarter in commercial with particular strength in core CRM, Crossix analytics, and Veeva Link. In the R&D area, we saw continued strength across the board in Veeva Development Cloud. We will now open the call up for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Stan Zlotsky with Morgan Stanley.\nStan Zlotsky: Hey, guys. Good afternoon and thank you so much for taking our questions. Maybe just starting high-level, in the quarter, what did you see as far as the -- any shift in buying patterns? And I know you call that on the prepared remarks that I think an incremental $2 million headwind to billings in the quarter. Is there anything more to call out one-time that happened in the quarter?\nBrent Bowman: Oh, hey, Stan, it's Brent. No, in the quarter we're very pleased overall with the broad base strength we saw in the business. The one anomaly that I called out was we expected about a $14 million of one-time items to billings that came in at 16. But other than that, nothing else. I'm happy with the overall momentum and strength of the business.\nStan Zlotsky: Got it. Got it. And then as far as the way we should be thinking about guidance for Q4, any other shifts to note other than I think you mentioned the incremental $10 million of the essential shifts from renewables that we're going to be pulling pushing out into Q1 versus Q4. Anything else that we need to be mindful of as far as that quarter, any kind of underlying demand trends or anything else?\nBrent Bowman: Yes, so in addition to the item the $2 million you called out, so again, we're very pleased with the broad base strength. A couple of items, just to be mindful of is that the ACV, booking linearity was a benefit towards the first half and the second half. If you remember, we had our strongest two booking quarters in Q4 '21 and Q1 '22. So that has an impact. In addition, the CRM attrition is starting to flow through, as we expect, and that does have an impact on revenue as well. So those are the things that be mindful of. But all in all, we've never been happier with our competitive positioning and how we look at the opportunity ahead.\nStan Zlotsky: Got it. Thank you so much, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Dylan Becker with William Blair.\nDylan Becker: Hey, guys, nice job in the quarter and appreciate you taking the questions here. I guess maybe starting with Paul on the commercial side. So nice to see some additional wins with early adopters on Data Cloud, but I wanted to maybe dig in into the value with some of the releases coming up here next year with prescriber and sales data to really kind of tighten that feedback loop for these pharmaceutical companies. And I guess maybe just kind of that seems like a key driver of value here. But we'd love to kind of understand how you guys are thinking about this opportunity for those three components and data sets to really come together in Data Cloud as we think about 2022 and beyond.\nPaul Shawah: Yes, thanks so much for the question. Yes, so you're right. Overall, with Data Cloud, we're really excited about the potential that we have really significant market, big market where we have patient data, which is available today in the U.S market. And as you referenced, we're going to have prescriber data in Q1 of next year and sales data in Q2 of next year. So, we're excited to expand that portfolio. When we do that, what that allows us to do is to be -- we could be that sole provider for life sciences company for the vast majority of their data. And that's where we're approaching. Today, we have patient data, which is highly differentiated, we have a number of early customers who are proving out the value proposition of patient day of Veeva's patient data in the market. They're finding more patients, they\u2019re finding more targets. Data is more robust in many cases, and what exists in the marketplace. So, our hypothesis has always been we can create a better data set and we're proving that out in the market. So, we're super excited about where we're going with Data Cloud.\nDylan Becker: Okay, great. That's helpful. And then maybe one for Peter as well. So, we've seen a lot of kind of recent innovation across the quality well, and I think you kind of highlighted it on the Analyst Day about a month ago around that kind of broader opportunity set. So, I guess maybe the potential to kind of dig into that applicability here expanding again outside of potentially life sciences verticals, maybe something again, that shakes out more around that kind of 2025 timeframe. But thinking of how you guys are viewing kind of the innovation cadence in quality and the long-term opportunity of that suite in itself.\nPeter Gassner: Yes, quality we're very excited about is turning out to be a very broad business for us. So we added product surveillance, actually, that was a year or so ago, that's specific to MedTech, now adding validation and QC limbs for automating the quality control laboratory. So, it's pretty, pretty broad. And it has some products that are quite mature and doing well in the market, quality docs and even QMS now we've had for a long time. And then QC limbs, which is also a really big new product and we're just building that one. So, it has a combination of products that are mature and products that are just brand new. And that's targeted at life sciences, but quality is one of those products that goes outside a little bit, service providers to life sciences, its contract manufacturers, et cetera, CROs. So, lots of people need our quality suite. It can be a big business for us, that's for sure.\nDylan Becker: Great. Thank you guys for taking the question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Wong with Guggenheim Securities.\nKen Wong: Great. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of CRM questions for me. The first one, I think I found the script that you guys mentioned, maybe introducing a MedTech CRM. Is this a greenfield opportunity for you guys? Or is this just mildly additive by providing existing customers with a new experience? What's the right way to think about that particular product?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, Ken, it is a -- it's a new opportunity for us. Today we sell Veeva CRM for pharma into the pharma and biotech industry. And that's built on Salesforce.com, the Salesforce platform and that's going well, and none of that changes. So you can think of the pharma side as we're going to continue to execute as we have them. And what we announced differently was really for the MedTech space. So think of MedTech as this could be anything from a company that sells on a heavy medical equipment all the way down to surgical gloves. So, it's a broad industry, and it's a bit of a different area for Veeva in CRM. We've been selling to MedTech for the past couple of years primarily are vault, R&D applications and we're doing really well. We have over 100 customers where we sell to R&D, that's the big opportunity and MedTech is really the R&D space. But what we're doing in CRM is we're creating an industry-specific application for MedTech. We're building an industry cloud for MedTech. So, it's a -- it is -- it's new and additive.\nKen Wong: Got it. Super helpful. And then I also couldn't help, but notice that there was a mention of a top 20 enterprise customer. I guess my understanding was you guys had pretty much locked up everyone except for Roche and I recall, Matt used to say it was a bounty on that last enterprise Domino. I guess, should we think that you can vote it out? Or is this just some derivative of another enterprise customer that from a regional perspective? What's the happenings there?\nPaul Shawah: Yes, this is one we're proud of. It's -- I won't give -- I won't comment on specific customers. But I will say that we do have all the top 20. Some, at least somewhere in the globe, at this point, all the major markets. So we're really proud of this win. This is one that -- these things take time, right? We've been executing, as you heard in Peters remarks we have been executed really well in CRM. We've had really strong market share gains this quarter. We added the enterprise top 20, which you just referenced, that's in the U.S market. We had some competitive wins and takeaways elsewhere in Latin America and expansions in Japan. So, we're executing on all cylinders in core CRM, and more broadly in commercial. Yes, so really happy with that progress.\nKen Wong: Got it. Fantastic, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Your next question is from Brian Peterson with Raymond James.\nBrian Peterson: Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to hit on the sales rep productions at some of your customers. I'm just curious versus where we were 90 days ago, how has that progressed? And how should we think about the impact of those reductions in fiscal year '23 versus fiscal year '22?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, I could give you an update. So just as a reminder, we talked about roughly a 10% reduction happening through the end of fiscal year '24 with most of it happening by the end of next year. With regards to this quarter in particular, it was relatively light. We saw very small rep reductions, we do anticipate we'll see more in Q4, and also most of it happening through the end of next year.\nBrian Peterson: Okay, got it. That's helpful. And maybe just kind of a derivative on that. It's interesting we're starting to hear about rep reductions, you could think about maybe a move to digital. And I'm curious when you're engaging with your customers on the commercial side call, like, are they talking about spending more technology and software with you. So, even though we're seeing this reduction, should we still think about spend levels overall going up? How do we kind of think about that, that dynamic?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, they're very much related, because the reason they're able to have the productivity gains is because they're becoming more digital. So, what what's happening across the industry and what happened largely over the last couple of years that we've been, we've been driving this shift to help our customers become more digital and more productive, more efficient. And now they have those productivity gains and they get to decide how they take advantage of those gains. Either they can reach deeper into the customer base, or they can take some as reductions, and it's not a science and it takes a little while, which is why you see it playing out over time. But yes, there's certainly a correlation as they consume more of our products, as they become more digital, there are the efficiency gains, which they get the benefit of.\nBrian Peterson: Thanks a lot.\nPeter Gassner: Sure.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Sterling Auty with J.P. Morgan.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Drew on for Sterling. I was wondering if you could speak to the pipeline of new add-on products, particularly within CRM or anywhere else that you're seeing add-on?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, I can talk to that. The add-ons continue to progress really well. Over the last 12 to 18 months, you saw some acute spikes with some very specific add-ons. I would say that the tip of the spear add-ons helping our customers get to digital and you saw that spike with engage. So we've moved much of the industry to some of the new -- newer add-ons like Engage. But we're seeing strength more broadly across that, because they're all taken together, all of those add-ons help our customers be more efficient. They help them become more digital, they help them generate data better and operate differently. So, yes, we're seeing strength not only in core CRM, but also in the add-ons more broadly.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Stephanie Davis with SVB Leerink.\nStephanie Davis: Hey, guy, congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. I just want to call that the prepared remarks had a bunch of SMB wins. So I was hoping you could talk to traction in that end market. How should we think about the relative go-forward opportunity in SMB, just given both broader contracts and the scales IPO activity that we've been seeing lately?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, the SMB space is, it's a really important market. I mean, this is where you have some of the most innovative, interesting companies, biotechs, often launching their first medicine and this could be something that's highly specialized oncology, rare disease. So we are able to -- in many cases, start very early in the development cycle with our Vault products, which is most often where we would start anything from clinical to regulatory, and anything else across the spectrum. And then as they get closer to launch, often promote them into our commercial product set. So, yes, we're having really good strength in that space.  Now, going forward, I anticipate we'll continue to have that strength, and those customers have the unique advantage of having a clean slate. So going with development cloud, going with commercial cloud becomes really obvious, and really a whole lot easier for them compared to what somebody that may have some legacy systems tied to them. So, yes, it's a big value proposition with those small customers, we are making great progress there.\nStephanie Davis: That touches on my follow-up. Are there then some products within your suite, they're much more likely to add-on or attach to earlier than some of your established relationships? And how can we think about that up in the near-term?\nPeter Gassner: There are and it depends on where they are in their lifecycle. So certainly earlier -- much earlier in the lifecycle, you would start with some of the products in Development Cloud, which is likely where they would start in quality, in clinical, advancing to areas like regulatory. And then as they become closer to commercial, they actually often start with their medical affairs teams, because that's the first part of the organization that can see it and start positioning in the marketplace. And then they expand to the commercial product area. So it's really we can help them along that entire spectrum.\nStephanie Davis: Super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ryan MacDonald with Needham.\nRyan MacDonald: Thanks for taking my questions. I guess my first one is really around the Crosssix wins in the omni-channel analytics. Just curious to see what sort of momentum you're seeing in that space in terms of purchase decisions. Obviously, as digital becomes more important of an investment channel with those rep reductions physically. Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: Yes, you're exactly right, which is driving a lot of the momentum. Crosssix it's really the very best product in the marketplace. So that has been -- we've been building and maturing that product for a very long time and it's doing well in the market. We expect to continue down that trajectory. We're also innovating in the Crosssix space. So if you remember, we did some really innovative things where we took some of the interesting data that comes out of CRM, and we enhance it in Crosssix, which is what our customers are looking for. They're looking to us for that kind of innovation. So it's going well. And you're right, the big driver is as our customers are doing more digital, there's more of a need to measure and understand what's working and what's not working. And that's why they turn the Crosssix. So we're excited about that. That'll continue to be a big contributor and grower for us over the next several years.\nRyan MacDonald: Great. And then maybe as a follow-up, I thought it was interesting in the prepared remarks around Data Cloud and sort of the discovery of new use cases or new types of data within your customers thus far. Just be curious to hear some examples of some of those new use cases. Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: Yes. So the -- we started with the patient data, that's what we have in the marketplace today, longitudinal patient data, and we're expanding to the other datasets that we talked -- that I mentioned earlier. And our customers are able to patient [indiscernible] is super valuable to a life sciences company, particularly for some of these newer, more specialized precision medicines, as they need to have really good and deep visibility in what\u2019s happening to that patient across the journey. How are they getting diagnosed, what are some of the indicators that that may mean they have a medicine that they'd be able to treat that patient for longer term. So it really helps you can think about that patient data to help identify where patients may be. You can think about it as helping them to think about what treatments they're on, and when they may transition them over to their -- to a medicine. You can also think about it as segmenting and targeting customers. So those are some really specific use cases that our early customers are all using and taking advantage of today. And they're seeing really good results with.\nRyan MacDonald: Great. Thanks for the color.\nPeter Gassner: Sure.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler.\nHannah Rudoff: Hi all. This is Hannah Rudoff on for Brent today. Thanks for taking my questions. First one is kind of a follow-up on the last question. I think in the past, you've talked about customers maybe being able to find around 10% more targets using your patient data than using a legacy competitor data. I guess where do you see that number going once you have all three data sets rolled out?\nPaul Shawah: Yes, that's a good question. It will depend on certainly the therapeutic area and where we're competing, who we're competing with, where you're comparing it to, we do believe, because we're taking a modern approach, we're using technology, we're able to find the data that others are not able to find, and we're able to match those datasets together and create something really robust. So that's why we've been able to find additional patients, additional health care professionals and targets because of that. Do I see it? It may range, right? It's going to range. In some cases, it may be higher, it may be not as much. But we're pleased that the customers are getting the value that we thought they would get out of Data Cloud and it's only going to go in the right direction as we continue to invest more heavily in data.\nHannah Rudoff: Great. And then how are you thinking about headcount going into next year?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, I'll take that. So, we're pleased with our journey towards 10,000 employees in 2025. We have a very aggressive targets, and we're focused on building the organization to drive customer success and innovation. So, we're leaning in to investing in our people.\nHannah Rudoff: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America.\nBrad Sills: Oh, great. Thanks, guys for taking the question here. Congratulations on a nice quarter. I wanted to ask about any deals this quarter in that top 50 segment for clinical CTMS, CDMS? How did that fare during the quarter? Thank you.\nPeter Gassner: Yes, I mean, we continue to -- clinical continues to go really well for us. CDMS, as you know, we continue to add customers. We had some [indiscernible] are doing more trials, we're doing more oncology trials also as we're going along, those are some more complex, you need to be a little bit more adaptive, which is why they're looking to something that's more flexible, like CDMS. So we continue to make progress every quarter, adding more trials, making progress in the enterprise also. And then with some of the more established products like ETMF, continues to perform well. And our customers are also expanding and looking at areas like CTMS. So clinical is really proud of where that's going. And then of course, customers believe in our vision for digital trials, and the clinical foundations are really important part of that.\nBrad Sills: Great to hear. And then also, if I may, just an update on the regulatory business that, that's the Vault that has been you'd launched earliest and seen a lot of traction over the years. How well penetrated is that installed base? In other words, what's the runway to cross-sell and upsell that into the base from here?\nPaul Shawah: Yes, you're right. It was one of the earlier ones and it's still -- there's still a whole lot of runway left in regulatory. And also think about regulatory, it is a suite of products like the other areas. So we have submissions, and the ability to archive and publish submissions and registrations. So it's a number of products and you're really seeing two dynamics. One dynamic is where customers who may have started with submissions, registrations and they're expanding publishing. So we're seeing expansion from existing customers to buy additional apps. And then you're also seeing you saw on Peter scripted comments that we had our first enterprise kind of go all in with the regulatory suite. So those two dynamics are playing out, and certainly a lot of runway left there.\nBrad Sills: Great to hear. Thanks, Paul.\nPeter Gassner: And Brad, I would say a little more color in the second half of this year, end of Q2 and Q3 here. And frankly, the start of Q4, we've seen a lot of good momentum in the clinical data management. I think that's been, as I reflect a real pride spot. Now, particularly with large enterprises that doesn't turn into orders or close deals right away, because that's a risk averse area has long runway, but that's a real bright spot, our progress in CDMS in this so far, this calendar year.\nBrad Sills: Excellent. Thanks, Peter.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll now hand it over to the management for the closing remarks.\nPeter Gassner: All right. Thank you, everyone for joining today's call. I'd like to thank our customers for their continued partnership and the Veeva team for their commitment to customer success. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Oh, hey, Stan, it's Brent. No, in the quarter we're very pleased overall with the broad base strength we saw in the business. The one anomaly that I called out was we expected about a $14 million of one-time items to billings that came in at 16. But other than that, nothing else. I'm happy with the overall momentum and strength of the business. Yes, so in addition to the item the $2 million you called out, so again, we're very pleased with the broad base strength. A couple of items, just to be mindful of is that the ACV, booking linearity was a benefit towards the first half and the second half. If you remember, we had our strongest two booking quarters in Q4 '21 and Q1 '22. So that has an impact. In addition, the CRM attrition is starting to flow through, as we expect, and that does have an impact on revenue as well. So those are the things that be mindful of. But all in all, we've never been happier with our competitive positioning and how we look at the opportunity ahead."

            "name": "Peter Gassner",
            "content": "Thank you, Ato, and welcome to the call, everyone. It was another great quarter for Veeva with strength across the business and results above our guidance. Total revenue was up 26% to $476 million. Subscription revenue was also up 26% to $381 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $199 million or 42% of total revenue. As noted in my prepared remarks, we had a very good quarter in commercial with particular strength in core CRM, Crossix analytics, and Veeva Link. In the R&D area, we saw continued strength across the board in Veeva Development Cloud. We will now open the call up for your questions. Yes, quality we're very excited about is turning out to be a very broad business for us. So we added product surveillance, actually, that was a year or so ago, that's specific to MedTech, now adding validation and QC limbs for automating the quality control laboratory. So, it's pretty, pretty broad. And it has some products that are quite mature and doing well in the market, quality docs and even QMS now we've had for a long time. And then QC limbs, which is also a really big new product and we're just building that one. So, it has a combination of products that are mature and products that are just brand new. And that's targeted at life sciences, but quality is one of those products that goes outside a little bit, service providers to life sciences, its contract manufacturers, et cetera, CROs. So, lots of people need our quality suite. It can be a big business for us, that's for sure. Yes, Ken, it is a -- it's a new opportunity for us. Today we sell Veeva CRM for pharma into the pharma and biotech industry. And that's built on Salesforce.com, the Salesforce platform and that's going well, and none of that changes. So you can think of the pharma side as we're going to continue to execute as we have them. And what we announced differently was really for the MedTech space. So think of MedTech as this could be anything from a company that sells on a heavy medical equipment all the way down to surgical gloves. So, it's a broad industry, and it's a bit of a different area for Veeva in CRM. We've been selling to MedTech for the past couple of years primarily are vault, R&D applications and we're doing really well. We have over 100 customers where we sell to R&D, that's the big opportunity and MedTech is really the R&D space. But what we're doing in CRM is we're creating an industry-specific application for MedTech. We're building an industry cloud for MedTech. So, it's a -- it is -- it's new and additive. Yes, I could give you an update. So just as a reminder, we talked about roughly a 10% reduction happening through the end of fiscal year '24 with most of it happening by the end of next year. With regards to this quarter in particular, it was relatively light. We saw very small rep reductions, we do anticipate we'll see more in Q4, and also most of it happening through the end of next year. Yes, they're very much related, because the reason they're able to have the productivity gains is because they're becoming more digital. So, what what's happening across the industry and what happened largely over the last couple of years that we've been, we've been driving this shift to help our customers become more digital and more productive, more efficient. And now they have those productivity gains and they get to decide how they take advantage of those gains. Either they can reach deeper into the customer base, or they can take some as reductions, and it's not a science and it takes a little while, which is why you see it playing out over time. But yes, there's certainly a correlation as they consume more of our products, as they become more digital, there are the efficiency gains, which they get the benefit of. Sure. Yes, I can talk to that. The add-ons continue to progress really well. Over the last 12 to 18 months, you saw some acute spikes with some very specific add-ons. I would say that the tip of the spear add-ons helping our customers get to digital and you saw that spike with engage.

            "content": "Yes, thanks so much for the question. Yes, so you're right. Overall, with Data Cloud, we're really excited about the potential that we have really significant market, big market where we have patient data, which is available today in the U.S market. And as you referenced, we're going to have prescriber data in Q1 of next year and sales data in Q2 of next year. So, we're excited to expand that portfolio. When we do that, what that allows us to do is to be -- we could be that sole provider for life sciences company for the vast majority of their data. And that's where we're approaching. Today, we have patient data, which is highly differentiated, we have a number of early customers who are proving out the value proposition of patient day of Veeva's patient data in the market. They're finding more patients, they're finding more targets. Data is more robust in many cases, and what exists in the marketplace. So, our hypothesis has always been we can create a better data set and we're proving that out in the market. So, we're super excited about where we're going with Data Cloud. Yes, this is one we're proud of. It's -- I won't give -- I won't comment on specific customers. But I will say that we do have all the top 20. Some, at least somewhere in the globe, at this point, all the major markets. So we're really proud of this win. This is one that -- these things take time, right? We've been executing, as you heard in Peters remarks we have been executed really well in CRM. We've had really strong market share gains this quarter. We added the enterprise top 20, which you just referenced, that's in the U.S market. We had some competitive wins and takeaways elsewhere in Latin America and expansions in Japan. So, we're executing on all cylinders in core CRM, and more broadly in commercial. Yes, so really happy with that progress. Yes, that's a good question. It will depend on certainly the therapeutic area and where we're competing, who we're competing with, where you're comparing it to, we do believe, because we're taking a modern approach, we're using technology, we're able to find the data that others are not able to find, and we're able to match those datasets together and create something really robust.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\n I would now like to hand the conference to the speaker to give the forward-looking statements. Thank you. \nAto Garrett: Good afternoon, and welcome to Veeva's Fiscal 2022 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call for the quarter ended July 31, 2021. As a reminder, we posted prepared remarks on Veeva's Investor Relations website just after 1 p.m. Pacific today. We hope you've had a chance to read them before the call.\n Today's call will be used primarily for Q&A. With me today for Q&A are Peter Gassner, our Chief Executive Officer; Paul Shawah, EVP, Commercial Strategy; and Brent Bowman, our Chief Financial Officer.\n During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding trends, our strategies and the anticipated performance of the business. These forward-looking statements will be based on our current views and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the risks listed in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our most recent filing on Form 10-Q.\n Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today, September 1, 2021, based on the facts available to us today. If this call is replayed or viewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Veeva disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.\n On the call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today's earnings release and in the supplemental investor presentation, both of which are available on our website.\n With that, thank you for joining us. Now I'll turn the call over to Peter. \nPeter Gassner: Thank you, Ato, and welcome to the call, everyone. It was another great quarter for Veeva with strength across the business. Total revenue was up 29% to $456 million. Subscription revenue was also up 29% to $366 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $192 million or 42% of total revenue. As noted in my prepared remarks, we did well in our established areas but also had major progress in our newer areas, including safety, CDMS, digital trials, Link and Data Cloud.\n At this point, I'd like to open up the call to questions for Brent, Paul or myself. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we have Rishi Jaluria from RBC. \nRishi Jaluria: Nice to see some acceleration in the business. Wanted to -- Peter, in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about how there's some shrinking footprints and deployments at some of the -- on the CRM side. Can you maybe talk about how long you expect this headwind to last in terms of shrinking before it starts to stabilize? \n And alongside that, you talked a little bit about it, but Commercial Cloud growth still accelerated in the quarter, which is really nice to see, in spite of these headwinds. Can you maybe talk about what is driving that and maybe offsetting the shrinking footprints and particularly what you're most excited about within Commercial Cloud and what you think is kind of a sustainable growth rate for this business? And then I've got a follow-up on the CDMS side. \nPaul Shawah: Yes. I'll take that. Thanks, Rishi. This is Paul. Yes. So just to give you a little bit of color, if you remember back probably Q -- I think it was Q3 last year, we started talking about the idea that we were helping to make the industry more efficient. We were helping the industry move to digital. And as we did that in an accelerated fashion, they would realize the productivity and the efficiency gains of doing that, and there would likely be some reductions coinciding with that. \n We haven't seen them up until actually this quarter. So we started seeing some of the first reductions from a small number of our enterprise customers, had some reductions that were a little bit out of the ordinary. So we just started seeing it this quarter. I expect we'll continue to see it through the second half of this year and also into next year. We do expect that will offset those reductions as we have this quarter with strength really broadly across Commercial Cloud.\n We're going to continue to gain share in CRM. We gained share in CRM this quarter. I expect we'll continue to do that over time. And then we'll see strength in the add-ons and some of the newer products that you've heard Peter talking about, particularly in the data space like Link. Link had a particularly strong quarter, and that's progressing really well. Crossix will be a contributor. And then over the long term, we'll see more contribution from Data Cloud. So a lot to be excited about going forward. \nRishi Jaluria: All right. Wonderful. That's really helpful. And then on the CDMS side, maybe you want to expand and talk a little bit about your success in partnering with CROs because if we want the clock back a couple of years, there were definitely investor concerns that CROs were going to be a little bit of a headwind to Veeva over time, and it clearly hasn't turned out to be that way. And now you're talking about the traction you're seeing on CRO partner program and how that relates to CDMS. Can you talk a little bit about your strategy with CROs, particularly as it relates to the CDMS side, and how you've been able to gain that momentum with that as a channel? \nPeter Gassner: I'll take that one. This is Peter. Yes. CROs will be an especially important partner for CDMS because when that -- when CDMS becomes a part of their tech stack that they can offer to their customers, it's really an efficient channel. So how are we gaining traction there? I would say, number one, by actually product excellence, creating a better, truly cloud CDMS product that's integrated in with the other Veeva products. \n So as that has happened, the sponsors, they'll start asking the CDMS -- the CROs, sorry, they'll start asking the CROs about that, \"Hey, are you offering Veeva? Maybe you should be offering Veeva. We're using Veeva.\" And then the CROs, they start to get to know more about Veeva. And then they start offering Veeva as, first, experimentally as a product if a sponsor would want it. And then as they start to like it and see the efficiencies, then they start to make it their standard. \n So it's really about customer success for the CRO. It's about having an excellent product but also having a great partner program and providing them the support that they need. \nOperator: For our next question, we have Brian Peterson from Raymond James. \nBrian Peterson: So maybe just a follow-up on Rishi's question. But I'm just curious on the timing of some of the sales rep trends for some of your customers. Like how did that trend versus your expectation? And how pervasive is that? I guess I'm trying to think about where that impact is going to come in and how to think about what that could be in maybe fiscal year '23 and beyond. \nPaul Shawah: Yes. So in terms of timing, we talked about it as happening over 1 to 2 years. It's not an exact science, and we see a lot of our customers really thinking about -- the industry hasn't hit a new steady state. So if you remember, the industry was largely face-to-face, and now there was a massive shift to digital, and things are still in flux. A lot of things are changing with access to offices as the pandemic kind of continues and lingers on. \n So if you're a life sciences company, you don't want to overcorrect in one direction or the other too quickly. So that's why you're seeing a lot of this just takes some time for companies to be a little bit thoughtful about what's the right size of the field sales force. But in general, on average, we do see -- we are seeing our customers getting the benefit of becoming more digital. I think that trend is here to stay. That will happen over the long term. And I think they'll take these reductions over the next -- still over the next 1 to 2 years. So I think that time frame.\n And I think once we kind of hit a new steady state, I don't anticipate it changing much beyond that. So these are always reductions that we thought would happen as the industry became more efficient. We're just seeing them a little bit faster than we had anticipated. \nBrian Peterson: And Paul, what would be -- like if you're thinking about the total investments that they're going to make, right, you can think about the efficiencies they're going to gain maybe from attacking something with lower headcount, but there's a lot of opportunity to take some of those dollars and redeploy it. So what did some of the customers maybe learned? Or how are they thinking about attacking the opportunity with more of a digital motion? \nPaul Shawah: Yes, you're exactly right. It's the right way to think about it. So as we make -- let's say, as we're able to make an individual company, let's say, 10% or 15% or 20% more productive because they're able to mix more digital in, because they're able to accomplish more, they have the option, right? They have the option to reduce the size by that same amount or they have the option to take some of those gains and apply them just to reaching more customers. \n So that is the calculus and those are the kinds of discussions that we have with our customers all the time, our strategy teams, our business consulting teams, in terms of what's the right mix, the right mix of digital and field force engagement. And we're in active discussions with many of our customers on those kinds of things, and I think it'll be a mix for most customers. They will not take all of the productivity gains as reductions, though it'll be a bit a mix based on geography and therapeutic area and the specific needs of each business. \nOperator: For our next question, we have Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler. \nBrent Bracelin: I guess one for Peter and one for Brent, if I could. Peter, it seems that you really stood out this quarter, I think, with your first top 20 win. Do you think about that win as one of the early adopters? I mean it seems like safety is happening here maybe a little faster than I would have anticipated. And just wondering if that win with the first half '20 is just an early adopter. Or are you seeing a stronger interest and appetite to roll out that Safety Vault suite of products? And then again, one quick follow-up for Brent. \nPeter Gassner: It's -- we do have early adopters. We have a number of customers but smaller, and we have divisions of some large customers, but this was the first one to go all in with -- the first top 20 to go all in with us for safety. You never know when that's going to happen. The timing has to be right from a customer's perspective. They have to have a real need. To want to go early, they have to have a real need, and our product has to be ready, and the stars have to align.\n I thought it would happen sometime in the next -- sometime this year or early next year. And it happened -- so it happened a bit quicker than I thought, but not -- we would never take a deal like that before we're ready, right? We would turn down a deal like that if we weren't ready. So it happens just at the right time with just the right customer, and it is going to be a positive. But I don't see it as a -- I see it as a turning point for Veeva, but it's not going to be a turning point in revenue and adoption. That still happens on its normal life cycles.\n You'll really see the impact of this deal and the follow-through on this deal -- honestly, it's 2, 3 years down the road. That's when it really starts moving the market. You saw this with CDMS. This was maybe 1.5 years or so ago when we announced our first enterprise top 20 for CDMS. And now what you're seeing is the echoes of that follow-through in our broad CDMS adoption. \nBrent Bracelin: Super helpful color there. And then I guess, Brent, for you, referenced kind of a tight labor market. I think that's been referenced quite a bit. Just trying to think through the 5% salary increase. You have never really done this before. But as you think about that, is that tied to a proactive view to kind of stem churn? Was it reactive? Just trying to think about that 5% salary increase, particularly as it relates to -- I think Workday last week also was shifting some dollars out of stock-based comp to cash, and I just didn't know if there was a broader trend happening in the Bay Area or not. But could you talk a little bit about that 5% salary increase? And is that proactive, reactive? Just trying to understand the logic there and timing. \nBrent Bowman: Yes. I mean this is proactive. We're doing the right thing by our employee base, and we're in unusual times a bit with inflationary and in a very competitive environment. So we took a look at that, and we thought that the timing was right and -- to make this investment in our people. So it's effective as of today. \nPeter Gassner: And Brent, I would add, we're pretty international as a company. So we have a high percentage of -- almost half of our people outside the U.S. And inside the U.S., our concentration is not really in the Bay Area, right? We have development centers -- multiple development centers, Toronto, Boston, Raleigh, and a lot of our field people on the East Coast. So not having to do with the Bay Area per se. It was, as Brent mentioned, proactive and broad-based. \nOperator: For our next question, we have Ken Wong from Guggenheim Securities. \nHoi-Fung Wong: Maybe just a follow-up on that. So I think we -- you quantified the $10 million impact on EBIT for the year. Just wondering how we should think about any potential impact on maybe the services revenue. Should we generally just kind of bump up our services run rate that we're modeling? Any thoughts on that, Brent? And then I have a follow-up for Peter. \nBrent Bowman: Yes. I mean I just -- there's a nominal impact there on the services revenue from that perspective. I mean it's something that is normal course of business that we do flow that through on the services side, but nothing significant that I think warrants a change in your model. \nHoi-Fung Wong: Got it. Got it. And then I guess another kind of follow-on on that vein. I think I read in the script there, Peter, that you mentioned not raising prices for software or data at this time. And you guys have never raised prices in your history. Just wondering if that's something that you're contemplating with, as you mentioned, inflation, the salary bump. Is that something that might be in consideration down the line? \nPeter Gassner: That's a good question. Our philosophy has always been get the right price for our product and try not to increase the prices of our subscriptions. We haven't increased them because customers generally don't like it, and we try to get efficient and deliver more value. And we like to maintain doing that, and we think we can. Could we do that forever? That depends on how many years out in the future and what inflation does. But certainly, for the foreseeable future, we don't anticipate raising our prices for our subscriptions. \nOperator: For our next question, we have Stephanie Davis from SVB. \nStephanie Davis Demko: Congrats on the quarter. I was hoping you could give us some broader directional views on your digital trial suite, especially in light of the Delta variant. Could the macro backdrop result in a faster pace of adoption? And does that impact your investment speed or priorities in light of that? \nPeter Gassner: Okay. Thanks, Stephanie. I'll take that. So digital trials is really about all types of trials and not really related to COVID or the Delta variant. It's about making the trial faster and less expensive. So we have a target of 25% faster, 25% less expensive. And how we're going to do that is have it be really patient-centric and really paperless.\n So you might hear about something, the category called decentralized clinical trials. There's a lot of talk about that. That's an area where Veeva is into. But we're taking a broader, broader approach, overall digitizing the whole clinical trial starting from the sponsor side, the clinical data management, clinical operations to the clinical research side and then right out to the patient. So that's how we think about it, Stephanie, really broad and very long term. \nStephanie Davis Demko: And then I have to ask the flip side of the sales rep headcount reduction question. But you've been beating margins healthily despite this kind of move here over the past few quarters. What's been driving this outpaced margin expansion? And how sustainable is it? \nBrent Bowman: Stephanie, so regarding the margin, I mean, there's a few things that drove the outperformance. One is the top line subscription date is flowing through, and there is some lumpiness on the timing of our new data suppliers. We had one that we thought would close in Q2, and it actually closed in August. So that is some timing that played in, and that's factored into our guidance going forward. \n And then timing of hiring. We hired 236 net employees in the quarter, and we're slightly behind plan, and we're looking to catch up in the back half of the year as well. So -- but all kind of got contemplated into the beat in the quarter and then kind of how you think about the guide for the balance of the year. \nOperator: For our next question, we have Dylan Becker from William Blair. \nDylan Becker: I guess maybe first one from a higher level for Peter. You touched on it kind of in the prepared remarks. But thinking about again kind of your partnership approach with not only your business consulting segment but as well as kind of with the CROs, I guess love to understand how you guys are thinking of these as vectors to not only kind of drive that adoption of the existing platform but also kind of as drivers of your innovation efforts over time, right? You've talked a lot about kind of the strategic partnership approach, but would love to kind of understand how you're kind of viewing this to drive that innovation road map. \nPeter Gassner: Yes. It is an excellent question. I'll take the CROs first. We are partnering totally with the CROs to, yes, serve our customers, to leverage the CROs as a channel. But also, we can get very direct feedback with -- from the CROs. And we've done that, including the CROs more as part of our design process, have been talking directly to our product teams and just get that tight feedback loop going. We've put some great effort on that, and it's paying off.\n Now business consulting, that's a little bit different. These are our consultants, our billable consultants that are doing business process work with our customers. So there also, we have a tight feedback because as our customers on the business side are talking with our business process consultants about the process changes they would like to make or the change management they would like to do, that's sometimes translating into requirements into our product or ideas into our product. So I would say it's been a great addition to Veeva, this business consulting, and it is impacting our product road map for the better. \nDylan Becker: Fantastic. Excellent to hear. And then maybe one for Paul. And I think we've touched on this in the past, too, but we've talked about the payment integration kind of into CDMS, a nice kind of extension of the platform given that unified approach to the Clinical Suite. But I'd love to understand how you guys are thinking about that payment opportunity more broadly for the ability to expand use cases. And then what -- how have you guys seen that from an initial adoption perspective given that CTMS in its own right is kind of still relatively early of an offering to the platform? \nPeter Gassner: Yes. This is Peter. I'll take the payments one. Payments as it relates to our clinical operations, you're right that it's going well, but it's early because payments requires our CTMS product. CTMS is still relatively early in our life cycle. So the idea behind payments is to automate the payments to the clinical research sites based on the activities done. \n And that's where it's especially useful for the customer to get their clinical operations and their clinical data management from Veeva because the clinical data management, that creates the activity, and it gets passed over into the clinical operations and then the payment is sent out automatically. That's the value that the whole suite provides. So payments is going well, but still very early. \nOperator: For our next question, we have Karl Keirstead from UBS. \nKarl Keirstead: So Brent, Veeva beat this quarter on both revenue and billings. But relative to the last 3 or 4 quarters where you put up 4% to 6% beats on revs and 7% to 10% beats on billings, this quarter was a little skinnier. And I'm wondering what changed to create that result relative to your expectations. \nBrent Bowman: Yes. Karl, yes, so we did -- as you said, we did beat our guide. We're very pleased with the 29% year-on-year growth and Commercial Cloud at 22% and Vault at 37%. So we are very happy with how we executed. An area that I'd maybe call out is on the services side. We did talk about last quarter that we were running at a very high utilization rate and that we expected that to normalize a bit, and that definitely happened in the quarter. \n On top of that, what we saw was an increased amount of PTO, not only on the Veeva delivery side, but also our customers. So services came in within guide but on the lower end. But all in all, we're very happy with the demand picture that we saw for the quarter. \nKarl Keirstead: Great. And then if I could just ask you a margin question. So you indicated that the salary increase will occur over 5 months of this fiscal year. So if we annualize that, should we think about the impact on next year's margins, all else equal, being a roughly $25 million impact? And then I guess if we layer that into our models and assume a reversal, if you'd like, of the COVID savings you're experiencing this year, it feels like the more likely prospect is for margins to be down next year as a result of these 2 things. Is that at least directionally the correct approach, Brent? \nBrent Bowman: Yes. I'm not going to provide a guide on margins for next year, but what I can say is you're right in your rough sizing. It's about $2 million a month related to the 5% increase. And then time will tell on our travel and event savings that we see. Now we have up 200 basis points in our margin this year. Over time, some of that will come back into play, and time will tell. \nOperator: For the next question, we have Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. \nJackson Ader: This is Jackson Ader on for Sterling tonight. First question is on the strength in the SMB that you saw in the Commercial Cloud. How should we be thinking about kind of the direction here of strength in SMB versus the headwinds on the enterprise side for the rep count? Is there any worry that the strength in the SMB might feed its way into the same territory we're seeing in the enterprise? \nPaul Shawah: Yes. Jack, this is Paul. So yes, you're right. We have -- we're continuing to see really good strength in the SMB. And the new companies and SMEs tend to be commercial companies, companies that are launching their first medicine. And we're winning the vast majority of those. You heard us talk about this concept of Commercial Cloud accelerator where we're helping customers in a sense to go all in on a broad set of Veeva products and services, all upfront, all at once. \n So one thing we're seeing is the size of the deals with these customers, we're seeing kind of a longer-term emotional commitment and broader size and strength. And we're also seeing that we're consistently winning the vast majority of them. So SMB is driving a lot of strength, and it's driving also a lot of future opportunity as many of these companies will grow and expand into bigger companies over time. \n In terms of will they look like an enterprise in terms of rep reductions, some will and maybe for different reasons as kind of their market position and what happens with their medicine in the marketplace and whether they continue to have good traction in the market or not. But I think in general, the reductions that we have been seeing have largely been on the enterprise side because they're established sales forces. The SMB will scale over time to the right size, whereas an established company may have to do some adjustments as they become more productive. So I think it'll be different than the enterprise side. \nJackson Ader: Yes. Okay. That makes sense. And then a quick follow-up on the second CDMS deal with the top 20 pharma. Just any additional color you can give as to how this compares with the first. Is it a broader implementation, standardizing the trials on the Veeva platform? Any additional color would be great. \nPeter Gassner: Yes. On that second -- this is Peter on the second CDMS win. Different company than the first but similar needs and similar approach, similar rollout approach. They really need to modernize their environment. They had an environment that wasn't modern, and it was fractured with a lot of point solutions. And it just started slowing them down over time, and they realized why they need to really replumb the thing. \n So they piloted with a few studies to kind of both to test it out but to change their internal processes because when you move to Veeva for CDMS, it's an -- for example, it's an agile clinical study building environment. It's not a waterfall environment. It's an agile cloud-based environment. So there's a lot of change management to happen. But now they're starting to put all their studies on Veeva. So very similar to the previous one. \nOperator: For our next question, we have Donald Hooker from KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nDonald Hooker: So I just wanted to kind of follow up on the pharma sales reps pressures. I wanted to hear -- I didn't think I heard -- would love to hear, is this kind of a large pharma thing? Or kind of maybe a little bit more clarity where you're seeing the sales -- pharma sales rep pressure. And is there possible -- is there a possible explanation here that pharma is outsourcing more sales reps and sort of using third parties like Syneos and other CSOs as a shared service that could result in that pressure? \nPaul Shawah: Yes. It does tend to be a little more heavily weighted towards the larger -- the enterprise companies, again, companies that have established sales forces across diverse portfolios, many of them being larger sales forces where they establish for the more traditional primary care models. So think more traditional medicines where they have to reach large volumes of primary care physicians. They have larger sales forces. \n They tend to be the first place where they'll start to see some reductions because those field forces may have been sized for a different time in a different area where there was less digital. And now as we move into more digital, they have the opportunity to start to achieve some of those reductions. \n So I think primarily it will be in the enterprise. Again, you will see some rightsizing in smaller and midsized companies. So that -- the primary driver is kind of rightsizing and taking productivity and efficiency gains and being able to apply them so they have the right mix in terms of their go-to-market. \nPeter Gassner: And then in terms of the contract sales organization, I don't think we've seen a major trend there. Now that's going to vary a little bit region by region, but we haven't seen a major trend towards outsourcing at this time. \nDonald Hooker: Okay. And then maybe just as a follow-up, maybe kind of a higher level, kind of a little bit of a random question. But I would love to hear your perspective, if you have any, on sort of the commercial IRB space. I guess we saw a recent S-1 filing by a large, I guess, WCG clinical large IRB. And I know you have relationships in that area with some of the bigger ones and would love to hear your perspective as to whether this could be a growth vertical for Veeva going forward or how you sort of think about that space as a growth market either organically, inorganically or through partnership. So I haven't heard you talk about that in the past. \nPeter Gassner: Right. The IRBs, these are organizations -- they're centralized IRBs and localized IRBs to review the ethics of a clinical trial before the clinical trial starts. So that's a very important function. That's an area where we don't provide those types of services. And also, we don't provide software to those -- they need to have pre-specialized software. We don't -- that's an area where we don't play at this time. As to what we do going forward, we're always looking for places where we could add value. We don't have any specific concrete product plans in the IRB area at this time. \nOperator: For our next question, we have Brad Sills from BofA Securities. \nBradley Sills: Congratulations on a nice quarter here, certainly for Vault. And I wanted to ask about that a little bit. The RegulatoryOne business, sounds like you've had a couple of good deals there. Just could you provide a little bit of color on this top 5 CPG deal? Was this a new customer or was an existing customer adding another department? And then just more broadly, kind of where are we within CPG? That seems to be the industry where you've seen -- you saw early traction and you continue to see some good results there. Is it just an opportunity here to win more new business there? Or is it largely an expansion opportunity within some of these bigger accounts that you already have? \nPeter Gassner: Yes. I would say it's both. It's -- there are more large CPGs. There's a few that we aren't in. We're probably in some form or another, maybe almost half of them, the large ones, I guess, maybe at least 1/3 -- between 1/3 and 1/2 of the large ones. But then it's -- so there's some more to get brand-new logos, but then it's expansion because they're very divisional in how they operate. So the win we had, that was a regional division actually of a large CPG company. And they went with us because of the success that they had in another division. That's generally how it operates in CPG, very large, very distributed companies. \nBradley Sills: Thanks, Peter. One more, if I may, please, just on Quality and Regulatory. They continue to remain strong here. These have been -- a couple that have been very early drivers of growth with Vault. You've seen some real success there early on, and it continues to be an enduring driver. Where are we in terms of industry adoption of those offerings and just the categories in general? \nPeter Gassner: Yes. I would say we're early -- still early. We're early in Regulatory just because these are heavy systems to implement and to adopt. And then we're quite early in Quality because the suite has been expanding a lot in Quality. We started out with a product called QualityDocs, and we added QMS for a quality management system. Then we added training. We recently bought a company called Learnaboutgmp for actually training content, and we have more product plans underway in the Quality area. So Quality -- I think if you look -- you look out towards, for example, 2030, people will be surprised at how big our Quality business is. It still looks quite early. \nOperator: For the next question, we have Kirk Materne from Evercore. \nS. Kirk Materne: Paul, I was wondering, can you just give us a sense on these customers that took down sales reps? Had they already been talking to you about products like Engage? And I guess, meaning, are you helping them actually become more efficient from a rep perspective already? Or is that something that happens and then you go back in and help them sort of retroactively deal with it? And then I just have one follow-up on the commercial side as well. \nPaul Shawah: Yes. I mean all the ones that we saw reductions on, and it was a handful in the enterprise, they have all been Engage customers. And they all expand -- I think most of them were even early pre-pandemic where they started at some level of adoption of Engage. And then when the pandemic hit, they really scaled up. \n So yes, every one of them have been actively using, and I would say, even broader than Engage are the full kind of full suite of many of our digital products, including e-mail. So they were full on kind of face-to-face set up. They have these digital channels turn on. And again, they don't -- you don't want to overcorrect in this kind of market. It takes them a little bit of time to want to realize those gains but also to make sure they're optimizing for the long term. So yes, it was long-time customers of Engage and really taking some of those productivity gains. \nS. Kirk Materne: Okay. That's helpful. And then that relates to my second question, which is when you start thinking about the Commercial Cloud and all of the products and data that you're bringing to the -- for your clients, are you moving away from per seat pricing? Meaning, does at some point in time these discussions have to become more about outcomes versus just seats? \n And I was kind of curious where you see that going because, to a certain degree, if you're making them more efficient, they should be -- hopefully, they're growing with you on a net basis anyway. I'm sure they are in many cases. But I was just kind of curious if you're kind of getting away from having more per seat discussions versus kind of outcomes-based discussions and whatever kind of nomenclature that might mean from a pricing perspective. \nPaul Shawah: Yes. That's a good one. And certainly, as the Commercial Cloud portfolio has expanded, and particularly as we've added data products and data combined with software, also services, the proceed model doesn't necessarily fit those kinds of products. So we've already seen that shift happening over the last couple of years where more and more of our revenue is coming from things like ELAs. Most of our data products are enterprise license agreements with customers. \n So we're naturally seeing that shift away from proceed to something like an ELA. We haven't yet gotten to the idea of outcomes yet. And we're always very thoughtful of as we introduce a new product in the marketplace, what is the right pricing model, what's the right licensing model for Veeva but also, in particular, for our customers. We're happy to innovate in that area, and we have innovated in a number of places in commercial and how they consume, how they buy. So yes, that trend had already started happening. \nOperator: For the next question, we have Joe Vruwink from Baird. \nJoseph Vruwink: I wanted to go back to Vault Safety. And I'm curious, does the application and the criticality of carriers influence other spending decisions at a customer? I guess what I'm wondering is that once Vault Safety is established, is it perhaps more prone to being paired with, let's say, the rest of Development Cloud and MedComms for instance? \nPeter Gassner: Yes. It's a great question. It's certainly a very serious application because safety -- if a pharmaceutical company doesn't have the right controls in the safety area, they can actually lose their license to operate, the whole company. So it's a very serious one. When the customer has our safety system, I think it's a net positive and would somewhat help us getting other products because they would benefit from the integration with safety. And wow, if you're trusting Veeva for your safety system in the cloud, you're pretty likely to trust -- and you're having a good experience, you're pretty likely to trust us in these other areas. \n So it's an excellent question. If you step back, this is what we set out to do. Roughly 10 years ago, we started thinking about the Development Cloud. And this is what we had in mind, that we would have a suite of these applications for the drug development from safety, quality, clinical, regulatory and that they would all fit together and they would work for small companies and big companies and become the way that the life sciences industry does drug development. And so that -- it's happening. It's happening. And everyone we get in helps every other one. \nJoseph Vruwink: That's great. And then you referenced it a few questions ago. I know it was a small acquisition. But in learning management, I'm wondering, is training becoming a more important consideration? Would you kind of equate this to some of the developments like realizing business consulting could ultimately be an inroad to bigger things, a better relationship with your accounts? Is training proving to be that for maybe the Quality Suite or a broader set of applications? \nPeter Gassner: There are multiple types of training. This is true. For what we have here about Learnaboutgmp, that's for compliance-related training, good manufacturing processes. So that's really related to our QualityDocs product. And the way to think of that -- about that, it's sort of like peanut butter and jelly. Peanut butter is good, but if you get it with the jelly, you get -- it's easier because our QualityDocs is about the training software. \n Can it be accessible? Do you have the right roles and responsibilities? Is somebody overdue on their training? Can the inspector look at the records? Is it validated? Does it work in all your languages? All those types of things. But then by being able to come to Veeva and say, \"I actually need the training content. What in the clinical area -- for this type of certain area, what is the micro training that I can use to refresh my employees in Poland and Spanish-speaking countries,\" if you can get all that from Veeva with good customer service, that's what the customers are looking for, strategic partner, because they don't really want to focus on that and build that themselves if they don't have to because they have other things they want to focus on. \nOperator: And now for our last question, we have Ryan MacDonald from Needham & Company. \nRyan MacDonald: Congrats on the great quarter. I continue to be impressed by the number of new logos in core CRM, I think, 21 in the quarter, up quarter-over-quarter as well. Just love to know sort of beyond kind of the preclinical success that you're having, how the competitive environment looks in the mix of maybe competitive replacements in that number this quarter and how you sort of see that pipeline looking moving forward. \nPaul Shawah: Yes. That's a good question. And so of the 21, well, that's a little bit first. Many of them are from the U.S. market, those wins. And a lot of them are pre-commercial companies again both from Europe and then even the domestic companies in markets like Japan as an example, domestics that may have a local solution. So some of these are their first use for CRM system. And so we're not really replacing anything. And then others are competitive wins.\n We did have an OCE -- IQVIA OCE conversion this quarter. It was a biotech or a specialty pharmaceutical company in the U.S. market. There is -- there's more -- we are hearing more concern and frustration from a lot IQVIA customers. So we're -- and we're gaining traction. And -- but certainly, one was a direct conversion, but the vast majority are a lot of companies that didn't have anything in place already. \n Overall, the competitive landscape is shaping up really well, and that plays out in our numbers with the market share gains that we have in CRM, the wins that we're having that we talked about 21 of those. And we've been gaining traction with enterprise customers. So really happy with how the competitive landscape is shaping up. \nOperator: We don't have any further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call over to the management for closing remarks. \nAto Garrett: Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today, and thank you to our customers for their continued partnership and to the Veeva team for their outstanding work in the quarter. Thank you. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brent Bowman",
            "content": "Yes. I mean this is proactive. We're doing the right thing by our employee base, and we're in unusual times a bit with inflationary and in a very competitive environment. So we took a look at that, and we thought that the timing was right and -- to make this investment in our people. So it's effective as of today. Yes. I mean I just -- there's a nominal impact there on the services revenue from that perspective. I mean it's something that is normal course of business that we do flow that through on the services side, but nothing significant that I think warrants a change in your model. Stephanie, so regarding the margin, I mean, there's a few things that drove the outperformance. One is the top line subscription date is flowing through, and there is some lumpiness on the timing of our new data suppliers. We had one that we thought would close in Q2, and it actually closed in August. So that is some timing that played in, and that's factored into our guidance going forward. \n And then timing of hiring. We hired 236 net employees in the quarter, and we're slightly behind plan, and we're looking to catch up in the back half of the year as well. So -- but all kind of got contemplated into the beat in the quarter and then kind of how you think about the guide for the balance of the year. Yes. Karl, yes, so we did -- as you said, we did beat our guide. We're very pleased with the 29% year-on-year growth and Commercial Cloud at 22% and Vault at 37%. So we are very happy with how we executed. An area that I'd maybe call out is on the services side. We did talk about last quarter that we were running at a very high utilization rate and that we expected that to normalize a bit, and that definitely happened in the quarter. \n On top of that, what we saw was an increased amount of PTO, not only on the Veeva delivery side, but also our customers. So services came in within guide but on the lower end. But all in all, we're very happy with the demand picture that we saw for the quarter. Yes. I'm not going to provide a guide on margins for next year, but what I can say is you're right in your rough sizing. It's about $2 million a month related to the 5% increase. And then time will tell on our travel and event savings that we see. Now we have up 200 basis points in our margin this year. Over time, some of that will come back into play, and time will tell."

            "name": "Peter Gassner",
            "content": "Thank you, Ato, and welcome to the call, everyone. It was another great quarter for Veeva with strength across the business. Total revenue was up 29% to $456 million. Subscription revenue was also up 29% to $366 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $192 million or 42% of total revenue. As noted in my prepared remarks, we did well in our established areas but also had major progress in our newer areas, including safety, CDMS, digital trials, Link and Data Cloud.\n At this point, I'd like to open up the call to questions for Brent, Paul or myself. I'll take that one. This is Peter. Yes. CROs will be an especially important partner for CDMS because when that -- when CDMS becomes a part of their tech stack that they can offer to their customers, it's really an efficient channel. So how are we gaining traction there? I would say, number one, by actually product excellence, creating a better, truly cloud CDMS product that's integrated in with the other Veeva products. \n So as that has happened, the sponsors, they'll start asking the CDMS -- the CROs, sorry, they'll start asking the CROs about that, \"Hey, are you offering Veeva? Maybe you should be offering Veeva. We're using Veeva.\" And then the CROs, they start to get to know more about Veeva. And then they start offering Veeva as, first, experimentally as a product if a sponsor would want it. And then as they start to like it and see the efficiencies, then they start to make it their standard. \n So it's really about customer success for the CRO. It's about having an excellent product but also having a great partner program and providing them the support that they need. It's -- we do have early adopters. We have a number of customers but smaller, and we have divisions of some large customers, but this was the first one to go all in with -- the first top 20 to go all in with us for safety. You never know when that's going to happen. The timing has to be right from a customer's perspective. They have to have a real need. To want to go early, they have to have a real need, and our product has to be ready, and the stars have to align.\n I thought it would happen sometime in the next -- sometime this year or early next year. And it happened -- so it happened a bit quicker than I thought, but not -- we would never take a deal like that before we're ready, right? We would turn down a deal like that if we weren't ready. So it happens just at the right time with just the right customer, and it is going to be a positive. But I don't see it as a -- I see it as a turning point for Veeva, but it's not going to be a turning point in revenue and adoption. That still happens on its normal life cycles.\n You'll really see the impact of this deal and the follow-through on this deal -- honestly, it's 2, 3 years down the road. That's when it really starts moving the market. You saw this with CDMS. This was maybe 1.5 years or so ago when we announced our first enterprise top 20 for CDMS. And now what you're seeing is the echoes of that follow-through in our broad CDMS adoption. And Brent, I would add, we're pretty international as a company. So we have a high percentage of -- almost half of our people outside the U.S. And inside the U.S., our concentration is not really in the Bay Area, right? We have development centers -- multiple development centers, Toronto, Boston, Raleigh, and a lot of our field people on the East Coast. So not having to do with the Bay Area per se. It was, as Brent mentioned, proactive and broad-based. That's a good question. Our philosophy has always been get the right price for our product and try not to increase the prices of our subscriptions. We haven't increased them because customers generally don't like it, and we try to get efficient and deliver more value. And we like to maintain doing that, and we think we can. Could we do that forever? That depends on how many years out in the future and what inflation does. But certainly, for the foreseeable future, we don't anticipate raising our prices for our subscriptions. Okay. Thanks, Stephanie. I'll take that. So digital trials is really about all types of trials and not really related to COVID or the Delta variant. It's about making the trial faster and less expensive. So we have a target of 25% faster, 25% less expensive. And how we're going to do that is have it be really patient-centric and really paperless.\n So you might hear about something, the category called decentralized clinical trials. There's a lot of talk about that. That's an area where Veeva is into. But we're taking a broader, broader approach, overall digitizing the whole clinical trial starting from the sponsor side, the clinical data management, clinical operations to the clinical research side and then right out to the patient. So that's how we think about it, Stephanie, really broad and very long term. Yes. It is an excellent question. I'll take the CROs first. We are partnering totally with the CROs to, yes, serve our customers, to leverage the CROs as a channel. But also, we can get very direct feedback with -- from the CROs. And we've done that, including the CROs more as part of our design process, have been talking directly to our product teams and just get that tight feedback loop going. We've put some great effort on that, and it's paying off.\n Now business consulting, that's a little bit different. These are our consultants, our billable consultants that are doing business process work with our customers. So there also, we have a tight feedback because as our customers on the business side are talking with our business process consultants about the process changes they would like to make or the change management they would like to do, that's sometimes translating into requirements into our product or ideas into our product. So I would say it's been a great addition to Veeva, this business consulting, and it is impacting our product road map for the better. Yes. This is Peter. I'll take the payments one. Payments as it relates to our clinical operations, you're right that it's going well, but it's early because payments requires our CTMS product. CTMS is still relatively early in our life cycle. So the idea behind payments is to automate the payments to the clinical research sites based on the activities done. \n And that's where it's especially useful for the customer to get their clinical operations and their clinical data management from Veeva because the clinical data management, that creates the activity, and it gets passed over into the clinical operations and then the payment is sent out automatically. That's the value that the whole suite provides. So payments is going well, but still very early. Yes. On that second -- this is Peter on the second CDMS win. Different company than the first but similar needs and similar approach, similar rollout approach. They really need to modernize their environment. They had an environment that wasn't modern, and it was fractured with a lot of point solutions. And it just started slowing them down over time, and they realized why they need to really replumb the thing. \n So they piloted with a few studies to kind of both to test it out but to change their internal processes because when you move to Veeva for CDMS, it's an -- for example, it's an agile clinical study building environment. It's not a waterfall environment. It's an agile cloud-based environment. So there's a lot of change management to happen. But now they're starting to put all their studies on Veeva. So very similar to the previous one. And then in terms of the contract sales organization, I don't think we've seen a major trend there. Now that's going to vary a little bit region by region, but we haven't seen a major trend towards outsourcing at this time. Right. The IRBs, these are organizations -- they're centralized IRBs and localized IRBs to review the ethics of a clinical trial before the clinical trial starts. So that's a very important function. That's an area where we don't provide those types of services. And also, we don't provide software to those -- they need to have pre-specialized software. We don't -- that's an area where we don't play at this time. As to what we do going forward, we're always looking for places where we could add value. We don't have any specific concrete product plans in the IRB area at this time. Yes. I would say it's both. It's -- there are more large CPGs. There's a few that we aren't in. We're probably in some form or another, maybe almost half of them, the large ones, I guess, maybe at least 1/3 -- between 1/3 and 1/2 of the large ones. But then it's -- so there's some more to get brand-new logos, but then it's expansion because they're very divisional in how they operate. So the win we had, that was a regional division actually of a large CPG company. And they went with us because of the success that they had in another division. That's generally how it operates in CPG, very large, very distributed companies. Yes. I would say we're early -- still early. We're early in Regulatory just because these are heavy systems to implement and to adopt. And then we're quite early in Quality because the suite has been expanding a lot in Quality. We started out with a product called QualityDocs, and we added QMS for a quality management system. Then we added training. We recently bought a company called Learnaboutgmp for actually training content, and we have more product plans underway in the Quality area. So Quality -- I think if you look -- you look out towards, for example, 2030, people will be surprised at how big our Quality business is. It still looks quite early. Yes. It's a great question. It's certainly a very serious application because safety -- if a pharmaceutical company doesn't have the right controls in the safety area, they can actually lose their license to operate, the whole company. So it's a very serious one. When the customer has our safety system, I think it's a net positive and would somewhat help us getting other products because they would benefit from the integration with safety. And wow, if you're trusting Veeva for your safety system in the cloud, you're pretty likely to trust -- and you're having a good experience, you're pretty likely to trust us in these other areas. \n So it's an excellent question. If you step back, this is what we set out to do. Roughly 10 years ago, we started thinking about the Development Cloud. And this is what we had in mind, that we would have a suite of these applications for the drug development from safety, quality, clinical, regulatory and that they would all fit together and they would work for small companies and big companies and become the way that the life sciences industry does drug development. And so that -- it's happening. It's happening. And everyone we get in helps every other one. There are multiple types of training. This is true. For what we have here about Learnaboutgmp, that's for compliance-related training, good manufacturing processes. So that's really related to our QualityDocs product. And the way to think of that -- about that, it's sort of like peanut butter and jelly. Peanut butter is good, but if you get it with the jelly, you get -- it's easier because our QualityDocs is about the training software. \n Can it be accessible? Do you have the right roles and responsibilities? Is somebody overdue on their training? Can the inspector look at the records? Is it validated? Does it work in all your languages? All those types of things. But then by being able to come to Veeva and say, \"I actually need the training content. What in the clinical area -- for this type of certain area, what is the micro training that I can use to refresh my employees in Poland and Spanish-speaking countries,\" if you can get all that from Veeva with good customer service, that's what the customers are looking for, strategic partner, because they don't really want to focus on that and build that themselves if they don't have to because they have other things they want to focus on."

            "name": "Paul Shawah",
            "content": "Yes. I'll take that. Thanks, Rishi. This is Paul. Yes. So just to give you a little bit of color, if you remember back probably Q -- I think it was Q3 last year, we started talking about the idea that we were helping to make the industry more efficient. We were helping the industry move to digital. And as we did that in an accelerated fashion, they would realize the productivity and the efficiency gains of doing that, and there would likely be some reductions coinciding with that. \n We haven't seen them up until actually this quarter. So we started seeing some of the first reductions from a small number of our enterprise customers, had some reductions that were a little bit out of the ordinary. So we just started seeing it this quarter. I expect we'll continue to see it through the second half of this year and also into next year. We do expect that will offset those reductions as we have this quarter with strength really broadly across Commercial Cloud.\n We're going to continue to gain share in CRM. We gained share in CRM this quarter. I expect we'll continue to do that over time. And then we'll see strength in the add-ons and some of the newer products that you've heard Peter talking about, particularly in the data space like Link. Link had a particularly strong quarter, and that's progressing really well. Crossix will be a contributor. And then over the long term, we'll see more contribution from Data Cloud. So a lot to be excited about going forward. Yes. So in terms of timing, we talked about it as happening over 1 to 2 years. It's not an exact science, and we see a lot of our customers really thinking about -- the industry hasn't hit a new steady state. So if you remember, the industry was largely face-to-face, and now there was a massive shift to digital, and things are still in flux. A lot of things are changing with access to offices as the pandemic kind of continues and lingers on. \n So if you're a life sciences company, you don't want to overcorrect in one direction or the other too quickly. So that's why you're seeing a lot of this just takes some time for companies to be a little bit thoughtful about what's the right size of the field sales force. But in general, on average, we do see -- we are seeing our customers getting the benefit of becoming more digital. I think that trend is here to stay. That will happen over the long term. And I think they'll take these reductions over the next -- still over the next 1 to 2 years. So I think that time frame.\n And I think once we kind of hit a new steady state, I don't anticipate it changing much beyond that. So these are always reductions that we thought would happen as the industry became more efficient. We're just seeing them a little bit faster than we had anticipated. Yes, you're exactly right. It's the right way to think about it. So as we make -- let's say, as we're able to make an individual company, let's say, 10% or 15% or 20% more productive because they're able to mix more digital in, because they're able to accomplish more, they have the option, right? They have the option to reduce the size by that same amount or they have the option to take some of those gains and apply them just to reaching more customers. \n So that is the calculus and those are the kinds of discussions that we have with our customers all the time, our strategy teams, our business consulting teams, in terms of what's the right mix, the right mix of digital and field force engagement. And we're in active discussions with many of our customers on those kinds of things, and I think it'll be a mix for most customers. They will not take all of the productivity gains as reductions, though it'll be a bit a mix based on geography and therapeutic area and the specific needs of each business. Yes. Jack, this is Paul. So yes, you're right. We have -- we're continuing to see really good strength in the SMB. And the new companies and SMEs tend to be commercial companies, companies that are launching their first medicine. And we're winning the vast majority of those. You heard us talk about this concept of Commercial Cloud accelerator where we're helping customers in a sense to go all in on a broad set of Veeva products and services, all upfront, all at once. \n So one thing we're seeing is the size of the deals with these customers, we're seeing kind of a longer-term emotional commitment and broader size and strength. And we're also seeing that we're consistently winning the vast majority of them. So SMB is driving a lot of strength, and it's driving also a lot of future opportunity as many of these companies will grow and expand into bigger companies over time. \n In terms of will they look like an enterprise in terms of rep reductions, some will and maybe for different reasons as kind of their market position and what happens with their medicine in the marketplace and whether they continue to have good traction in the market or not. But I think in general, the reductions that we have been seeing have largely been on the enterprise side because they're established sales forces. The SMB will scale over time to the right size, whereas an established company may have to do some adjustments as they become more productive. So I think it'll be different than the enterprise side. Yes. It does tend to be a little more heavily weighted towards the larger -- the enterprise companies, again, companies that have established sales forces across diverse portfolios, many of them being larger sales forces where they establish for the more traditional primary care models. So think more traditional medicines where they have to reach large volumes of primary care physicians. They have larger sales forces. \n They tend to be the first place where they'll start to see some reductions because those field forces may have been sized for a different time in a different area where there was less digital. And now as we move into more digital, they have the opportunity to start to achieve some of those reductions. \n So I think primarily it will be in the enterprise. Again, you will see some rightsizing in smaller and midsized companies. So that -- the primary driver is kind of rightsizing and taking productivity and efficiency gains and being able to apply them so they have the right mix in terms of their go-to-market. Yes. I mean all the ones that we saw reductions on, and it was a handful in the enterprise, they have all been Engage customers. And they all expand -- I think most of them were even early pre-pandemic where they started at some level of adoption of Engage. And then when the pandemic hit, they really scaled up. \n So yes, every one of them have been actively using, and I would say, even broader than Engage are the full kind of full suite of many of our digital products, including e-mail. So they were full on kind of face-to-face set up. They have these digital channels turn on. And again, they don't -- you don't want to overcorrect in this kind of market. It takes them a little bit of time to want to realize those gains but also to make sure they're optimizing for the long term. So yes, it was long-time customers of Engage and really taking some of those productivity gains. Yes. That's a good one. And certainly, as the Commercial Cloud portfolio has expanded, and particularly as we've added data products and data combined with software, also services, the proceed model doesn't necessarily fit those kinds of products. So we've already seen that shift happening over the last couple of years where more and more of our revenue is coming from things like ELAs. Most of our data products are enterprise license agreements with customers. \n So we're naturally seeing that shift away from proceed to something like an ELA. We haven't yet gotten to the idea of outcomes yet. And we're always very thoughtful of as we introduce a new product in the marketplace, what is the right pricing model, what's the right licensing model for Veeva but also, in particular, for our customers. We're happy to innovate in that area, and we have innovated in a number of places in commercial and how they consume, how they buy. So yes, that trend had already started happening. Yes. That's a good question. And so of the 21, well, that's a little bit first. Many of them are from the U.S. market, those wins. And a lot of them are pre-commercial companies again both from Europe and then even the domestic companies in markets like Japan as an example, domestics that may have a local solution. So some of these are their first use for CRM system. And so we're not really replacing anything. And then others are competitive wins.\n We did have an OCE -- IQVIA OCE conversion this quarter. It was a biotech or a specialty pharmaceutical company in the U.S. market. There is -- there's more -- we are hearing more concern and frustration from a lot IQVIA customers. So we're -- and we're gaining traction. And -- but certainly, one was a direct conversion, but the vast majority are a lot of companies that didn't have anything in place already. \n Overall, the competitive landscape is shaping up really well, and that plays out in our numbers with the market share gains that we have in CRM, the wins that we're having that we talked about 21 of those. And we've been gaining traction with enterprise customers. So really happy with how the competitive landscape is shaping up."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ato Garrett, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAto Garrett: Good afternoon, and welcome to Veeva\u2019s fiscal 2022 first quarter earnings conference call for the quarter ended April 30, 2021. As a reminder, we posted prepared remarks on Veeva\u2019s Investor Relations website just after 1:00 p.m. Pacific today. We hope you\u2019ve had a chance to read them before the call. Today\u2019s call will be primarily used for Q&A. With me today for Q&A are Peter Gassner, our Chief Executive Officer; Brent Bowman, our Chief Financial Officer; and Paul Shawah, EVP, Strategy. During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding trends, our strategies and the anticipated performance of the business. These forward-looking statements will be based on our current views and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the risks listed in our earnings release and on the risk factors included in our most recent filing on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today, May 27, 2021, based on the facts available to us today. If this call is replayed or viewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Veeva disclaims any obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements. We may discuss our guidance on today\u2019s call but we will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter, unless we do so in a public forum. On the call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today\u2019s earnings release and in the supplemental investor presentation, both of which are available on our website. With that, thank you for joining us, and I will turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you, Ato, and welcome to the call, everyone. We had an outstanding Q1 with results well ahead of guidance due to significant outperformance in Development Cloud and continued strength in Commercial Cloud. Total revenue in the quarter was $434 million, up 29% year-over-year, with subscription revenue up 26% to $341 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $181 million or 42% of total revenue. You will find further details about the quarter in our prepared remarks posted on our website at 1 Pacific today. At this point, I would like to open up the call to questions for Brent, Paul or myself.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Brian Peterson with Raymond James.\nBrian Peterson: Congrats on the really strong results. So, obviously, we saw acceleration in the Vault services revenue. I know this has come up in the past. But Brent, how do I think about the Vault services as an indicator of what\u2019s going on in the broader business? Is that a future indicator or coincident? Just trying to help me frame that a little bit.\nBrent Bowman: Yes. Thanks, Brian. Yes. So, services in general is not a good leading indicator, I would say. One thing to keep in mind is just -- there\u2019s just a lot of variability in services revenue. And why is that? Different products have different service requirements and customers have different needs, based on their in-house capabilities. But what I will say, we\u2019re very pleased with the overall service business, the strength that we saw on the development side and broadly.\nBrian Peterson: Got it. Okay. And just maybe on the Quality strength, I know we heard that as that an area of last quarter. Peter or Paul, I don\u2019t know who wants to take that but just what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the Quality product and how that\u2019s really ramping up with customers? Thanks, guys.\nPaul Shawah: Yes. Thanks, Brian. This is Paul. Yes, we did have another strong quarter overall in Quality, really broadly across Development Cloud and in Quality in particular. And I guess, I\u2019d started at the highest level, the unified vision that we have in Development Cloud is working, and Quality is just a perfect example where we\u2019re bringing together documentation with quality management with training, and they\u2019re all progressing really, really well. Customers are buying into that overall vision, and then they\u2019re rolling out and kind of driving that vision over time. So, we had really strong performance in QualityDocs and really in all of the areas. And companies are looking to modernize in the Quality space, and they\u2019re looking at Veeva to be that partner to help them there. So, we\u2019re really pleased with our progress.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nDonald Hooker: Just like to hear maybe a little bit more, if you would all share with us some of your thoughts around the pharma sales force globally. It seems like from the prepared comments, you\u2019re walking back some of your concerns or maybe pushing them out. Can you just maybe expand on your thinking there?\nPaul Shawah: Yes, sure. I can give you some color on that. This is something we watch and keep an eye on very closely. There\u2019s always some variability up and down every quarter. But, we haven\u2019t seen any of the reductions so far that we\u2019ve talked about, I guess, two quarters ago now. But, having said that, I guess, maybe the context and the color behind that, these are significant changes. The industry hasn\u2019t yet hit a new steady state and stabilized yet in terms of what the field structure is going to look like. So, these are big changes for pharma companies, which is why I think it will take a little bit longer. And I think we\u2019ll start to see that impact closer to the second half of this year and then likely through the end of next year. So, I wouldn\u2019t classify it as a walking back. I classify it more as just happening a little bit more over time.\nDonald Hooker: Okay. And then, I guess, in recent quarters, there\u2019s been a lot of buzz around decentralized clinical trials across the CRO space and pharma in general. Is that -- does that require for you guys any incremental investment? Is there something else you would need? There\u2019s a whole bunch of these decentralized clinical trial companies coming to market. I\u2019m just wondering for you all if there\u2019s -- is that a new -- maybe new product area, or is that sort of what you already have? Is there something else you need there?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, decentralized trials, that\u2019s part of what we call digital trials, so that\u2019s moving clinical trials to paperless and patient-centric. Decentralized trials itself refers to, most often, to being able to do parts of the trial process with the patient in the patient\u2019s home, still supervised by a caregiver, but that may be through an in-home nurse, or that may be through a Zoom call, something like that. So, we do have significant technology investment in that area and that will be ongoing. That\u2019s things like MyVeeva for patients, for example. That will fit into decentralized clinical trials. What we\u2019re doing for eConsent, our Site Connect product. And then, we\u2019ll connect that into our Clinical Suite for the sponsor. So, it\u2019s a big opportunity and area of investment. But for us, it could be a bit broader. It\u2019s what we call digital trials.\nDonald Hooker: Okay. And maybe I\u2019ll just throw one last one in and just kind of one from left field for me. I guess, have you all ever thought about or is there any kind of thought about expanding sort of into more preclinical functionality? Is there any opportunity there? I guess, maybe the argument being with all these more advanced biotherapeutics and cell and gene therapies, is there a greater need to link together workflows perhaps across clinical and preclinical and discovery and all that? Is there sort of an expansion opportunity there for you at some point over time?\nPeter Gassner: Well, I\u2019ll play -- this is Peter and I\u2019ll play left fielder today and I got that one out of left field. So, we broadly -- you can characterize that as a preclinical. Some people would also characterize that as the research area of pharmaceutical. That\u2019s not an area where we\u2019re focused at this time when you keep an eye on it, and you never say never in the future. But that\u2019s not -- there\u2019s no ongoing investment or product from Veeva at this time. I would say it\u2019s lightly connected. That would be an area that would be lightly connected to the rest of our products, and we have no plans at this time. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Ken Wong with Guggenheim Partners.\nKen Wong: Sorry about that, new button. This is an extension of the last question to some degree. Peter, when we talk to our contacts in the life science industry, a theme that keeps popping up is kind of this past year led to a potential reimagining of clinical workflows, from trials to submission to post production, which could potentially lead to a replatforming for many customers. I guess, how much truth is there in that particular statement, do you think? And then just given your end-to-end stack, is it fair to assume that Veeva would be a potential beneficiary of such a replatforming?\nPeter Gassner: Ken, that\u2019s fair to think that the customers are definitely reimagining things COVID, and across all industries has caused people to think maybe some assumptions that they had in the past were not valid. And so, now, they\u2019re trying to question everything more open to innovation, I think, tremendous downside of COVID in terms of loss of life, increasing mobility, that type of thing. But, it is spurring innovation. Adversity creates innovation. So, that is what\u2019s going on. So, there\u2019s questioning. When we look at replatforming, I think really, what I see from the customers is, yes, reimagining efficiency, digital data investment. And yes, I think we\u2019re getting a slight tailwind from that. Again though, we have a long cycle with our customers. So, it\u2019s not something that you\u2019re going to immediately see but that will be a continued and moderate tailwind for us for the next three, four years, really. And it\u2019s a positive trend when customers look to innovation, because our product footprint is well positioned. We did a lot of things as we moved into digital last year, especially with MyVeeva and the digital trials and Veeva Engage that position us well. So, I think we\u2019re in a good position and a favorable position, Ken.\nKen Wong: Got it. Very helpful, Peter. Thanks for the insight. And then, a quick one for you, Paul. Just wondering on Data Cloud, you guys talked out seeing more customer interest there. Any sense if there\u2019s a good amount of pent-up demand for when you guys finally roll out the rest of the prescription data and kind of across U.S. and, to the extent, international at some point?\nPaul Shawah: Yes. So, we\u2019re certainly focused on the U.S. market at this point. And as you know, our first product in Data Cloud is patient data. We will, as you mentioned, have prescriber and sales data over time. So, the focus right now is patient data. It\u2019s on building the best patient data product and longitudinal patient data and it\u2019s working in the early market. So, we\u2019re really proud of the success and the value that we\u2019re creating for customers in the early market. In terms of pent-up demand, this is a long journey. We\u2019re investing for the long term here. We\u2019re excited about the innovation, and our customers are excited about the innovation we can deliver. But they recognize that this is really a long-term play. So, really for the long haul, and we\u2019re excited about the progress we\u2019ve made so far.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Bhavan Suri with William Blair.\nDylan Becker: Great. Thanks, guys. This is Dylan Becker actually on for Bhavan tonight, but congrats on the quarter and I appreciate you taking our question. I guess, first, as we\u2019re seeing kind of an increased willingness here, you noted kind of several customers throughout the quarter looking to standardize across your Clinical Suite and leverage those solutions. It makes a lot of sense to have all of this data across a common platform, right, to accelerate the development. So, I guess, the question is, how should we be thinking about the importance of further standardization, the future driver supporting the cross-sell efforts, especially related to some of the earlier stage offerings, CTMS, CDMS, safety, et cetera?\nPeter Gassner: And Dylan, this is Peter. I\u2019ll take that one. What\u2019s going on is, they\u2019re looking for an integrated suite, not so much -- standardization on technology is nice and that\u2019s useful. They will get a common vendor that they can trust, common way to do audits, common way to do the integrations, that type of thing. But the real benefit that they\u2019re looking for is common business practices. So, when we have the clinical operations suite integrated with the Clinical Data Management Suite and that can be seamless flow across there. That\u2019s what\u2019s exciting people. And that will just be a long-term competitive advantage for Veeva because clinical trial efficiency, that has extra importance to a life sciences company. That\u2019s the essence of a life sciences company, getting products approved to market quickly. So, it\u2019s not the standardization of technology but it\u2019s the seamless business process that they\u2019re looking for.\nDylan Becker: And then, maybe one for Paul, too. And I don\u2019t want to dig kind of too deep into it, but I guess, can you talk about -- well, you just kind of mentioned some of the early traction around the Data Cloud piece. But, as this kind of is a driver of sustainability on the commercial side as well and kind of some of the releases that we\u2019ve seen from IQVIA in recent days here, can you remind us if, and kind of what any impact this might have on that Data Cloud segment as well?\nPaul Shawah: Yes. There\u2019s no impact in terms of IQVIA, and there\u2019s obviously been a lot of noise in the marketplace and kind of their competitive behaviors that they have a history of, but that really has no impact at all on Data Cloud. Data Cloud\u2019s our own product. It\u2019s data that we\u2019re sourcing and innovating in a really different way for the marketplace. So, no material impact that we -- no impact at all, I should say, around Data Cloud.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Stephanie Davis with SVB Leerink.\nStephanie Davis: Thank you for taking my question, guys. And congratulations on a very strong quarter. We\u2019ve seen a pretty meaningful uptick in funding for health tech companies that compete with the Vault related products. So, I love your early take on how you\u2019re thinking about these players. Should we think of them as more pure-play competitors that are just subscale, or is there a potential partnership and integration that maybe increase the value of Vault as a platform?\nPeter Gassner: Hey Stephanie, this is Peter. Yes,, certainly, not just in health tech overall, the market, early market\u2019s awash with capital right now. And so, you get multiple new entrants. Now, you get lower quality entrants on the average because you\u2019re getting diffusity and monies in a surplus. So, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s going on. In terms of some of those -- many of those will be competitors in one of our application areas. So, they will be a competitor in one of our application areas. I think that\u2019s overall good for the industry. It will sharpen Veeva\u2019s competitive focus and lead to product innovation. And then, some of them will be partners and really fit into the Vault platform nicely. Those will tend to be smaller, more practical, lower funded companies because the high funded companies, they have to go for the highest, highest market. I think that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s good competition. I think it\u2019d be difficult for them in many ways because the pharmaceutical companies are not looking for a quick win flash in a pan like that. They\u2019re really looking for a long-term partner that has a full suite. So, overall, I view the trend as positive for Veeva.\nStephanie Davis: Well, continuing on that thought of the less funded players and probably the most likely partners, how do you think about M&A for growing in that space?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. M&A, I would say not different in that space versus other places that we\u2019ve been in. We would look for M&A for growth. So, where we can get a seed of something that will really either help the industry overall and thereby help Veeva. You saw that with Zinc, right, we completed that acquisition or completed the migration of those customers with the acquisition five years ago, completed that. That was good for the industry, brought their DNA into Veeva, made our products better. You would see what we did with Crossix. We bought Crossix. They had a certain asset. We\u2019re leveraging that asset and bringing them to Data Cloud. So, that\u2019s what we would look for. We look for seed of innovation that we can grow.\nStephanie Davis: Very helpful. one quick one...\nPeter Gassner: Sorry, I didn\u2019t finish. Sorry\u2026\nStephanie Davis: No, no, continue.\nPeter Gassner: Those will often come in the smaller companies actually, those seeds of innovation.\nStephanie Davis: Impressive. So, I just have a quick one because I feel like Ato\u2019s done so much work on this. He would kill us if we didn\u2019t at least mention it on the call. Could you just\u2026\nPeter Gassner: He\u2019s a very nice guy. He\u2019s not going to kill anybody.\nStephanie Davis: He might so. So, you\u2019ve heard a lot of noise about IQVIA. Could you just give us a refresh on litigation, what the worst case downside scenario really is in some of the recent announcements?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, certainly a lot of noise. IQVIA issued a really intentionally misleading press release and disinformation campaign. But that situation there with their anticompetitive behavior, the case is all upside for Veeva because the status quo is this restricted data environment that IQVIA\u2019s created. So, that\u2019s the status quo. If -- nothing about this recent press release from IQVIA is really about the case. It\u2019s about a procedural -- the procedural ruling. So, our case, the antitrust case is going ahead. We expect the jury trial in 2023. And we are confident in our case and expect to win. Now, if we did win, that would really provide more choice for the industry, and that would be an accelerant for Commercial Cloud, if we would win. But, we\u2019ll see and that\u2019s in 2023.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Tom Roderick with Stifel.\nTom Roderick: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Great to hear from you all. Congratulations for the great results. Peter, I\u2019m glad Stephanie just kind of poked at the IQVIA thread there a little bit. And I guess, I wanted to ask a little bit of a different version of that question, which is, what are your customers saying to you about this? This is fairly sort of acrimonious discussions in the public arena between you and a competitor, both of which many, many of your customers use both parties. Are they getting nervous at all that perhaps IQVIA data might not be accessible inside of your CRM systems in the long run, that that could create some issues with respect to your core positioning on that front? I\u2019d love to hear what they\u2019re saying to you. And then, conversely, are they opening up and saying, hey, we really, really do want the choice, and it\u2019s about the time we get this choice. So, I\u2019d love to know which way they\u2019re pushing on that thread.\nPeter Gassner: Tom, I\u2019ll take that one. The customers, in general, they -- this is not positive for them. This is noise. So, they feel like, hey, there\u2019s two kids fighting on the lawn. They don\u2019t really care. Who started the fight or why, it\u2019s just noise for them. So, they don\u2019t appreciate it. I would say -- I think, they generally know that it\u2019s caused by IQVIA but still it doesn\u2019t matter. They don\u2019t appreciate it. They\u2019re not nervous with IQVIA, our customers, they\u2019re life sciences companies. They\u2019re really Veeva and IQVIA, we are the partners with suppliers to the industry. So, I don\u2019t feel any nervousness from our customers. They knew that if IQVIA would do something, like not allow their data into Veeva CRM, a, they\u2019d find another way to analyze that data; and b, they wouldn\u2019t appreciate that from IQVIA to end up IQVIA losing business. So, they\u2019re not willing to be pushed around by IQVIA. Where they think this is about is choice. So, I think Data Cloud, for example, that\u2019s really enthusiastic for the customers. They want us to hurry, get that mature faster, have a full complete faster. More choice is always a positive for Veeva. Noise about fighting in press releases, that\u2019s not a positive -- sorry, more choice is a positive for customers. Noise about lawsuits is never a positive for customers.\nTom Roderick: Great. That\u2019s excellent, Peter. I appreciate that. This is a little bit more in the weeds, but Brent, a question for you. I mean, we look at these gross margins and they\u2019re at all-time highs here. Seemingly, no reason why they can\u2019t continue. I guess, the one thing that stood out to me in the prepared remarks was the discussion point that the last Zinc customer has transitioned over to PromoMats. And it just sort of brings to mind anytime you can kind of end-of-life customers on one platform and move them all over to a modernized version, there might be lasting benefits to the gross margin line there. How should we think about other opportunities across the platform outside of that? And is this kind of a high watermark for gross margins or then how do we get higher from here?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. I mean, thanks for the question. Yes, this was an outstanding quarter, obviously, from an op margin perspective, the highest op margin quarter that we\u2019ve had to date. And how I think about it is, we\u2019re in growth mode right now. We\u2019re continuing to invest for customer success. And we\u2019re aggressively hiring specifically in the products, sales and services area. Business consulting is a focus area. So, we think that will pay off long term from a growth perspective. There are some other things that are in that are in play regarding our gross margin, as you look out during the course of fiscal year \u201822. We do expect travel to return to some level of normalization. There\u2019s services utilization was running at an all-time high this quarter as well. So, there\u2019s a lot of things that happened in Q1 that drove the high op margin percentage. So, all-in-all, pleased with it. Great opportunity to continue to get leverage out of the model as we continue to sell the Vault product space as well.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America.\nSherry Guo: Hi. This is Sherry on for Brad. Congratulations on a great quarter. I wanted to ask about the outside of life sciences opportunity. You touched a little bit on your prepared remarks. But, can you maybe provide some updates on where you are today and where you are in terms of building out that go-to-market organization? Thank you.\nPeter Gassner: Hi Sherry, this is Peter. Yes, we\u2019re on track with outside of life sciences there. We\u2019re focused on consumer goods and consumer packaged goods and chemicals. Maybe to add some customers and expand in existing customers, we believe we\u2019re on track to sort of in the $100 million, bringing the business for 2025. So, we\u2019re on track for that. I\u2019m really pleased with the customer success, and that\u2019s what\u2019s fueling our business there. So, all is going well outside of life sciences.\nSherry Guo: Got you. And then, are you seeing any changes in the app tech for like event services businesses or physicians world as COVID headwinds start to dissipate?\nPaul Shawah: Yes. Hey Sherry, this is Paul. Yes, we are starting to see that demand return. And I guess, I\u2019d characterize the demand around digital events, which is ramping up. That\u2019s been ramping up for some time now and we\u2019re really -- we focused our business on to supporting customers, doing digital events. But we\u2019re also starting to see a little bit of an uptick in more of the in-person events as companies are starting to think about the reopening and getting back face-to-face. So, yes, it is -- I expect that kind of demand to continue going forward. The good news is, we\u2019re focused on supporting both. So, as customers prefer, we can support whether it\u2019s digital or whether it\u2019s in-person.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Stan Zlotsky with Morgan Stanley.\nStan Zlotsky: I wanted to switch for a second to billings, and obviously, a very strong start to the year. Is there anything in billings that we need to be mindful of as far as maybe like onetime in the quarter? And how that -- the strength of billings to start the year, informed your overall confidence in the billings guidance increase for the full year?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. Thanks, Dan. Yes. So, in Q1, we had outstanding billings result growing at 26%. There were no onetime items in the quarter to note that that was a tailwind or a headwind to that number. So, that beat definitely formed our guide, a good portion of our guide as we looked out for the year. So, good broad-based strength with Dev Cloud and Services both contributing nicely. I would say in the beat, probably about two-thirds of that was on the subscription side and about a third in services. So overall, really good contributions to the billings growth rate.\nStan Zlotsky: Got it, perfect. And I wanted to just go back to one of the earlier questions around the headcount, the overall reduction in headcount across the health care and the pharmaceutical sales industry. How does that inform your thinking around Commercial Cloud growth for the remainder of this year?\nPaul Shawah: Yes. So, the reductions have not a meaningful impact on the rest of this fiscal year. We\u2019ve accounted for that into our modeling already. So, we don\u2019t anticipate any material impact one way or the other. It\u2019s already accounted for in our guidance. And typically, those kinds of things, whether we saw a smaller or a larger reduction, one, we\u2019ve modeled the name; and two, those things tend to play out over time, based on renewal cycles. So, really no change there.\nStan Zlotsky: I guess, what I was trying to say is as much as maybe those -- the potential head cuts -- headcount cuts would come in the back half of this year or begin to maybe impact you and you guys are on the long-term strategic annual plus contract. Is there a potential where we could see upside to the Commercial Cloud subscription revenue line if those cuts don\u2019t materialize, like you guys have been talking about for the last couple of quarters?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. So, Stan, it\u2019s Brent. So, for the fiscal year, so in my prepared remarks I mentioned it. So, we didn\u2019t see any increase in the reductions in Q1. And we do expect that to increase in the second half of the year. And that increase, in fact, is included in our guide. So, we contemplated that into the second half of fiscal year \u201822.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan Chase & Company.\nDrew Glaeser: Hey. This is Drew on for Sterling. You mentioned the return to travel and normalization of some of the operating expenditures. Are there any cost savings that you think are sustainable in the model after the post -- in the post-COVID environment?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. So, I\u2019ll talk about fiscal year \u201822 and what we\u2019re seeing a bit. So, we\u2019re seeing travel start to return to normalization. And that\u2019s going to progress starting in the next couple of months as we work through the balance of the year. I believe that advance will largely be virtual for the balance of the fiscal year \u201822. All of that\u2019s been contemplated into our guide, and that\u2019s why I explicitly stated about 175 bps of tailwind. Over time, how much of that will be permanent, time will tell. I don\u2019t feel confident with the information at hand to give you a number on that.\nOperator: And next question comes from the line of Chris Merwin with Goldman Sachs.\nKevin Kumar: Hi. Kevin here on for Chris. Thanks for taking my questions. Curious on Engage. It sounds like that was a tailwind to growth in the quarter. How penetrated is that product across the CRM customer base today and how should we think about the runway there?\nPaul Shawah: Yes. This is Paul. Engage, we talked about last quarter as being roughly 60% penetrated in the overall Engage market. So, if you think about the broader Engage opportunity, we have -- we\u2019ve captured roughly 60% of the market. And we\u2019ll expect to see continued growth in Engage, normalizing to where it was. We obviously had a significant bump in Q4, given the conversion. But that\u2019s -- that will play out over time where it will be more of a normalized growth rate going forward.\nKevin Kumar: Got it. And then, given the recent investments in headcount, curious about customer adoption, of the Crossix. Thanks.\nPaul Shawah: Yes. So, Crossix is generally independent of the kinds of reductions that you\u2019re seeing. I would say that there is an overall shift to companies operating more digitally and trying to reach customers in new and different ways. And fundamentally, Crossix\u2019 business is based on supporting media and advertising and marketing, which is digital. So, we saw good strength this quarter in Crossix and we anticipate that strength will continue going forward.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Ryan MacDonald with Needham.\nRyan MacDonald: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And I apologize if it\u2019s repeated. I dead dropped temporarily here. But, I wanted to ask on the prepared remarks about the commentary around Veeva Link and the Business Consulting services. I think it\u2019s been an interesting dynamic that the comment around it is doubling year-over-year in terms of consulting. It\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve heard that and it seems to be an emerging trend. Peter, I\u2019d be curious just to hear your thoughts on what do you think is causing sort of this increased reliance on consulting services from customers. And how does this change your view, if at all, on how the component of service as a percent of total revenue and how that grows going forward?\nPeter Gassner: In terms of the percentage revenue and how that grows going forward, I don\u2019t expect any material change there. Consulting business is growing but it\u2019s still small as when you look at the bulk of our business, which is actually subscription and professional services. Consulting is a bit, a higher-value service that focuses on business process -- business process type things, not just implementing our software. So, it\u2019s growing but it\u2019s never going to be the biggest part of Veeva, that type of thing. But it is complementary. So, it\u2019s been very complementary. And consulting needs will go up a little bit as we have multiple products. So, one of the things with consulting is very good for us, stitching together the business processes that are needed when you\u2019re implementing processes, for example, across clinical and regulatory or commercial and medical. So, that\u2019s where you get a lot of the value and when you redesign these business processes, roles and responsibilities. So, necessary and view it as icing on the cake, but it\u2019s not the cake.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi.\nUnidentified Analyst: Congrats on the result that looks pretty strong. And then, I just had a quick question regarding -- we are starting to see more customers going in full suite, especially in the last quarter and current quarter in like Quality and Regulatory and including new customers or in Commercial Cloud. So, I\u2019d just like to see how is this supposed to be in trend, like coming in versus your expectation initially? And then, also, what are some of the implications that we might see going forward? Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: Yes. The full suite, that can happen also on the R&D side and the Commercial side. Generally, that will be with smaller biotechs because they\u2019re nimble, they don\u2019t have existing infrastructure. They want to get started in a very-modernized way and they just go along with Veeva. So, I expect that trend to continue sort of as it is, maybe accelerate a bit in the small biotechs. But, that\u2019s not really so applicable to our large enterprises, because they have lots of people, lots of processes and they have to pick the parts that they optimize.\nOperator: That concludes all questions at this time. I would like to turn this call back over to Peter for closing remarks.\nPeter Gassner: All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to thank our customers for their continued partnership and our employees for their commitment to customer success. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brent Bowman",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Brian. Yes. So, services in general is not a good leading indicator, I would say. One thing to keep in mind is just -- there's just a lot of variability in services revenue. And why is that? Different products have different service requirements and customers have different needs, based on their in-house capabilities. But what I will say, we're very pleased with the overall service business, the strength that we saw on the development side and broadly. Yes. I mean, thanks for the question. Yes, this was an outstanding quarter, obviously, from an op margin perspective, the highest op margin quarter that we've had to date. And how I think about it is, we're in growth mode right now. We're continuing to invest for customer success. And we're aggressively hiring specifically in the products, sales and services area. Business consulting is a focus area.

I would say in the beat, probably about two-thirds of that was on the subscription side and about a third in services. So overall, really good contributions to the billings growth rate. Yes. So, Stan, it's Brent. So, for the fiscal year, so in my prepared remarks I mentioned it. So, we didn't see any increase in the reductions in Q1. And we do expect that to increase in the second half of the year. And that increase, in fact, is included in our guide. So, we contemplated that into the second half of fiscal year \u201822. Yes. So, I'll talk about fiscal year \u201822 and what we're seeing a bit. So, we're seeing travel start to return to normalization.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Peter Gassner",
            "content": "Thank you, Ato, and welcome to the call, everyone. We had an outstanding Q1 with results well ahead of guidance due to significant outperformance in Development Cloud and continued strength in Commercial Cloud. Total revenue in the quarter was $434 million, up 29% year-over-year, with subscription revenue up 26% to $341 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $181 million or 42% of total revenue. You will find further details about the quarter in our prepared remarks posted on our website at 1 Pacific today. At this point, I would like to open up the call to questions for Brent, Paul or myself. Yes, decentralized trials, that's part of what we call digital trials, so that's moving clinical trials to paperless and patient-centric. Decentralized trials itself refers to, most often, to being able to do parts of the trial process with the patient in the patient's home, still supervised by a caregiver, but that may be through an in-home nurse, or that may be through a Zoom call, something like that. So, we do have significant technology investment in that area and that will be ongoing. That's things like MyVeeva for patients, for example. That will fit into decentralized clinical trials. What we're doing for eConsent, our Site Connect product. And then, we'll connect that into our Clinical Suite for the sponsor. So, it's a big opportunity and area of investment. But for us, it could be a bit broader. It's what we call digital trials. Well, I'll play -- this is Peter and I'll play left fielder today and I got that one out of left field. So, we broadly -- you can characterize that as a preclinical. Some people would also characterize that as the research area of pharmaceutical. That's not an area where we're focused at this time when you keep an eye on it, and you never say never in the future. But that's not -- there's no ongoing investment or product from Veeva at this time. I would say it's lightly connected. That would be an area that would be lightly connected to the rest of our products, and we have no plans at this time. Thank you. Ken, that's fair to think that the customers are definitely reimagining things COVID, and across all industries has caused people to think maybe some assumptions that they had in the past were not valid. And so, now, they're trying to question everything more open to innovation, I think, tremendous downside of COVID in terms of loss of life, increasing mobility, that type of thing. But, it is spurring innovation. Adversity creates innovation. So, that is what's going on. So, there's questioning. When we look at replatforming, I think really, what I see from the customers is, yes, reimagining efficiency, digital data investment. And yes, I think we're getting a slight tailwind from that. Again though, we have a long cycle with our customers. So, it's not something that you're going to immediately see but that will be a continued and moderate tailwind for us for the next three, four years, really. And it's a positive trend when customers look to innovation, because our product footprint is well positioned. We did a lot of things as we moved into digital last year, especially with MyVeeva and the digital trials and Veeva Engage that position us well. So, I think we're in a good position and a favorable position, Ken. And Dylan, this is Peter. I'll take that one. What's going on is, they're looking for an integrated suite, not so much -- standardization on technology is nice and that's useful. They will get a common vendor that they can trust, common way to do audits, common way to do the integrations, that type of thing. But the real benefit that they're looking for is common business practices. So, when we have the clinical operations suite integrated with the Clinical Data Management Suite and that can be seamless flow across there. That's what's exciting people. And that will just be a long-term competitive advantage for Veeva because clinical trial efficiency, that has extra importance to a life sciences company. That's the essence of a life sciences company, getting products approved to market quickly. So, it's not the standardization of technology but it's the seamless business process that they're looking for. Hey Stephanie, this is Peter. Yes,, certainly, not just in health tech overall, the market, early market's awash with capital right now. And so, you get multiple new entrants. Now, you get lower quality entrants on the average because you're getting diffusity and monies in a surplus. So, I think that's what's going on. In terms of some of those -- many of those will be competitors in one of our application areas. So, they will be a competitor in one of our application areas. I think that's overall good for the industry. It will sharpen Veeva's competitive focus and lead to product innovation. And then, some of them will be partners and really fit into the Vault platform nicely. Those will tend to be smaller, more practical, lower funded companies because the high funded companies, they have to go for the highest, highest market. I think that's fine. It's good competition. I think it'd be difficult for them in many ways because the pharmaceutical companies are not looking for a quick win flash in a pan like that. They're really looking for a long-term partner that has a full suite. So, overall, I view the trend as positive for Veeva. Yes. M&A, I would say not different in that space versus other places that we've been in. We would look for M&A for growth. So, where we can get a seed of something that will really either help the industry overall and thereby help Veeva. You saw that with Zinc, right, we completed that acquisition or completed the migration of those customers with the acquisition five years ago, completed that. That was good for the industry, brought their DNA into Veeva, made our products better. You would see what we did with Crossix. We bought Crossix. They had a certain asset. We're leveraging that asset and bringing them to Data Cloud. So, that's what we would look for. We look for seed of innovation that we can grow. Sorry, I didn't finish. Sorry... Those will often come in the smaller companies actually, those seeds of innovation. He's a very nice guy. He's not going to kill anybody. Yes, certainly a lot of noise. IQVIA issued a really intentionally misleading press release and disinformation campaign. But that situation there with their anticompetitive behavior, the case is all upside for Veeva because the status quo is this restricted data environment that IQVIA's created. So, that's the status quo. If -- nothing about this recent press release from IQVIA is really about the case. It's about a procedural -- the procedural ruling. So, our case, the antitrust case is going ahead. We expect the jury trial in 2023. And we are confident in our case and expect to win. Now, if we did win, that would really provide more choice for the industry, and that would be an accelerant for Commercial Cloud, if we would win. But, we'll see and that's in 2023. Tom, I'll take that one. The customers, in general, they -- this is not positive for them. This is noise. So, they feel like, hey, there's two kids fighting on the lawn. They don't really care. Who started the fight or why, it's just noise for them. So, they don't appreciate it. I would say -- I think, they generally know that it's caused by IQVIA but still it doesn't matter. They don't appreciate it. They're not nervous with IQVIA, our customers, they're life sciences companies. They're really Veeva and IQVIA, we are the partners with suppliers to the industry. So, I don't feel any nervousness from our customers. They knew that if IQVIA would do something, like not allow their data into Veeva CRM, a, they'd find another way to analyze that data; and b, they wouldn't appreciate that from IQVIA to end up IQVIA losing business. So, they're not willing to be pushed around by IQVIA. Where they think this is about is choice. So, I think Data Cloud, for example, that's really enthusiastic for the customers. They want us to hurry, get that mature faster, have a full complete faster. More choice is always a positive for Veeva. Noise about fighting in press releases, that's not a positive -- sorry, more choice is a positive for customers. Noise about lawsuits is never a positive for customers. Hi Sherry, this is Peter. Yes, we're on track with outside of life sciences there. We're focused on consumer goods and consumer packaged goods and chemicals. Maybe to add some customers and expand in existing customers, we believe we're on track to sort of in the $100 million, bringing the business for 2025. So, we're on track for that. I'm really pleased with the customer success, and that's what's fueling our business there. So, all is going well outside of life sciences. In terms of the percentage revenue and how that grows going forward, I don't expect any material change there. Consulting business is growing but it's still small as when you look at the bulk of our business, which is actually subscription and professional services. Consulting is a bit, a higher-value service that focuses on business process -- business process type things, not just implementing our software. So, it's growing but it's never going to be the biggest part of Veeva, that type of thing. But it is complementary. So, it's been very complementary. And consulting needs will go up a little bit as we have multiple products. So, one of the things with consulting is very good for us, stitching together the business processes that are needed when you're implementing processes, for example, across clinical and regulatory or commercial and medical. So, that's where you get a lot of the value and when you redesign these business processes, roles and responsibilities. So, necessary and view it as icing on the cake, but it's not the cake. Yes. The full suite, that can happen also on the R&D side and the Commercial side. Generally, that will be with smaller biotechs because they're nimble, they don't have existing infrastructure. They want to get started in a very-modernized way and they just go along with Veeva. So, I expect that trend to continue sort of as it is, maybe accelerate a bit in the small biotechs. But, that's not really so applicable to our large enterprises, because they have lots of people, lots of processes and they have to pick the parts that they optimize. All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. I'd like to thank our customers for their continued partnership and our employees for their commitment to customer success. Thank you."

            "name": "Paul Shawah",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Brian. This is Paul. Yes, we did have another strong quarter overall in Quality, really broadly across Development Cloud and in Quality in particular. And I guess, I'd started at the highest level, the unified vision that we have in Development Cloud is working, and Quality is just a perfect example where we're bringing together documentation with quality management with training, and they're all progressing really, really well. Customers are buying into that overall vision, and then they're rolling out and kind of driving that vision over time. So, we had really strong performance in QualityDocs and really in all of the areas. And companies are looking to modernize in the Quality space, and they're looking at Veeva to be that partner to help them there. So, we're really pleased with our progress. Yes, sure. I can give you some color on that. This is something we watch and keep an eye on very closely. There's always some variability up and down every quarter. But, we haven't seen any of the reductions so far that we've talked about, I guess, two quarters ago now. But, having said that, I guess, maybe the context and the color behind that, these are significant changes. The industry hasn't yet hit a new steady state and stabilized yet in terms of what the field structure is going to look like. So, these are big changes for pharma companies, which is why I think it will take a little bit longer. And I think we'll start to see that impact closer to the second half of this year and then likely through the end of next year. So, I wouldn't classify it as a walking back. I classify it more as just happening a little bit more over time. Yes. So, we're certainly focused on the U.S. market at this point. And as you know, our first product in Data Cloud is patient data. We will, as you mentioned, have prescriber and sales data over time. So, the focus right now is patient data. It's on building the best patient data product and longitudinal patient data and it's working in the early market. So, we're really proud of the success and the value that we're creating for customers in the early market. In terms of pent-up demand, this is a long journey. We're investing for the long term here. We're excited about the innovation, and our customers are excited about the innovation we can deliver. But they recognize that this is really a long-term play. So, really for the long haul, and we're excited about the progress we've made so far. Yes. There's no impact in terms of IQVIA, and there's obviously been a lot of noise in the marketplace and kind of their competitive behaviors that they have a history of, but that really has no impact at all on Data Cloud. Data Cloud's our own product. It's data that we're sourcing and innovating in a really different way for the marketplace. So, no material impact that we -- no impact at all, I should say, around Data Cloud. Yes. Hey Sherry, this is Paul. Yes, we are starting to see that demand return. And I guess, I'd characterize the demand around digital events, which is ramping up. That's been ramping up for some time now and we're really -- we focused our business on to supporting customers, doing digital events. But we're also starting to see a little bit of an uptick in more of the in-person events as companies are starting to think about the reopening and getting back face-to-face. So, yes, it is -- I expect that kind of demand to continue going forward. The good news is, we're focused on supporting both. So, as customers prefer, we can support whether it's digital or whether it's in-person. Yes. So, the reductions have not a meaningful impact on the rest of this fiscal year. We've accounted for that into our modeling already. So, we don't anticipate any material impact one way or the other. It's already accounted for in our guidance. And typically, those kinds of things, whether we saw a smaller or a larger reduction, one, we've modeled the name; and two, those things tend to play out over time, based on renewal cycles. So, really no change there. Yes. This is Paul. Engage, we talked about last quarter as being roughly 60% penetrated in the overall Engage market. So, if you think about the broader Engage opportunity, we have -- we've captured roughly 60% of the market. And we'll expect to see continued growth in Engage, normalizing to where it was. We obviously had a significant bump in Q4, given the conversion. But that's -- that will play out over time where it will be more of a normalized growth rate going forward. Yes. So, Crossix is generally independent of the kinds of reductions that you're seeing. I would say that there is an overall shift to companies operating more digitally and trying to reach customers in new and different ways. And fundamentally, Crossix' business is based on supporting media and advertising and marketing, which is digital. So, we saw good strength this quarter in Crossix and we anticipate that strength will continue going forward."

        "content": "Ato Garrett: Good afternoon, and welcome to Veeva's Fiscal 2023 Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Earnings Conference Call for the quarter and year ended January 31, 2023. As a reminder, we posted prepared remarks on Veeva's Investor Relations website just after 1:00 p.m. Pacific today. We hope you have had a chance to read them before the call. Today's call will be used primarily for Q&A. With me today for Q&A are Peter Gassner, our Chief Executive Officer; Paul Shawah, EVP, Commercial Strategy; and Brent Bowman, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding trends, our strategies, and the anticipated performance of the business, including guidance regarding future financial results. These forward-looking statements will be based on our current views and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the risks listed in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our most recent filing on Form 10-Q. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today, March 1, 2023, based on the facts available to us today. If this call is replayed or viewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Veeva disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We may discuss our guidance on today's call, but we will not provide any further guidance or update in our performance during the quarter, unless we do so in a public forum. On the call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today's earnings release and in the supplemental investor presentation, both of which are available on our website. With that, thank you for joining us, and I'll turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you, Ato, and welcome everyone to the call. We had a strong finish to the year with results ahead of our guidance for the quarter and year. Thanks to great execution by the Veeva teams across all areas. We're early in the significant industry cloud opportunity, and we are executing well. It was a breakout year for clinical data management, and we saw a great traction in newer areas such as Safety, Link and Compass. Our innovation engine is strong and our strategic partnerships with the industry are increasing. We issued guidance for fiscal '24 and initial guidance for fiscal '25 to provide context for the one-time revenue impacts to 2024 related to TFC. Normalizing for TFC and FX, we expect revenue to grow about 15% in fiscal '24 and at least 15% in fiscal '25. At this point, we'll open the call to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions]. We'll go to Brent Bracelin, Piper Sandler.\nBrent Bracelin: Good afternoon, Peter. I really appreciate your kind of long-term thinking here. And so this one is kind of aimed squarely at you here. I would love to get your initial thoughts on how Veeva is thinking about incorporating AI and large language models into the business. Is there an opportunity to lean in here to either lower cost internally around AI? Or are you thinking about new revenue streams via new products that you could build on kind of these AI advances in large language models? Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: Hey, good question about AI. Well, certainly, ChatGPT kind of taken the world's imagination by storm, and it is a significant type of technology. I won't go too long into that, but it's significant. But to answer your questions, Brent, I don't see any opportunity to really lower internal costs, most of what we do is relationship based and the selling and the marketing and innovation base, true innovation base and construction in the product area. So I don't see anything there. As far as for value for our customers, that's something we'll consider over time. We won't rush into it. We have a lot of data in Veeva in the industry cloud overall for the industry. And then we have data -- we have our customers' data for each customer. So there's potential that we can do some things to answer some questions about the industry overall, for and/or help the customer answer some questions about their internal operations. And I do think the large language models are going to be, I think, in the chat type interface. Ask about a question, get a relatively low quality answer that you can kind of move forward from for there. So I think there's a place for it. I don't think it's a revolution, and we'll just see how it goes.\nBrent Bracelin: Helpful color. And then one quick follow-up for Brent. Really appreciate the initial kind of milestone for fiscal 2025, here implies a rebound to 19% overall growth. In our forecast, it does suggest that the R&D business could rebound and normalize back to 25%, 30%. Is that the right way to think about the drag in R&D and this year and then kind of a normalization in R&D growth the following year. Is that the right way to think about the impact here with accounting shift?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. So, thanks, Brent. We're really excited about the momentum we're seeing in the R&D business. It's a key obvious growth driver for us as we look out '24, '25 and beyond with particular strength in the clinical space, quality, so really broad-based strength. So, it is really driving that growth that you're seeing as you look out into 2025.\nBrent Bracelin: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Next up is Brian Peterson from Raymond James.\nBrian Peterson: Hi, thanks for taking the question. And so, I wanted to hit on your success in EDC with six of the top 20 customers on the full. Maybe talk about what's driving that success, and then I'd love to understand, Brent, maybe how to think about the revenue ramp of those deals? Like how long would those typically get to be fully up to like the fully penetrated ARR?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, I can take those. This is Peter. We're really happy with the success of EDC. I guess sometimes things come in bunches. And three of the top 20 in one quarter, I wouldn't expect that every quarter, because we'll run out of the top 20 very quickly, right? It happens like that. Why is it happening? Why did it happen all in the same quarter? That's a series of coincidences really. But why is it happening overall, and we've been saying this for many years, it's just a better EDC product, more complete, it's true cloud and it comes from Veeva, which we have a clinical operations suite and a clinical data management suite. And that's what customers want. These are long projects. So full revenue on some of these projects, you're looking at sort of three to five years type of thing. Now they're not all the same, and so -- and I'm not saying that some might not be two and some might not be six. But if you look at three to five years, that's kind of a good thing to think about there. So it's a long-term revenue.\nBrian Peterson: Right. [Indiscernible].\nPeter Gassner: If I just add a little color, that's the clinical -- the EDC, that's -- there's a lot more to the clinical data management suite too, that's very significant over time. Randomization trial, supply management, ePRO, our clinical database and here will be more. So, I think you should think about EDC almost like you thought about eTMF as the start of our clinical operations. So, it's big and significant, but it's the overall clinical data management is even bigger.\nBrian Peterson: No, that's good to hear. And it sounds like there's a lot of good news in clinical. And maybe pivoting to the commercial side, I know this was in the prepared remarks a little bit, but just in terms of the CRM transition to Vault, any early feedback that you can share from customers that you've heard? I'd love to get any perspective on that. Thanks guys.\nPaul Shawah: Yes, I can take that. This is Paul. Yes, so the Vault CRM is going really well pretty much across all dimensions. We have the product development team working hard. I'd say they're ahead of schedule. We're actually going to have a demo. Our first demo at our summit coming up in May. So that's super exciting. I'm excited about that. I know our customers want to see that. There's not a whole lot our customers need to do right now, but we are having conversations with a number of them. And by and large, the feedback is positive. We're just trying to understand what this means for them and what timing looks like and what's entailed. And our job is to make it really easy for them to move. So yes, overall going really well with all CRM.\nBrian Peterson: Thanks Paul.\nOperator: Next up is Joe Vruwink, Baird.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Hi, everyone. Peter, in the prepared remarks, there was a mention of kind of early momentum in some of the newer areas like safety, which is a hard one to get into, but also something like Link, I think is one of the more successful new products for commercial in some time and then, of course, Compass. When you step back and you think of this pod of newer products, and then you maybe rewind and think about the introducing of like submissions or EPM, the part of kind of your first go after in the clinical areas. Do you think the opportunity ahead is just as compelling and consequential as kind of that mid-2010s timeframe for Veeva?\nPeter Gassner: It's a really thoughtful question. I wouldn't draw the exact parallel, but I think the parallel is similar. The reason why is in R&D, there's multiple very separate entry points. Safety is quite a bit different than clinical, it\u2019s quite a different than regulatory. In the commercial area, sales, medical and marketing, things are more related, and they're more fluid together. So it's not distinct entry points. It's all related buyers. But in terms of yes, a second leg of things really increasing our potential. That's absolutely what's happening. We have our established of the CRM suite and the commercial content actually. And then we have Crossix, which is pretty well established, but has a lot of room to grow. It has some advertising headwinds right now, but it has room to grow. And then we have things that are very, very early Link and especially Compass. Those are broad things and can lead into other add-on type of things. So, I think you're pretty accurate in the way you're saying it. It's the second leg of commercial is things like Link and Compass and business consulting as well.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. That's great. And then maybe, Brent, just a question on reconciling the margin outlook. So, there's some immediate impacts of the TFC T&E is coming back. Is there kind of another category of incremental spend as you think about next year and related to maybe that thought there was a comment in the remarks of just the evolution of Compass and taking your time to get it right and kind of introducing some new things in 2024? Would that maybe be an example of an area that's receiving incremental investment?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. Thanks, Joe. So, if you look at the margin guide, I think you nailed it pretty well. So when you adjust for the termination for convenience, you get to -- that's about 250 basis points of impact. So you get to about 36.5. And then there's about another point coming in to travel and events. We had recently, our first in-person field kickoff event in a number of years. So we're kind of getting back to normal to a normal run rate around getting in front of customers and getting together. And then there is a continued investment for growth. And Compass is one of a number of areas where we're going to continue to invest where we see an opportunity to drive our durable business model.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. Thank you very much.\nBrent Bowman: Thanks Joe.\nOperator: Our next question is Ken Wong, Oppenheimer.\nKen Wong: Great. Thanks for taking my question. This is for, I guess, it could be Peter or Paul -- but back to the CRM, the transition. Just wondering with this demo that you guys are going to have in May, how should we think about what this new CRM looks like? Is it really just sort of a lift and shift of what you've got today on sales force? Or is there going to be a bit of a reimagination to optimize for the evolved AWS back end?\nPaul Shawah: Yes, hey Ken, this is Paul. So yes, good question. The way to think about it is -- it's primarily a lift and shift. So we're moving the apps that the vast majority of our end users touch every single day remain the same. And those apps today point to sales force and in the future will point to Vault. So that's the simple way of thinking about it. And we're -- that's a design decision by us. Now why are we doing it that way? One, because it's a market-leading CRM, the CRM works. And it works really well for our customers, and it's going to make the move much easier for our customers to get there. So that's how we're thinking about it, and that will be -- that will play out just really easy for the end users. Like everything stays the same. One day, it's pointing the sales force, and the next day, it's pointing the Vault. So there's a lot of engineering work to make that happen. So we'll start to showcase some of that starting at our summit and then more and more as we -- as time goes on.\nKen Wong: Got it. Great. Thanks a lot, Paul. And then for Brent, just a quick clarification on '25. I know it's super early, but just the margin goals would suggest kind of in that 35-ish range, I guess, 35.5, give or take. Should we think of that as more of a generic plug similar to what you previously mentioned in the long-term target, so kind of just mirroring that? Or is that a reasonable expectation for how you're envisioning the margin expansion from '24 to -- from '24 to '25?\nBrent Bowman: All right, Ken. So what we said is at least $1 billion in operating income. So we're two years out, and that's above our long-term target of 35% plus. And we're going to continue balancing growing revenue as well as the investments required around that. So it's early. We feel good about how we're executing, and we're going to deliver at least $1 billion of op income.\nKen Wong: Got it. All right. Fantastic guys. Thank you.\nBrent Bowman: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is Anne Samuel, JPMorgan.\nAnne Samuel: Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. I was hoping maybe you could walk us through what headwinds and tailwinds you incorporated within the 2024 revenue guidance. And to the top end of your revenue range imply any improvement in the macro backdrop?\nBrent Bowman: Yes, I'll take that. So what we've assumed in our guide for the year is really the continuation of what we started to see in June from a macro perspective. So we haven't assumed any improvement nor worsening in the macro that we continue to see June through the balance of the year, and that's some items like Peter mentioned the advertising spend, a little bit headwind in Crossix. We assume that into our guidance as well as some of the SMB capital conservation that we saw in the back half of the year. So that's what's informed into our guide as you look out to fiscal year '24. I think you had a second question, if you wanted to repeat it.\nAnne Samuel: No, that was really helpful. And then maybe just -- I was hoping you could walk through the cadence of just the pricing adjustments how those will flow through the model? Because I think you said in your prepared remarks, you don't expect much in fiscal 2024. So how much should we expect this year? And how should we think about the cadence going forward?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. So what we -- so we announced effective April 1st going forward that we'll have a price increase of the lower of 4% or CPI. So how to think about that for '24, it's not going to have a material impact on our revenue. If you think about Q4 is our largest renewal quarter. It'll have more of an impact on billings in fiscal year '24. And then it'll be more impactful on revenue in fiscal year '25. But realize it could take a few years for that to fully play through, because we have customers on multi-year arrangements. You have to come up for renewal. So it will take a few years to see the full amount play through.\nAnne Samuel: Helpful. Thank you.\nBrent Bowman: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Will go to Stephanie Davis, SVB Securities.\nStephanie Davis: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could tell us more about the large Crossix wins. Are you seeing a renewed interest in MV digital commercialization tools despite the tough ad environment? When we think about it, will folks be more reactive in adopting these solutions once the market starts to improve. So we could see kind of a fast follower sort of dynamic?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, Stephanie, I believe your question broke up in the beginning. So could I ask you to repeat that?\nStephanie Davis: Yes, sure thing. It's just the large Crossix wins and kind of if this is going to be something we see people prepping for the environment improving an ad? Were they going to add that ahead of it or if they adopt their solutions once the market kind of starts to improve as the reactive [indiscernible]?\nPeter Gassner: Okay. Yes, the enterprise type deals in Crossix, I think that we're working on some more of those. Now it's undetermined when those are going to come in. I don't think those are really correlated too much with the headwinds in advertising. That's more long-term things that people are thinking about. Do they want to standardize and have a common operating model across all their brands and go forward with an enterprise approach or do they want to have the budgets brand by brand. So -- it's just a slow evolution to more of an enterprise buy that's not affected by the ups and downs of advertising.\nStephanie Davis: All right. Understood. And as a follow-up one on the CRM business. You guys called out a number of SMB wins. Can you tell us how and who you're winning against? I mean because we spent so much time, but the transition away from the sales force last quarter. Is that factoring into any of these conversations as you go through it?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. We're continuing to win. Our win rate really hasn't changed in CRM. We continue to execute really well. And the competitive environment is pretty much the same. It's all of the same players. So the way to think about it is these are generally one of two categories. It's either pre-commercial companies, SMBs that are in either the U.S. market or the European market, or its domestic companies that you may see in Japan as an example. So those are the kinds of companies that we're winning and we're winning against traditional competitors. So it's the -- they may not have anything if they're a pre-commercial company, they may be buying their first CRM system. If it's a domestic and maybe a local competitor or some of the traditional competitors that we've seen.\nStephanie Davis: All right. Helpful as always. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is Gabriela Borges, Goldman Sachs.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Kevin on for Gabriela. Thanks for taking the question. From a capital allocation standpoint, Peter, can you talk about doing M&A? How are you thinking about doing M&A and realize you're being patient there and trying to find the right asset, but -- what are you seeing in the private markets from a competitive standpoint? And maybe how does that play into your R&D strategy? Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: Yes, always no change in our M&A strategy. It was quite careful, right? Look for a cultural fit, look for a business fit and something that we can execute on. And those opportunities are rare. I would say we're looking more than we have in the past. But if you compare Veeva to three years ago, we have more effort in the M&A area. So we're scouring the market more. And we've always got a few things in the hopper and they most likely don't come through for a variety of reasons. I still am bullish over the next year or two that we can have something, because I think people are getting a bit more realistic on their valuation and they're realizing that there's not going to be a quick turnaround. So I wish I could give you a schedule of acquisitions, but I can't, but I'm really proud of our acquisition track record, and I think that will continue.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks Peter.\nPeter Gassner: Thanks.\nOperator: Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley has the next question.\nCraig Hettenbach: Yes. Just a question on the operating margins in the implied 35.7% in fiscal '25 or at least that much. Can you just talk about the hiring pace and things you're doing this year after what was a very strong fiscal '23? And what environment you're seeing out there as you're looking to hire?\nPeter Gassner: And I can take that one. This is Peter. The environment is good. It's a more favorable hiring environment than it was 12 months ago, I would say. And I expect that favorable hiring environment to continue for multiple reasons. This is a well-run company. I think people like to work at a well-run company. I think our work anywhere helps. And I think there's less froth and speculation in the market. But we'll be -- we'll really be measured in our hiring, and we've always done that. So we look at where we can grow and we can invest. We keep our teams lean. That's an important thing we do, and we always want to run a good profitable business. So I think the way to think about it is sort of business as usual as Veeva. We don't go crazy in the boom times, and we don't cut back drastically in the tough times. We sort of just keep rolling right over those speed bumps.\nCraig Hettenbach: Got it. And then just a follow-up on the macro backdrop. It was a little choppy at calendar year, some softness in the middle part of the year, and then it stabilized. Just curious on that on kind of the Crossix business and SMB, where it did soften a little bit. It sounds like there hasn't been much change in recent months. But if you can provide any color there in terms of any types of influence you're seeing in the macro today?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. In terms of the macro over the last 90 days, we really haven't seen any change over the last 90 days. Now that's no predictor of who knows what happens 90 days from now, but we don't see any signs -- I don't see any signs of rapid change right now. It seems like we're -- for a while now we're in a point of consistency, which overall, that's good for Veeva, because we're deal in core capabilities to improve efficiency and effectiveness. And when there's less change in the macro, either for the crazy up or the crazy down, that's what helps us a lot. When there's less change in the macro, people look to build these durable -- our customers look to build these durable capabilities.\nCraig Hettenbach: Thank you.\nPeter Gassner: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Rishi Jaluria, RBC Capital Markets.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Peter, let me start by diving a little bit deeper into the generative AI piece and less in terms of how it impacts your engineering and software development efforts. And more I want to think about what is the impact on the actual industry itself. I mean we saw recently, right? There's a pharma company that is putting a drug through clinical trials soon and the entire drug was designed by generative AI. So there clearly seems to be potential disruption coming to the industry from generative AI. Can you maybe talk about what you think that could happen -- what impact that could have on your customers and how you think that will impact your business? And then I've got a follow-up.\nPeter Gassner: Well, pretty early on that. I didn't read that exact press release. I would be surprised if no human touch that drug during its development and its approval. And so I don't think that probably happened. I think there's promising things in the early phase of discovering a drug, and that's not actually really due to the large language models or the generative AI. That's more to machine learning algorithms that are math based. So I guess I don't want to be a skeptic here, but I don't see the real revolution. And that's the thing about revolution. You'll know it when they happen. And so far, we really haven't seen it.\nRishi Jaluria: Okay. Totally fair. I appreciate that. And I wanted to think about the impact from a number of drugs coming off patent this year and maybe next 18, 24 months? Obviously, the big one with AbbVie's Humira -- how are you thinking about the potential puts and takes on that? Is that going to have an impact on the number of pharma reps and maybe lead to further cuts, which has an impact on the CRM business? And maybe conversely, given the patent close coming off, can that be a tailwind for R&D as some of the big companies try to iterate on drugs faster and get new drugs, blockbuster drugs out to market. Thanks.\nPaul Shawah: Yes, I can take that. This is normal course of business for the industry. As you look out over the next five years compared with the last five years, the amount of revenue that's at risk over the next five years as a percentage of the overall industry revenue is actually slightly less than the last five. So it's kind of an interesting patent thing. It happens. This is normal course of business for the industry. Now what tends to replace the revenue from those drugs that lose their patent expiration is new medicines. So you brought up the AbbVie example. There's -- and this is in the public domain and there's expectations that new medicines from AbbVie will be just as large, if not larger, than Humira was in the marketplace. So that's very common, right? The industry invest a lot in R&D, they innovate and new medicines replaced the revenue from previous medicines, which to your point earlier, means more clinical trials, it means more launches, more drug approvals, and then ultimately, it means sales reps continue to sell and launch these new medicines. So it's kind of this virtuous cycle in the industry, I expect that to continue, if not get stronger because of the amount of investment the industry is making.\nRishi Jaluria: All right, great. Really helpful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Up next is Saket Kalia, Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hey, thanks for taking my questions here. Paul, maybe for you, just a little bit off that last line of questioning. I was wondering if you could talk about what you're hearing from customers on just overall pharma sales reps plans -- pharma sales rep plans for this year, calendar '23. I think it was said in the prepared remarks that Veeva actually saw CRM -- Veeva CRM sees flat year-over-year. How do you think about that for next year?\nPaul Shawah: Yes, so this calendar year, I expect it to be roughly flat also. But I'll take a little bit of a step back and just to paint the overall picture for you and for others that may not have been following us closely. So we've always talked about roughly a 10% reduction through the last fiscal year, we've seen the majority of that play out. This year, we expect we'll see some additional reductions play out. But I think it's going to stabilize, the market is going to hit and operate at this new steady state. And I think will actually end up slightly less than the 10% that we predicted. So we're seeing signs that the market is stabilizing. But I think this year, we'll have some gains in CRM in the CRM suite, but we'll also see a slight reduction in the market, so you can think of it as relatively flat.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. That's very helpful. Brent, maybe for my follow-up for you. For TFC, I think going back to the Analyst Day, we're expecting about a $60 million impact. I think that's a little bit higher now as we look at the '24 guide. Can you just talk about some of the mechanics there? What changed and also just remind us whether the TFC is going to have any impact on billings or cash flow?\nBrent Bowman: Yes, hi Saket. Yes, so in the Q3 time frame, we quoted a $60 million termination convenience impact and that was from existing deals in place at that time. You fast forward, we had a very successful Q4 quarter. We closed three large CMS deals. And with that, we added another $15 million of revenue pull forward. So that's $60 million to $75 million. And then in addition to that, there's about $20 million of anticipated deals that we expect to close in fiscal year '24 that would have pulled forward revenue. So when you add the 75 and the 20, you get to 95, and I think that's very prudent to consider when you're looking at the growth rates year-on-year. So that's how to think about it.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. And just to clarify, no real impact to billings or cash flow. This is really an accounting point for rev rec, correct?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. And really -- yes, to follow up. So there's no impact in the total revenue value of these contracts. It is purely timing. And to your point, there is no impact to billings and no impact to OCF.\nSaket Kalia: Very helpful, thanks guys.\nOperator: We will take a question next from Dylan Becker, William Blair.\nDylan Becker: Hey guys. Congratulations in the quarter. Appreciate you for taking the questions. Maybe following up on the TFC piece and understand kind of some of the near-term accounting dynamics. But how are you guys thinking about that incremental multiyear kind of willingness and adoption maybe for Peter as validation of kind of that long-term strategy you guys have kind of called out and maybe as for Brent as well as kind of giving you some of that initial confidence and outlook as we think about giving guidance for fiscal 2025?\nPeter Gassner: Well, I'll take the first part of that. Certainly, the Vote of confidence from the customers in the EDC area, in the clinical data management area, which is one of the more critical and one of the most complex things and the long multiyear rollout. Yes, we take that as a vote of confidence and we're really humbled by that, and we know we got to execute really well. So that's where we feel like in clinical data management, we've got a sort of a tiger by the tail, and we got to pay attention and make sure we deliver on that. So yes, very excited about that. And how that flows through to the financials, that's for Brent?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. And when you asked about how we look at the forecast, we do our forecast at a pretty granular level. We work with the business and think about it at a product level, at a market level, area level as well. And these ramping deals play into that as well. So when we combine all of those, that informs our guide, and we feel good about looking out at 2025 at least $2.8 billion in revenue.\nDylan Becker: Got it. Super helpful. Maybe switching over to another area as called out on the Compass side of the equation, and kind of prioritizing dedicated sales teams. Is there anything to call out in the go-to-market piece, any kind of sales that needs to change there? And then maybe how that evolves and maybe benefits from the broader rollout of the sales and subscriber piece in fiscal 2024 as well.\nPeter Gassner: I can take that one. In general, we have structured our sales team in terms of the commercial sales team and the R&D and quality sales team. And so they have a lot of products that they represent, and that helps our customers, helps Veeva be a strategic partner, and that's what our customers want. Sometimes when a product is different enough or new enough or something is different about it, we'll have a specialized sales team and we made that decision for Compass. It's a very specific product, and it's going to be a big product. It has a kind of an entrenched competitor. So no change in our philosophy. We always have that philosophy every year, we sort of make those decisions, whether we need a specialized sales team. So -- that's a decision we made some number of months ago and feel real comfortable with it.\nDylan Becker: Got it. Super helpful. Thanks guys.\nOperator: And we'll go back to Charles Rhyee, Cowen.\nCharles Rhyee: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on Crossix a little bit more. Peter, I think you said that the macro doesn't really affect the selling cycle for Crossix, it's really a decision whether someone wants to go enterprise or state -- brand by brand. But you have called out a little bit of weakness in this category. What is the client saying in terms of maybe not moving forward? I know you signed a top 20 pharma here in this -- or you announced this quarter, but for others where people are not willing to move forward yet, what is sort of their talking points as to why they're not interested or maybe not yet looking to do it?\nPeter Gassner: Well, I think when overall, the media spend goes down then that has a negative effect on Veeva because, let's say, a brand is going to be TV advertising and then it feels like why that I really want to measure that with Crossix versus if they decide to. I'm not going to do TV advertising, we're going to conserve that budget, okay, then they might -- they wouldn't spend with Crossix to measure that. So that's where it has impacts on these. When customers are buying more ala carte, which is the bulk of our business still in Crossix. They're buying brand by brand, module by module when their spend goes down, they would conserve on their spend with Crossix. And also, when there's more confusion about where their budgets are going to be, then they tend to be a little less bullish on spending.\nCharles Rhyee: So then in that case, maybe not directly, but indirectly, it is still tied to the macro, maybe not so much the -- like an R&D budget kind of, but it's really just sort of a general economic macro environment is started.\nPeter Gassner: Yes, I guess to the general economic environment or more specifically to the advertising environment inside of life sciences. Now that again impacts more of the ala carte type of things we do, which is the bulk of our business in the Crossix, the year-to-year ala carte. And our goal is to move people more to these multiyear agreements where it's more of an enterprise agreement. It's not exactly an all you can eat, but sort of like that, but smooth out the spend and simplify things for ourselves and for our customers.\nCharles Rhyee: Appreciate that. And Brent, just a quick follow-up. I kind of missed it. I think someone asked earlier about the cadence for the impact of TFC, obviously, a bigger piece maybe in the first quarter, but as we model it through the rest of the year, how should we think about the rest of it falling through to more in the second quarter or even?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. So yes, $52 million is what we called out on the $95 million as an impact in Q1. And then the balance of that will continue in a diminishing way through the balance of the year. So Q3 will be less than Q2, and Q4 is expected to be less than Q3.\nCharles Rhyee: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Up next is Ryan MacDonald, Needham & Company.\nRyan MacDonald: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Peter, maybe first for you. It's great to hear the continued success, albeit at the early stages for the likes of Compass and Link. But I'd be curious to get your thoughts on what you're seeing in terms of sales cycles right now, sort of other competitors in the space talking about elongation and having issues there. Just curious if you're seeing any of that or -- and if you are, does this sort of benefit you in a way as it enables you to continue to mature the product offerings in the marketplace while maybe end market customers are digesting what they have. Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: I don't -- I think our macro environment has stabilized. I don't see any change in the deal scrutiny right now. Is it maybe a little bit more than it was a year-ago, maybe, but it's not appreciably so. So if we look at last year on the macro environment, probably percentage-wise, the larger impact was in the SMB area. When the funding goes down, companies have to conserve cash, they might merge, they might get acquired, they might get a -- go out of business. They have uncertainty so they wouldn't make decisions there. I think that has also stabilized. The funding environment is a bit more stable now. It hasn't gotten better, but it's stabilized. So I really am not seeing this impact of elongated sales cycles at this time. Now having said that, I always think for the past 15 years, I thought our sales cycles are long, and that's just got the nature of the business.\nRyan MacDonald: Thanks for color on that. I appreciate it. And maybe a follow-up for Brent. Obviously, with the expectation of sales and prescriber data coming into plan being generally available later this year, as that data set builds and as you build sort of the book of business for those data sets, will you see any gross margin pressure initially with the inclusion of those data sets while you're sort of in the early stages of monetizing it? Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: Yes, I can take that one. No, we don't see extra gross margin there from those products. We're always looking for data that we can add into the Crossix platform, but that data is really shared, patient data is the root of it. And then we do -- we transpose it, we do projections to get to the prescriber. So we'll add data incrementally, but I don't -- there won't be any large change when we get to the subscriber product.\nRyan MacDonald: Thanks for taking the questions.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you.\nOperator: Next up is Joe Goodwin, JMP.\nJoe Goodwin: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Great to see that quality, the quality, small quality suite is still moving forward well. I guess can you just elaborate on the Vault LIMS product that you're all working on and it's important to your position in the quality market?\nPeter Gassner: Right, you got about 30 minutes because I love that product. Here we go. All right. LIMS is interesting. It is for testing materials, largely pharmaceutical companies, biotech make materials in batches. They're not making units or making batches, batches of things that then would be packaged. And serious things that are either injected or intravenous into the human body. So the quality of them is super important for obvious reasons. LIMS is Laboratory Information Management System, what we call QC or quality control LIMS. That's where you keep the specifications of how you should test this medicine along the way of its life cycle. During its multi-day, could be week's process of making this medicine in the batch, what test should be done, and there's a whole variety of tests, some as simple as what's the color in the PH to some very sophisticated tests. Those specifications have to be designed and approved in the system and then data is entered in either through APIs or through manual. And that's the quality control process. That's a big part of the quality control process that then is used to see, hey, can we release this medicine in this market to be ingested or injected into humans. Very important area and we're going to build it inside of our quality Vault, which means it will become unified with our QMS system, our QualityDocs system and our training system. Nobody has ever done anything like that before. And I think it's going to be a real transformation in the quality control processes in life sciences, which will allow people to release their medicines faster, which is a real -- keeps the company much more agile. So this is very much top of mind in the supply chain area of our customer supply chain and manufacturing. It's a big product. It'll be one of our biggest ticket items in the quality suite. It's definitely not an add-on product to QMS or something like that.\nJoe Goodwin: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is Stan Berenshteyn, Wells Fargo Securities.\nStan Berenshteyn: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. On CRM migration, so when customers begin migrations, do you anticipate that in the year in which these migrations take place, that there may perhaps be some impact on new product uptake from those clients until perhaps the migrations are completed?\nPaul Shawah: Yes, so I would think of it as maybe three timeframes, before the migration, during the migration and after the migration, Certainly, before the migration, the way we're planning this, the way we've designed this is that new capabilities, new products that they do, we're going to migrate those automatically for customers. So we want customers to continue to innovate, and we'll move that innovation over within the Vault automatically. So that's before then during, it can be a small to a larger project, depending on the size of the company or their complexity. That may be a little bit of a distraction during that period of time. And then certainly after is an opportunity for even more innovation. So that's kind of generally how I would think about it. It's going to be -- it will be a project just like any other kind of project.\nStan Berenshteyn: Got it. And then maybe a quick question on R&D solutions. So it looks like this year, you added close to $220 million in revenue within R&D. Can you just share with us what percent of that amount came from top 20 pharma? And what percent came from pre-revenue biotech? Thanks.\nBrent Bowman: Yes, we're not going to break out that level of detail. But if you think about where our installed base and we get a large portion of our revenue from the enterprise and our top accounts. But -- so that's largely contributing. But we do have a good cross-section of customers that buy across the whole R&D solution set. So we're pleased with the success and how we're executing there.\nStan Berenshteyn: Great, thanks so much.\nOperator: We'll go to Jack Wallace, Guggenheim Securities.\nJack Wallace: Hey, thanks for taking my questions and starting to advance for the boring accounting questions. here we go.\nBrent Bowman: So this one for Peter, you're saying then, right? This is for Peter, the boring accounting question.\nJack Wallace: Exactly. So I want to just get a better understanding of the mechanics of the TFC impact. And I appreciate we had a couple of bigger deals that signed in 4Q and some anticipated it sounds like they're going to sign the rest of the deal. So the fundamentals are strong, but that means we're going to have less of an impact in the early years of those contracts on the revenue line. I think I get that part. The part I'm a little bit unsure about is the $52 million impact in the first quarter. So using simple math on subscription line, the $460 million from 4Q less the $52 million less the $8 million from FX, gets you to $405 million after you add, let's say, $5 million sequential. Now that $52 million of TFC, why doesn't that get annualized into a $208 million headwind for the year. If I'm thinking about that resetting the revenue base lower again, without the benefit of being able to recognize unbilled AR intra-year?\nBrent Bracelin: I mean the way to think about it is, so post-TFC world, you think about for the year, fiscal year '24, how much revenue would have been above billings? You think about it from that perspective, simply in that year. So there's the amount that relates to existing deals, and then there is the amount related to the $20 million, the deals we would have closed. So that you're normalizing back to that rule where billings and revenue need to be aligned. When you aggregate that all up for the full-year, it's $95 million. And the amount that impacts Q1 is $52 million, largely the unbilled AR portion. But that's at the highest, most simple way. That's how I think about it.\nJack Wallace: Got it. And just to clarify, the unbilled AR portion, that would be a -- I guess what you're saying, a onetime impact, to the 1Q, your revenue number that then say Q2 steps back by that amount or maybe something less than that?\nBrent Bowman: Yes, and it's simply a direct reduction to revenue at close to op -- operating income in Q1. I think -- but the important piece here is the total value of these deals is not diminished or impaired. It's over -- you're just taking that revenue and opt income over the remaining life of those individual orders, which could be an additional one year, an additional two year, three and four years and so on.\nJack Wallace: Got you and then just the last follow-up on that is with the headwind diminishing over the course of the year, is that related to the midstream deals that are operating, say, above the multiyear ACV?\nBrent Bowman: It's those deals, the remaining deals before renewal, where there's still an amount of revenue above billings. That's what -- that's the remaining residual, the 95 minus 52, and that amount is diminishing over Q2 through Q4.\nJack Wallace: Okay, thank you.\nBrent Bowman: You bet.\nOperator: Next up is Natalie Hao [ph], Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks for taking my question. You touched on R&D earlier and throughout this call, and I wanted to ask a little bit more on clinical. So you mentioned that you're only 5% penetrated in clinical data and 30% in operations. Does clinical represent an opportunity more for new customers or rather, does it target the existing base? And for my second question, still on R&D. You mentioned some strength in Development Cloud. What products coming in fiscal year '24 will help sustain the R&D growth rate that we can look forward to? Thank you.\nPeter Gassner: Okay. I'll take that one. This is Peter. In the clinical, a lot of that is going to be from existing customers, but that's for example, some of our most established products are in clinical, eTMF, and we have a lot of eTMF customers. To those customers, we can sell other clinical operations product, eTMF, study training and we can start to sell clinical data management. So they are existing customers, but we'll be getting into new departments in the way, I would think about it. In terms of brand-new customers, brand new, those are usually come in the small SMB companies that aren't commercial yet. They're just clinical. They're running their first couple of trials. They may or may not have our quality suite. And then in terms of where the revenue is coming from in Development Cloud, the real growth areas are for us, clinical area, both clinical operations and clinical data management, and also quality. Quality has a long runway to grow and a deep pipeline there. Regulatory and safety, those are contributing pretty well, but the two biggest ones are -- the biggest one is clinical and the second biggest is quality.\nUnidentified Analyst: Awesome, thank you.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you.\nOperator: And that was our final question. I'd like to hand the call back to Mr. Peter Gassner for any additional or closing remarks.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today, and thank you to our customers for your continued partnership and to the Veeva team for your outstanding work in the quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: And everyone, that does conclude today's conference. We would like to thank you all for your participation today. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brent Bowman",
            "content": "Yes. So, thanks, Brent. We're really excited about the momentum we're seeing in the R&D business. It's a key obvious growth driver for us as we look out '24, '25 and beyond with particular strength in the clinical space, quality, so really broad-based strength. So, it is really driving that growth that you're seeing as you look out into 2025. Yes. Thanks, Joe. So, if you look at the margin guide, I think you nailed it pretty well. So when you adjust for the termination for convenience, you get to -- that's about 250 basis points of impact. So you get to about 36.5. And then there's about another point coming in to travel and events. We had recently, our first in-person field kickoff event in a number of years. So we're kind of getting back to normal to a normal run rate around getting in front of customers and getting together. And then there is a continued investment for growth. And Compass is one of a number of areas where we're going to continue to invest where we see an opportunity to drive our durable business model. Thanks Joe. All right, Ken. So what we said is at least $1 billion in operating income. So we're two years out, and that's above our long-term target of 35% plus. And we're going to continue balancing growing revenue as well as the investments required around that. So it's early. We feel good about how we're executing, and we're going to deliver at least $1 billion of op income. Yes, thank you. Yes, I'll take that. So what we've assumed in our guide for the year is really the continuation of what we started to see in June from a macro perspective. So we haven't assumed any improvement nor worsening in the macro that we continue to see June through the balance of the year, and that's some items like Peter mentioned the advertising spend, a little bit headwind in Crossix. We assume that into our guidance as well as some of the SMB capital conservation that we saw in the back half of the year. So that's what's informed into our guide as you look out to fiscal year '24. I think you had a second question, if you wanted to repeat it. Yes. So what we -- so we announced effective April 1st going forward that we'll have a price increase of the lower of 4% or CPI. So how to think about that for '24, it's not going to have a material impact on our revenue. If you think about Q4 is our largest renewal quarter. It'll have more of an impact on billings in fiscal year '24. And then it'll be more impactful on revenue in fiscal year '25. But realize it could take a few years for that to fully play through, because we have customers on multi-year arrangements. You have to come up for renewal. So it will take a few years to see the full amount play through. Yes. Thank you. Yes, hi Saket. Yes, so in the Q3 time frame, we quoted a $60 million termination convenience impact and that was from existing deals in place at that time. You fast forward, we had a very successful Q4 quarter. We closed three large CMS deals. And with that, we added another $15 million of revenue pull forward. So that's $60 million to $75 million. And then in addition to that, there's about $20 million of anticipated deals that we expect to close in fiscal year '24 that would have pulled forward revenue. So when you add the 75 and the 20, you get to 95, and I think that's very prudent to consider when you're looking at the growth rates year-on-year. So that's how to think about it. Yes. And really -- yes, to follow up. So there's no impact in the total revenue value of these contracts. It is purely timing. And to your point, there is no impact to billings and no impact to OCF. Yes. And when you asked about how we look at the forecast, we do our forecast at a pretty granular level. We work with the business and think about it at a product level, at a market level, area level as well. And these ramping deals play into that as well. So when we combine all of those, that informs our guide, and we feel good about looking out at 2025 at least $2.8 billion in revenue. Yes. So yes, $52 million is what we called out on the $95 million as an impact in Q1. And then the balance of that will continue in a diminishing way through the balance of the year. So Q3 will be less than Q2, and Q4 is expected to be less than Q3. Yes, we're not going to break out that level of detail. But if you think about where our installed base and we get a large portion of our revenue from the enterprise and our top accounts. But -- so that's largely contributing. But we do have a good cross-section of customers that buy across the whole R&D solution set. So we're pleased with the success and how we're executing there. So this one for Peter, you're saying then, right? This is for Peter, the boring accounting question. Yes, and it's simply a direct reduction to revenue at close to op -- operating income in Q1. I think -- but the important piece here is the total value of these deals is not diminished or impaired. It's over -- you're just taking that revenue and opt income over the remaining life of those individual orders, which could be an additional one year, an additional two year, three and four years and so on. It's those deals, the remaining deals before renewal, where there's still an amount of revenue above billings. That's what -- that's the remaining residual, the 95 minus 52, and that amount is diminishing over Q2 through Q4. You bet."

            "content": "Thank you, Ato, and welcome everyone to the call. We had a strong finish to the year with results ahead of our guidance for the quarter and year. Thanks to great execution by the Veeva teams across all areas. We're early in the significant industry cloud opportunity, and we are executing well. It was a breakout year for clinical data management, and we saw a great traction in newer areas such as Safety, Link and Compass. Our innovation engine is strong and our strategic partnerships with the industry are increasing. We issued guidance for fiscal '24 and initial guidance for fiscal '25 to provide context for the one-time revenue impacts to 2024 related to TFC. Normalizing for TFC and FX, we expect revenue to grow about 15% in fiscal '24 and at least 15% in fiscal '25. At this point, we'll open the call to your questions. Hey, good question about AI. Well, certainly, ChatGPT kind of taken the world's imagination by storm, and it is a significant type of technology. I won't go too long into that, but it's significant. But to answer your questions, Brent, I don't see any opportunity to really lower internal costs, most of what we do is relationship based and the selling and the marketing and innovation base, true innovation base and construction in the product area. So I don't see anything there. As far as for value for our customers, that's something we'll consider over time. We won't rush into it. We have a lot of data in Veeva in the industry cloud overall for the industry. And then we have data -- we have our customers' data for each customer. So there's potential that we can do some things to answer some questions about the industry overall, for and/or help the customer answer some questions about their internal operations. And I do think the large language models are going to be, I think, in the chat type interface. Ask about a question, get a relatively low quality answer that you can kind of move forward from for there. So I think there's a place for it. I don't think it's a revolution, and we'll just see how it goes. Yes, I can take those. This is Peter. We're really happy with the success of EDC. I guess sometimes things come in bunches. And three of the top 20 in one quarter, I wouldn't expect that every quarter, because we'll run out of the top 20 very quickly, right? It happens like that. Why is it happening? Why did it happen all in the same quarter? That's a series of coincidences really. But why is it happening overall, and we've been saying this for many years, it's just a better EDC product, more complete, it's true cloud and it comes from Veeva, which we have a clinical operations suite and a clinical data management suite. And that's what customers want. These are long projects. So full revenue on some of these projects, you're looking at sort of three to five years type of thing. Now they're not all the same, and so -- and I'm not saying that some might not be two and some might not be six. But if you look at three to five years, that's kind of a good thing to think about there. So it's a long-term revenue. If I just add a little color, that's the clinical -- the EDC, that's -- there's a lot more to the clinical data management suite too, that's very significant over time. Randomization trial, supply management, ePRO, our clinical database and here will be more. So, I think you should think about EDC almost like you thought about eTMF as the start of our clinical operations. So, it's big and significant, but it's the overall clinical data management is even bigger. It's a really thoughtful question. I wouldn't draw the exact parallel, but I think the parallel is similar. The reason why is in R&D, there's multiple very separate entry points. Safety is quite a bit different than clinical, it's quite a different than regulatory. In the commercial area, sales, medical and marketing, things are more related, and they're more fluid together. So it's not distinct entry points. It's all related buyers. But in terms of yes, a second leg of things really increasing our potential. That's absolutely what's happening. We have our established of the CRM suite and the commercial content actually. And then we have Crossix, which is pretty well established, but has a lot of room to grow. It has some advertising headwinds right now, but it has room to grow. And then we have things that are very, very early Link and especially Compass. Those are broad things and can lead into other add-on type of things. So, I think you're pretty accurate in the way you're saying it. It's the second leg of commercial is things like Link and Compass and business consulting as well. Yes, Stephanie, I believe your question broke up in the beginning. So could I ask you to repeat that? Okay. Yes, the enterprise type deals in Crossix, I think that we're working on some more of those. Now it's undetermined when those are going to come in. I don't think those are really correlated too much with the headwinds in advertising. That's more long-term things that people are thinking about. Do they want to standardize and have a common operating model across all their brands and go forward with an enterprise approach or do they want to have the budgets brand by brand. So -- it's just a slow evolution to more of an enterprise buy that's not affected by the ups and downs of advertising. Yes. We're continuing to win. Our win rate really hasn't changed in CRM. We continue to execute really well. And the competitive environment is pretty much the same. It's all of the same players. So the way to think about it is these are generally one of two categories. It's either pre-commercial companies, SMBs that are in either the U.S. market or the European market, or its domestic companies that you may see in Japan as an example. So those are the kinds of companies that we're winning and we're winning against traditional competitors. So it's the -- they may not have anything if they're a pre-commercial company, they may be buying their first CRM system. If it's a domestic and maybe a local competitor or some of the traditional competitors that we've seen. Yes, always no change in our M&A strategy. It was quite careful, right? Look for a cultural fit, look for a business fit and something that we can execute on. And those opportunities are rare. I would say we're looking more than we have in the past. But if you compare Veeva to three years ago, we have more effort in the M&A area. So we're scouring the market more. And we've always got a few things in the hopper and they most likely don't come through for a variety of reasons. I still am bullish over the next year or two that we can have something, because I think people are getting a bit more realistic on their valuation and they're realizing that there's not going to be a quick turnaround. So I wish I could give you a schedule of acquisitions, but I can't, but I'm really proud of our acquisition track record, and I think that will continue. Thanks. And I can take that one. This is Peter. The environment is good. It's a more favorable hiring environment than it was 12 months ago, I would say. And I expect that favorable hiring environment to continue for multiple reasons. This is a well-run company. I think people like to work at a well-run company. I think our work anywhere helps. And I think there's less froth and speculation in the market. But we'll be -- we'll really be measured in our hiring, and we've always done that. So we look at where we can grow and we can invest. We keep our teams lean. That's an important thing we do, and we always want to run a good profitable business. So I think the way to think about it is sort of business as usual as Veeva. We don't go crazy in the boom times, and we don't cut back drastically in the tough times. We sort of just keep rolling right over those speed bumps. Yes. In terms of the macro over the last 90 days, we really haven't seen any change over the last 90 days. Now that's no predictor of who knows what happens 90 days from now, but we don't see any signs -- I don't see any signs of rapid change right now. It seems like we're -- for a while now we're in a point of consistency, which overall, that's good for Veeva, because we're deal in core capabilities to improve efficiency and effectiveness. And when there's less change in the macro, either for the crazy up or the crazy down, that's what helps us a lot. When there's less change in the macro, people look to build these durable -- our customers look to build these durable capabilities. Thanks. Well, pretty early on that. I didn't read that exact press release. I would be surprised if no human touch that drug during its development and its approval. And so I don't think that probably happened. I think there's promising things in the early phase of discovering a drug, and that's not actually really due to the large language models or the generative AI. That's more to machine learning algorithms that are math based. So I guess I don't want to be a skeptic here, but I don't see the real revolution. And that's the thing about revolution. You'll know it when they happen. And so far, we really haven't seen it. Well, I'll take the first part of that. Certainly, the Vote of confidence from the customers in the EDC area, in the clinical data management area, which is one of the more critical and one of the most complex things and the long multiyear rollout. Yes, we take that as a vote of confidence and we're really humbled by that, and we know we got to execute really well. So that's where we feel like in clinical data management, we've got a sort of a tiger by the tail, and we got to pay attention and make sure we deliver on that. So yes, very excited about that. And how that flows through to the financials, that's for Brent? I can take that one. In general, we have structured our sales team in terms of the commercial sales team and the R&D and quality sales team. And so they have a lot of products that they represent, and that helps our customers, helps Veeva be a strategic partner, and that's what our customers want. Sometimes when a product is different enough or new enough or something is different about it, we'll have a specialized sales team and we made that decision for Compass. It's a very specific product, and it's going to be a big product. It has a kind of an entrenched competitor. So no change in our philosophy. We always have that philosophy every year, we sort of make those decisions, whether we need a specialized sales team. So -- that's a decision we made some number of months ago and feel real comfortable with it. Well, I think when overall, the media spend goes down then that has a negative effect on Veeva because, let's say, a brand is going to be TV advertising and then it feels like why that I really want to measure that with Crossix versus if they decide to. I'm not going to do TV advertising, we're going to conserve that budget, okay, then they might -- they wouldn't spend with Crossix to measure that. So that's where it has impacts on these. When customers are buying more ala carte, which is the bulk of our business still in Crossix. They're buying brand by brand, module by module when their spend goes down, they would conserve on their spend with Crossix. And also, when there's more confusion about where their budgets are going to be, then they tend to be a little less bullish on spending. Yes, I guess to the general economic environment or more specifically to the advertising environment inside of life sciences. Now that again impacts more of the ala carte type of things we do, which is the bulk of our business in the Crossix, the year-to-year ala carte. And our goal is to move people more to these multiyear agreements where it's more of an enterprise agreement. It's not exactly an all you can eat, but sort of like that, but smooth out the spend and simplify things for ourselves and for our customers. I don't -- I think our macro environment has stabilized. I don't see any change in the deal scrutiny right now. Is it maybe a little bit more than it was a year-ago, maybe, but it's not appreciably so. So if we look at last year on the macro environment, probably percentage-wise, the larger impact was in the SMB area. When the funding goes down, companies have to conserve cash, they might merge, they might get acquired, they might get a -- go out of business. They have uncertainty so they wouldn't make decisions there. I think that has also stabilized. The funding environment is a bit more stable now. It hasn't gotten better, but it's stabilized. So I really am not seeing this impact of elongated sales cycles at this time. Now having said that, I always think for the past 15 years, I thought our sales cycles are long, and that's just got the nature of the business. Yes, I can take that one. No, we don't see extra gross margin there from those products. We're always looking for data that we can add into the Crossix platform, but that data is really shared, patient data is the root of it. And then we do -- we transpose it, we do projections to get to the prescriber. So we'll add data incrementally, but I don't -- there won't be any large change when we get to the subscriber product. Thank you. Right, you got about 30 minutes because I love that product. Here we go. All right. LIMS is interesting. It is for testing materials, largely pharmaceutical companies, biotech make materials in batches. They're not making units or making batches, batches of things that then would be packaged. And serious things that are either injected or intravenous into the human body. So the quality of them is super important for obvious reasons. LIMS is Laboratory Information Management System, what we call QC or quality control LIMS. That's where you keep the specifications of how you should test this medicine along the way of its life cycle. During its multi-day, could be week's process of making this medicine in the batch, what test should be done, and there's a whole variety of tests, some as simple as what's the color in the PH to some very sophisticated tests. Those specifications have to be designed and approved in the system and then data is entered in either through APIs or through manual. And that's the quality control process. That's a big part of the quality control process that then is used to see, hey, can we release this medicine in this market to be ingested or injected into humans. Very important area and we're going to build it inside of our quality Vault, which means it will become unified with our QMS system, our QualityDocs system and our training system. Nobody has ever done anything like that before. And I think it's going to be a real transformation in the quality control processes in life sciences, which will allow people to release their medicines faster, which is a real -- keeps the company much more agile. So this is very much top of mind in the supply chain area of our customer supply chain and manufacturing. It's a big product. It'll be one of our biggest ticket items in the quality suite. It's definitely not an add-on product to QMS or something like that. Okay. I'll take that one. This is Peter. In the clinical, a lot of that is going to be from existing customers, but that's for example, some of our most established products are in clinical, eTMF, and we have a lot of eTMF customers. To those customers, we can sell other clinical operations product, eTMF, study training and we can start to sell clinical data management. So they are existing customers, but we'll be getting into new departments in the way, I would think about it. In terms of brand-new customers, brand new, those are usually come in the small SMB companies that aren't commercial yet. They're just clinical. They're running their first couple of trials. They may or may not have our quality suite. And then in terms of where the revenue is coming from in Development Cloud, the real growth areas are for us, clinical area, both clinical operations and clinical data management, and also quality. Quality has a long runway to grow and a deep pipeline there. Regulatory and safety, those are contributing pretty well, but the two biggest ones are -- the biggest one is clinical and the second biggest is quality. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today, and thank you to our customers for your continued partnership and to the Veeva team for your outstanding work in the quarter. Thank you."

            "name": "Paul Shawah",
            "content": "Yes, I can take that. This is Paul. Yes, so the Vault CRM is going really well pretty much across all dimensions. We have the product development team working hard. I'd say they're ahead of schedule. We're actually going to have a demo. Our first demo at our summit coming up in May. So that's super exciting. I'm excited about that. I know our customers want to see that. There's not a whole lot our customers need to do right now, but we are having conversations with a number of them. And by and large, the feedback is positive. We're just trying to understand what this means for them and what timing looks like and what's entailed. And our job is to make it really easy for them to move. So yes, overall going really well with all CRM. Yes, hey Ken, this is Paul. So yes, good question. The way to think about it is -- it's primarily a lift and shift. So we're moving the apps that the vast majority of our end users touch every single day remain the same. And those apps today point to sales force and in the future will point to Vault. So that's the simple way of thinking about it. And we're -- that's a design decision by us. Now why are we doing it that way? One, because it's a market-leading CRM, the CRM works. And it works really well for our customers, and it's going to make the move much easier for our customers to get there. So that's how we're thinking about it, and that will be -- that will play out just really easy for the end users. Like everything stays the same. One day, it's pointing the sales force, and the next day, it's pointing the Vault. So there's a lot of engineering work to make that happen. So we'll start to showcase some of that starting at our summit and then more and more as we -- as time goes on. Yes, I can take that. This is normal course of business for the industry. As you look out over the next five years compared with the last five years, the amount of revenue that's at risk over the next five years as a percentage of the overall industry revenue is actually slightly less than the last five. So it's kind of an interesting patent thing. It happens. This is normal course of business for the industry. Now what tends to replace the revenue from those drugs that lose their patent expiration is new medicines. So you brought up the AbbVie example. There's -- and this is in the public domain and there's expectations that new medicines from AbbVie will be just as large, if not larger, than Humira was in the marketplace. So that's very common, right? The industry invest a lot in R&D, they innovate and new medicines replaced the revenue from previous medicines, which to your point earlier, means more clinical trials, it means more launches, more drug approvals, and then ultimately, it means sales reps continue to sell and launch these new medicines. So it's kind of this virtuous cycle in the industry, I expect that to continue, if not get stronger because of the amount of investment the industry is making. Yes, so this calendar year, I expect it to be roughly flat also. But I'll take a little bit of a step back and just to paint the overall picture for you and for others that may not have been following us closely. So we've always talked about roughly a 10% reduction through the last fiscal year, we've seen the majority of that play out. This year, we expect we'll see some additional reductions play out. But I think it's going to stabilize, the market is going to hit and operate at this new steady state. And I think will actually end up slightly less than the 10% that we predicted. So we're seeing signs that the market is stabilizing. But I think this year, we'll have some gains in CRM in the CRM suite, but we'll also see a slight reduction in the market, so you can think of it as relatively flat. Yes, so I would think of it as maybe three timeframes, before the migration, during the migration and after the migration, Certainly, before the migration, the way we're planning this, the way we've designed this is that new capabilities, new products that they do, we're going to migrate those automatically for customers. So we want customers to continue to innovate, and we'll move that innovation over within the Vault automatically. So that's before then during, it can be a small to a larger project, depending on the size of the company or their complexity. That may be a little bit of a distraction during that period of time. And then certainly after is an opportunity for even more innovation. So that's kind of generally how I would think about it. It's going to be -- it will be a project just like any other kind of project."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Veeva Systems Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Ato Garrett, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nAto Garrett: Good afternoon, and welcome to Veeva Systems Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call for the quarter ended October 31, 2022. As a reminder, we posted prepared remarks on Veeva's Investor Relations website just after 1:00 p.m. Pacific today. We hope you've had a chance to read them before the call. Today's call will be used primarily for Q&A. With me today for Q&A are Peter Gassner, our Chief Executive Officer; Paul Shawah, EVP, Commercial Strategy; and Brent Bowman, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding trends, our strategies and the anticipated performance of the business, including guidance regarding future financial results. These forward-looking statements will be based on our current views and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially.  Please refer to the risks listed in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our most recent filing on Form 10-Q. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today, December 1, 2022, based on the facts available to us today. If this call is replayed or viewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Veeva disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.  We may discuss our guidance on today's call, but we will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. On the call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today's earnings release and in the supplemental investor presentation, both of which are available on our website. With that, thank you for joining us, and I'll turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Gassner : Thank you, Ato, and welcome everyone to the call. We had a strong Q3, delivering results ahead of our guidance. Total revenue in the quarter was $552 million, up 16% year-over-year, and subscription revenue was up 16% to $442 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $219 million or 40% of total revenue. Despite the difficult macro environment, we continue to execute well. Our innovation engine is strong and our strategic partnerships with the industry are increasing. We also had a record hiring quarter and a very strong quarter in clinical with some significant wins. We also announced that we are moving Veeva CRM to the Veeva Vault platform over time. This will allow us to deliver a better application and a better customer experience. At this point, we'll open up the call to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Ken Wong with Oppenheimer.\nKen Wong : And Peter, I wanted to, I guess, just dive straight into the move to Vault with CRM. You guys are definitely keeping us on our toes these last few quarters. maybe just for some clarity, when we think about the contract ending in '25 and then a grace period through '30. Does the noncompete with Salesforce also end in '25. And just would love your take on what that migration path looks like, what would be some potential hurdles that might slow down that transition? And then I got a follow-up for Brent.\nPeter Gassner: Yes, Ken, it is the contract goes until 2025. So that's where we're not competing together in the market there. That's according to the contract. And then there's a wind down period for existing customers that starts in 2025, and that goes to 2030. So it's business as usual. There's nothing could change about today and the customers are supported with Veeva CRM until 2030. We expect to have early adopters on the Vault CRM in 2024, some early adopters, and then the majority moving on 2025 or so, that's when we'll be selling mainly well CRM and customers will migrate over time. They have plenty of time. So that's the basic of how to think about it, Ken.\nKen Wong : Okay. Fantastic. And then, Brent, just quickly on the numbers. In terms of the slight reduction in the clinical subscription or R&D subscription, is that due primarily just to FX, or are there some impact from the billing dynamics that you called out in the prepared remarks or perhaps some macro?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. Overall, yes, we're happy with R&D Solutions growing at about 18%, adjusted for FX on a full year basis. The little bit of reduction you're seeing is a combination of 2 things. One is the FX incremental as well as a little bit of deal timing. So the 2 things, what drove a little bit of reduction.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Peterson with Raymond James.\nBrian Peterson : So we're getting a lot of questions from investors on the new agreement. And from a financial perspective, is it right to use accrued fees payable to sales force that you guys disclosed and kind of annualize that number on the potential impact that you guys would save? Or would there be some offsetting cost to that?\nBrent Bowman: If you look out to our 2025 targets. We don't expect there to be a material impact. We're still tracking about a year ahead inclusive of this new announcement. We don't anticipate there to be any real significant investments required. We're going to largely leverage our internal resources and also the power of our Vault platform. Beyond 2025, that's a long time out there. Yes, there is some accounts payable. You can see in our quarterly financials. That's a monthly number. So you can use that as a ballpark estimate.\nBrian Peterson : And maybe just a follow-up. You mentioned last quarter that we've seen some volatility in sales cycles. I'd just be curious how that progressed throughout the quarter? It sounded like there were some really strong clinical results, but would love to get any color there.\nBrent Bowman: Yes. So really happy with the momentum. Those few deals we talked about in Q2 did close in Q3. So we're very pleased about that. So overall, from a macro perspective, we've seen kind of similar to what we said 90 days ago, not better, not worse. And that's basically a little bit of additional scrutiny that we saw 90 days ago, but nothing significantly different than that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dylan Becker with William Blair.\nDylan Becker : Maybe Peter, to -- I think you highlighted some strength in EDC. We spend a lot of time talking about the complexity of a clinical data management piece and the opportunity to expand beyond just per EDC. I know you guys have introduced a number of functional areas here, but can you give us a sense of how you're thinking about putting together that I think you guys have logged those, right, the proverbial Rubik's cube around the sources and stakeholders there, not just from an existing process perspective, but unlocking and addressing almost an entirely new set of workflows and capabilities.\nPeter Gassner: Yes. So in the clinical, it's right that those are two very significant wins in the quarter. Two top 20s that selected our EDC. That's a very, very core application at the heart of the clinical data management and then there are more applications that we are bringing out and have bought out the RTSM, randomization and trial supply management, patient-reported outcomes, our CDB product. So that's -- when you look at clinical operations, us getting eTMF in there early with a sign of very good things to come. And us getting EDC in at these large companies, that's a sign of very good things to come in clinical data management. And then, you\u2019re right, that\u2019s we read into broader future for us in clinical as we connect up the clinical research sites, and there's many, many applications we can make on top of this as we connect. So clinical, I'm super excited about we're in the very, very early days of clinical, especially the clinical data management area.\nDylan Becker : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe from a hiring perspective, as we look at it, to already added kind of more headcount than any prior period here or any prior year. I guess how should we think about investment? Obviously, a lot of new initiatives and kind of that 2020 that 2030 growth framework, but how should we be thinking about kind of the resource allocation and obviously a further pace of hiring down the road here?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, it's a great hiring environment. People are looking for quality companies, stable companies doing great work, where they can feel aligned to the values and do their best work. the shiny penny of the crazy start-up idea is not so shiny anymore. So it's a great hiring environment. We'll really invest across all areas of the business: sales, services and specialty product but you're not going to see anything dramatic from Veeva. You'll see the measured pace that we go at. We really focus on the quality hiring. We've often come in under our hiring targets. And if this grade environment continues, we -- hopefully, we won't come in under our hiring targets anymore. So I'm really pleased about that. That's a leading indicator of for Veeva when we can hire great people.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anne Samuel with JP Morgan.\nAnne Samuel: I was hoping maybe you could speak a little bit to the rationale behind moving away from the MedTech CRM. You spoke fairly positively to at the Investor Day. So just wondering maybe what shifted?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, Ann, this is Peter. MedTech CRM and the Pharma CRM, they share a common foundation. You have to do those things together. So with moving need the CRM to the Vault platform. We really had to prioritize Pharma CRM first, take care of our existing customers, get that base set up. And then, yes, MedTech CRM that may come later, but we needed to prioritize the sequence since these applications are tightly interrelated.\nAnne Samuel: That makes a lot of sense. And then just you had a lot of really nice outperformance on the operating income line in the third quarter. you held on to the full year guidance. So I was just wondering, is there any shift of expenses there or anything incremental in 4Q that we should be thinking about?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. Regarding Q4, it's always our seasonally lower operating margin quarter. Why is that? Service Services utilization with the holidays is always a factor as well as kind of the reset on benefits and payroll tax type items. So that's a big seasonal reduction you will see. And then we're continuing to invest for long-term growth. Those are the two factors, but nothing else unusual.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.\nCraig Hettenbach: Just following up on some of the macro commentary. Any sense in terms of just what you're seeing from a number of add-ons and any tightening on that front kind of quarter-to-quarter?\nPaul Shawah : Yes. The others are pretty similar to what we've seen over the last couple of quarters. I think in we were talking to you back in June, we highlighted a little bit of a slowdown in the SMB space that particularly the lower end fewer expansions, not getting any -- not improving significantly or not worsening either. So really haven't seen much of a change there.\nCraig Hettenbach: Got it. And then just a question on Crossix you called out is growing about 10%. And clearly, the broader advertising market has been under pressure, but that's an area of relative strength. Just what you're seeing in that market and any sense of when that market could maybe start to reaccelerate again? Any visibility into that?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. Certainly, the overall, a little bit of caution in the advertising spend as far as when that would turn around or stay the same or get worse, I really don't have a crystal ball on that. What our focus on that project is just increasing the value from the application. So increasing functionality, increased integration with our other CRM products -- CRM-related products and moving to more multiyear agreements, enterprise license agreements with customers to provide a baseline of revenue and stability and service for the customers. So really excited about the Crossix business. I think we have a clear road map, and it's going quite well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs.\nGabriela Borges: Paul, Peter, could you walk us through what the transition looks like for a customer to switch from CRM with Salesforce to CRM with Vault? And more specifically, is there a risk that they look to evaluate competitive products when they do that transition?\nPeter Gassner: So when it looks like really we're you could think about as moving the back end of the application, the back-end platform, and we'll have migration tools that will bring the data across, including the customers customization and still be able to use all their content that they've developed, their multichannel e-mail templates. And we'll use the same front-end applications such as on the iPad. So that's what it will look like. We'll develop a lot of tooling. The customer will have integrations to ride, things like that. And in terms of competitive it's only out there, right? It's always a competitive market, whether you're moving platforms or not, and you have to continue to mind your customer relationships, continue to add value and innovation.  So I don't really see anything different there. And the main thing is we're replatforming the application CRM. We're not rewriting it. We're not introducing any kind of a new paradigm. So I feel comfortable that the vast majority of customers will migrate over time. And I guess the other thing is that the Veeva Vault platform is a very mature application. The bulk of Veeva's revenue is on the Veeva Vault application, and that's where our customers actually have the majority of their Veeva business for most of them is on the Veeva Vault platform. So I think overall for customers, this is a positive that simplifies their landscape.\nGabriela Borges: The follow-up is for Paul. I believe last quarter, you talked about budget planning at your customers hitting full swing into the second half. So just looking for an update here, what are you hearing on commercial budgets into 2023 and willingness to invest? And specifically, the response to the pricing increases? Is there any negative impact on your ability to cross-sell because perhaps budget is fixed?\nPaul Shawah : Yes. No significant change on the budget side. Our customers have gone through that timing process, and we haven't really seen any pricing pressures. When you think about the industry, particularly in the large enterprise, they're not -- it's not as susceptible to some of these macroeconomic changes, and we haven't seen any change there. You had a second question, which was around the inflation increase that we've had. And by and large, we haven't seen any -- it really has been pretty seamless with our customers. And the reason is we built that have a long history of being a trusted partner. We haven't historically had any license pricing increases. So our customers know this is a different environment. And by and large, it hasn't been an issue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird.\nJoe Vruwink: Just staying on the CRM conversation. In the past, I think you've acknowledged that typically customer conversations are separate and distinct between commercial and R&D orgs. Yet the shareholder letter made some comments about how a common platform for both now makes sense. So I'm wondering, are customers approaching you differently, thinking about procurement differently or is Veeva seeing new product opportunities that will benefit by uniting the two offerings?\nPeter Gassner: So no change in customer behavior, Joe. And I would say, yes, primarily, our customers are concerned with the excellence of the application in their area. But as they get more Veeva applications and more Vault applications, they do look for synergies there, synergies in -- they might create a Veeva Vault center of excellence, that type of thing for efficient operations. Or they may be auditing the Vault platform, and it's easier just to audit on platform. So we see that there. And then the connectivity between the applications, between R&D and commercial, specifically, between clinical, medical and commercial, that's something we do see opportunity there. And I think Veeva will help drive that. Some customers are asking for that. But I think mainly, we're going to be leading the way there. And you really haven't had great solutions for that connectivity, and I think we'll bring innovation there and connectivity that will create the market there.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. That's great. And then I have one question on the numbers and specifically just on 4Q billings, I think the outlook last quarter implied something like $927 million, and now the guidance is $909 million. Brent, is that just the deal timing that's influencing the Vault -- the new guidance. So we're kind of looking at an annual impact and one number and the quarterly impact in the other?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. I mean part of it, Joe, you're right. There always is some quarterization. So that's why we always say kind of look at it on a full year basis. Q3 benefited about $6 million. I just more annual billers that would have otherwise likely build in Q4. So that's part of the equation. But it's just a little bit of timing of renewals in those annual billers. So there's nothing fundamental to the business. We're very, very happy with the momentum, as Peter mentioned, around the clinical space in the EDC space. So really good business momentum and no underlying business concerns around the billings.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan MacDonald with Needham & Company.\nRyan MacDonald : Maybe first one for Peter. You talked about in the prepared remarks about the impact of sort of having the first milestone Vault Safety customer live now. I would just be curious, given that you spoke at the R&D Summit, what you're seeing in terms of increased customer conversations or pipeline development sort of off of that event and the go-live here?\nPeter Gassner: Excellent question there. I guess to step back, where we have a safety application that's a very complex applications. It's case processing of what's called adverse events, somebody takes a medicine and they either have a bad reaction or they think they have a bad reaction and then has to be classified and routed and recorded to health authorities, et cetera, around the world. So it's a very complex application. We're really the first company able to do that as a cloud-native application. That means just like we do everything else, there's one version of the code and all customers run it. So that's a breakthrough. Our customers are used to on-premise applications, they have to upgrade lots of issues. Now that this customer is live. This is the top 20, one of the larger top 20 customers.  Now there's proof that, that works. And I think, I wouldn't say all the way, but mainly customers are thinking, I probably will go with Veeva for safety. And then the question is when, is it next year? Is it 3 years from now, 5 years from now, 7 years from now? So that's really the significance of it. Now we have, of course, the work's never done. I'll never be satisfied with our safety application side. It always has to get better and better and better. But it was a very significant milestone, for the industry and for Veeva. And also just the other thing I'd add, the speed that, that implementation happened, I won't quote the exact numbers of days, was probably about half the time that most customers would have expected that it would have taken. So that was also seriously noticed by the industry.\nRyan MacDonald : That's a pretty impressive implementation time and go lifetime. That's helpful color.\nPeter Gassner: Can you tell that I'm enthused about that?\nRyan MacDonald : Just a bit, just a bit. Maybe my second question is around the Merck strategic relationship or partnership there. I'm curious, and this sort of relates to the CRM strategy here. But in a strategic relationship like that, I'd be curious within your discussions, how important it was to Merck to have sort of this unified platform of everything being involved, in a type of long-term 10-year strategic relationship there? And how much that sort of guided the strategic decision-making here on the CRM change?\nPeter Gassner: In terms of Merck, I won't get into any details specifically there on Merck. I would say that in a strategic agreement of that nature, generally, we're not talking at the platform level there. We're more talking about operating model, how we operate together, how we -- the governance model and it's only done based on trust over many years when they see repeated patterns of a customer success orientation of a strategic partnership orientation, and then it's really the governance model that we put in. So it would be at a higher level versus individual products or platforms.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi.\nTyler Radke: Wanted to ask you just -- you talked about some large Vault EDC customers, I believe that you signed in the November time frame. Could you just give a little bit of color on that? Is that -- were those kind of some displacements of kind of the main incumbent in the market? And just give us a sense on the size of these contracts and kind of the opportunity in those accounts.\nPeter Gassner: Yes, these were wins with top 20 customers. And they were -- yes, they have to be displacing one of the market leaders because people do need an EDC application. And so in both cases, we're displacing one of the top 2 market leaders there other than Veeva. And then in terms of the deal sizes, I won't specifically say in that area, but EDC is one of our larger applications. So it would be one of our -- these are larger deals. They're certainly some of our largest deals. Now these will ramp over multiple years because with the EDC application, you start study by study by study. So it's a commitment for a long-term approach, but the revenue ramps very slowly, actually, slower than most of our applications, that's the way that goes.  So right now, our -- we are progressing faster with EDC than I would have thought. If you would have asked me in '20 -- in the start of 2020, would we be where we are today with EDC, I probably wouldn't have been as bullish as what's actually happened. So our focus is going to be extremely on the customer success there because the EDC also is the -- it's the first part of clinical data management. So that's that's we're focused on. We're really happy with it, and we're going to be laser-focused on having implementations just be outstanding and improving our product through the feedback of these large customers. We have to do a lot of things there, right? Customer success, staffing and services. It's a great work to do, but we got to get better all the time.\nTyler Radke: Yes, that\u2019s great to hear. And maybe on Compass, turning to that, it sounded like you made some comments around continuing to optimize the approach there. Could you just give us an update on how that\u2019s tracking relative to plan? And kind of when you\u2019re expecting that revenue ramp and the timing of when we start to see that in the numbers.\nPeter Gassner: Yes. At Compass, that\u2019s certainly a marathon. That\u2019s a tough market. You have a very entrenched player there that has some questionable business practices that make it hard. We\u2019re happy with our progress on the product, and we have a smallish set of early adopters. I won\u2019t go into the specific count of customers. As to when we really start to generate momentum in the revenue, it\u2019s going to be low. It\u2019s not going to be next year. It\u2019s a very long-term play. I\u2019m confident in our position in the market and our product strategy. I\u2019m confident that the market needs competition. But that one is going to be a marathon, and you just have to stay tuned for milestones. That\u2019s the thing about great milestones. You don\u2019t actually know when they\u2019re coming, but we\u2019ll let you know when they get here.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephanie Davis with SVB Securities.\nStephanie Davis: I know we've beaten this to death about the risk when we've been off of the Salesforce platform, but I thought I'd add to it. Could you walk us through the WIP associated moving off of it. Is this hiring platform engineers? Is this resources that you already have? Or should we think of this as effectively built out as you've already had entrants like med tech built on the Vault platform?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. Stephanie, I'll take that one. The main thing to know is that when we build applications on Vault, we're highly efficient. We're highly efficient on that. So there's a lot of work that has gone into the platform. So we don't see really material incremental investment. And then we're using much of the parts of the CRM application. We're just porting over the back end. So for example, we have a very robust iPad client for Veeva CRM. It has all types of functionality into it. We're not going to rewrite that application at all. So that's why the investment is just -- it's not material to the rest of Veeva, it's because of the leverage, both in the existing application footprint, template and code and then the leverage we get from the Vault platform.\nStephanie Davis: Asking this in kind of a different way from a user perspective, are you taking more of an origin approach and bringing the same look and feel as you move to the new platform? Or are there any opportunities in the 3 platforms you switched to either improve the CRM platform in your experience or offering?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. Excellent question. In general, we're going to re-platform the back end. So we're not going to change up the user experience or do dramatic things at that time. Now having said that, we have an existing road map for CRM that's been -- we've really been executing on. So our customers have a lot of new functionality for example, engage new features that we have engaged, engage Connect that allows compliant messaging between doctors and sales reps. That's just starting to get adopted now. because that's a thing that needs compliance oversight. That's going to continue right into Vault CRM. So I would think of it as re-platforming the back end and reinvigorating the front end and the functionality that just keeps going on. That's been going on for a while, and that will continue on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler.\nBrent Bracelin: Peter, you've lived through a few economic cycles. I'd be curious to get your view around what aspect of the pharma MedTech industry is a little unique that maybe investors don't appreciate. We're seeing obviously a pretty material slowdown in growth profiles of some of the largest cloud software vendors. And so what parts of the market you serve, maybe are underappreciated levers that allow you to kind of sustain durable growth? I mean is it a trusted partner relationship? Is it having these multiyear road maps that they're going to continue to execute and expand products? Is it just the fact that it's tied to really large, strong vendors. Just trying to think through some of the slowdown we're seeing in other vendors in the cloud space and perhaps a bit of a different picture here from your lens?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. There's a lot of ways to think about that one. I will start with last year and the year before, it's been quite unusual, right? We haven't seen the interest rate rise this far or this high since the early '80s and the same with inflation going up this high and raise this fact into early '80s and a war in Europe like this, I haven't seen in my lifetime. So these are unusual times.  Having said that, what makes Veeva -- the factors that are going in Veeva's favor, first, I would say our customer feeling, our customer success viewing and track record of success that we've built up over time. That is a tremendous insulator in downturn -- in downtimes. Also the nature of the industry, the industry when it's not recession-proof, but very recession resistant. This is not like our airlines or hotels or luxury items, things like that, restaurants. People need their medicine in good times and bad. Medicine is a critical part of health care without medicines, health care costs go up, et cetera. So the spending doesn't change too much.  The segment where it is affected a little bit is in smaller private companies that if the funding environment goes down, they can't get as much funding. They have to be more conservative with their expansions. And then I would say the last thing is the type of products we do. They are mission-critical systems of record. Good times are bad. You need your clinical trial management system. Just like you need your financial system and you need your ERP system.  What you may not need is the speculative piece of technology or add on, on the top of that. That's maybe what you don't need. And we focus really on system of records. So we have that going in favor for us. So I think a lot of things going in our favor for stability. We do best in times of relative stability. When things go booming up fast, maybe that's not actually the best for Veeva. And when things downturn a bit, maybe that's not all the best for Veeva either. We operate the best when things are pretty stable.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC Capital Markets.\nRishi Jaluria: I wanted to ask 1 CRM question and 1 non-CRM question to balance things out. So on the CRM side, maybe I want to ask a little bit more explicitly, right? So the non-compete goes away in 2025. Salesforce has obviously been vocal about wanting to get deeper in vertical software. They're obviously trying to find more avenues for growth now that the market continues to get saturated away. How should we think about the potential for over time sales force to actually become a competitor and start selling their solutions directly into life sciences, whether it's the out-of-the-box functionality or actually verticalizing the solution themselves. And then I've got a follow-up.\nPaul Shawah : Yes. Rishi, this is Paul. So yes, the way that -- first the way to think about the -- our partnership with Salesforce, a very long history of a really great partnership with Salesforce. And the agreement goes through 2025. And through 2025, what that means is we are Salesforce's preferred partner for the life sciences industry. So I don't expect that to change at all between, certainly between now and then. We can't comment on where Salesforce decides to invest, and how they decide to focus after that. So I don't see any change there. We do know that the life sciences space is -- it's a highly regulated, very specialized industry. It takes a lot of time to get it right. It's a complex space. We're the market leader here, and we expect to make the transition super easy for customers and continue to innovate here. So we can only focus on our horse and not on what others do.\nRishi Jaluria: Okay. That's totally fair. And then, Peter, in the prepared remarks, you talked about maybe some of the progress that you're making on the CDMS side with CROs I was wondering if you can expand on that, what you're seeing out of them? And maybe has there been any pushback from CROs to adopting the CDMS solution so far? What needs to happen for that to become a significant part of that business?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. CROs, we just get continued interest and momentum in the CROs. Now they're not -- they're going to be somewhat hesitant, somewhat not hesitant, but measured in their response. They have their policies and procedures that are set up the way they do things with their existing vendors. So change happens a little bit slowly there. But what is causing the momentum is more sponsors asking about Veeva, more sponsors asking about Veeva and then some of the CROs seeing proof in that it's actually more efficient to operate with Veeva. So I think it's just a slow gradual change. The CROs, in general, will tend to use the market-leading technology. I think Veeva is on its way to being the market-leading technology and and the CROs will come along with that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Wallace with Guggenheim Securities.\nJack Wallace: One more on the at Salesforce. Just trying to think about kind of why now to make the change in re-platforming to Vault. I think I understand the the reasons why the switch. But why now? Why not before the last contract resigning? And were there inflationary pressures going forward that you wanted to avoid and because the cost savings better and maybe a better platform in-house. Just thinking about the timing around the change in platforms.\nPeter Gassner: Yes. In terms of the timing, first, it's always good to make changes when things are good. The application is strong, the customer feeling is strong. So that's a good time to make a change. Also, if you look at why now versus 5 years ago or 4 years ago, the Vault platform is very mature now, very robust now. And we have safety going and we have CDMS going. Maybe 4 years ago, maybe the Vault platform maybe you couldn't have done that because maybe it wasn't quite mature enough and also it had safety in CDMS really stressing it out about 4 years ago. So I think that would have been too early. And why now is why not wait? I guess that's the other question. It's the right time. It gives our customers plenty of time to move, plenty of heads up. Vault platform is clearly ready and it's just timing. We can have a better customer experience and a better application. The bulk of our application revenue now, as you saw from the Analyst Day, is on the Vault platform, and its own -- that percentage is only increasing. So it's time to bring CRM in the fold. It will be better for Veeva and our customers. It's just the right timing.\nJack Wallace: Got it. That's helpful. And then, Brent, this one is for you. The R&D list, it sounds like that's ongoing and will continue through next year and probably '25, you support the migration. Just thinking about the context of that spend relative to the '25 targets. I say next year is going to be a little bit of an odd year with the revenue cadence on the TFC changes. But thinking about the percentage of revenue targets there, is that 17% to 18%, still a good target for the '25 period?\nBrent Bowman: So yes, we're not going to provide future guidance right now, but we're happy with the momentum and the execution, as Peter mentioned, growing at 18%. And we have our 2025 targets out there. tracking about a year ahead. And remember, that's a run rate target. So we're on track for that about a year ahead, and we're pleased with the broad portfolio we have to execute against.\nOperator: Your next question comes again from the line of Ken Wong with Oppenheimer.\nKen Wong : Lots of stuff spinning in my head right now. So maybe just back on the Vault CRM, would just love a sense of like any thoughts on how this could potentially impact pricing? Would that possibly change? And then second, just one for Brent on the impact of kind of the TFC that you called out at Investor Day, is that something that should hit at the start of the year for fiscal '24? What's the right way to think about when we should start rolling that impact in?\nPaul Shawah : Ken, this is Paul. Yes, I'll take the question on pricing. So the way to think about it is the licensing model and the pricing will all stay the same and all of the same add-ons that we have will also be available with Vault CRM. So nothing really changes there. It will be pretty seamless and easy for our customers.\nBrent Bowman: And then on the termination for convenience, Ken. So yes, the $60 million is effective February 1 going forward. And how you should think about that is about 60% of that, we expect to have an impact Q1 of next year. And with the balance of that kind of diminishing over the balance of the year. And one other point there is it's -- the vast majority will be on the R&D Solutions side of the business. So it's going well. We're working with customers and we're on track.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America.\nBrad Sills : I wanted to ask about the new hires. You mentioned 483 new hires this quarter. Just curious where are the areas where you're focusing on new hires from a product standpoint and R&D versus sales and marketing, please?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. I believe that was 483 net additions in the quarter. It's really broad-based. It's is true, right? If you look at our account executives, our account partners, it's there. It's in our engineering, our product management, our services team, our support team I think the area where the growth is a bit lower in the G&A. We have a pretty efficient model there. So it's customer-facing and product-facing people is where the growth is.\nBrad Sills : One more, if I may, please. Outside life sciences verticals, not something you've talked about a whole lot here at the Analyst Day and here, just any update on where you are with those verticals? And is -- could that be an increasing focus going forward, or are you still very much in that kind of early reference selling approach?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, our main focus is in the pharma and biotech. That's where our product portfolio is the broadest. That's where we have the bulk of our revenue. We're doing well in the consumer products area. I think we just passed 100 customers, which is a sort of a milestone I noticed on the sheet there. So it continues to grow and that customer reference model is pretty strong there. Our product footprint is just smaller in that segment. And MedTech is growing well as well, the MedTech R&D side. It's just by sciences is bigger for us and our product footprint is broader.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: I joined the call late, so apologies if some of these questions were asked. But maybe I'll start with the Merck deal. Congrats on that, by the way. It feels like one of those all-in Veeva deals that we were talking about at the beginning of this fiscal year. I guess the question is, how is the pipeline of those types of opportunities? I mean, clearly, not to the extent of Merck, right? But these types of all-in consolidation deals. Can you just talk about that pipeline, and how you're thinking about it?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, I'll take that one. Merck was not a deal but a strategic partnership over the long term. And we have strategic partnerships with many customers, none quite to the level of structure that we achieved with Merck. We may get some more of those, but those are there's none of those -- I can tell that there's none of those imminent right now, but we may get to more of those over time. And it's just a way to formalize our strategic partnership. They'll happen -- those will happen when they happen. And you shouldn't think of them as deals or product bundles. They're really partnership agreements. So that in Merck's case, it was so it made it easier to evaluate, consume and operate and purchase the Veeva products, just make it simpler for everybody the idea to say we're going with Veeva, when we need to make change and Veeva has a product we go with Veeva, that is what we do. And it makes it very efficient and pleasurable to work on in an environment like that.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. Got it. That makes sense. Maybe I'll direct the next question to Paul. I understand the CRM might have been beat to death, but maybe the question I have here is with the switching platform, is there any sort of joint IT or anything that will go away? Or is there anything that -- and of course, the time frame for one of the way I understand is very long, but just thinking about this, is there anything that will change with the look and feel with Vault as the back end. I'm just curious whether the customer will see anything different with the change in platform.\nPaul Shawah : Yes. So on the first one with regards to , it's pretty clear where there's IP in the platform that what Salesforce has, and there's IP in the application, and that's Veeva. So there's a pretty clear line there. So I wouldn't think about it as kind of anything kind of that's joint or going away that's combined. Regarding change in look and feel Part of our strategy is to migrate just the back end and to keep the front end as similar as possible. So that will make it much easier for our customers to make that transition. It will do things like limit retraining. The front-end experience is working for our customers.  There's a reason why much of the industry is using it. So we're not focused on changing a lot of that. Now having said that, this does give us an opportunity over time to make some changes and deliver a better application. So it's kind of that balance. We'll keep things very familiar and are common in the short term. And then over time, it will give us a platform to further innovate on.\nOperator: We are showing no more questions in the queue. I'll turn the call back over to Veeva management for closing remarks.\nPeter Gassner : All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today, and thank you to our customers for your continued partnership and to the Veeva team for your outstanding work in the quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brent Bowman",
            "content": "Yes. Overall, yes, we're happy with R&D Solutions growing at about 18%, adjusted for FX on a full year basis. The little bit of reduction you're seeing is a combination of 2 things. One is the FX incremental as well as a little bit of deal timing. So the 2 things, what drove a little bit of reduction. If you look out to our 2025 targets. We don't expect there to be a material impact. We're still tracking about a year ahead inclusive of this new announcement. We don't anticipate there to be any real significant investments required. We're going to largely leverage our internal resources and also the power of our Vault platform. Beyond 2025, that's a long time out there. Yes, there is some accounts payable. You can see in our quarterly financials. That's a monthly number. So you can use that as a ballpark estimate. Yes. So really happy with the momentum. Those few deals we talked about in Q2 did close in Q3. So we're very pleased about that. So overall, from a macro perspective, we've seen kind of similar to what we said 90 days ago, not better, not worse. And that's basically a little bit of additional scrutiny that we saw 90 days ago, but nothing significantly different than that. Yes. Regarding Q4, it's always our seasonally lower operating margin quarter. Why is that? Service Services utilization with the holidays is always a factor as well as kind of the reset on benefits and payroll tax type items. So that's a big seasonal reduction you will see. And then we're continuing to invest for long-term growth. Those are the two factors, but nothing else unusual. Yes. I mean part of it, Joe, you're right. There always is some quarterization. So that's why we always say kind of look at it on a full year basis. Q3 benefited about $6 million. I just more annual billers that would have otherwise likely build in Q4. So that's part of the equation. But it's just a little bit of timing of renewals in those annual billers. So there's nothing fundamental to the business. We're very, very happy with the momentum, as Peter mentioned, around the clinical space in the EDC space. So really good business momentum and no underlying business concerns around the billings. So yes, we're not going to provide future guidance right now, but we're happy with the momentum and the execution, as Peter mentioned, growing at 18%. And we have our 2025 targets out there. tracking about a year ahead. And remember, that's a run rate target. So we're on track for that about a year ahead, and we're pleased with the broad portfolio we have to execute against. And then on the termination for convenience, Ken. So yes, the $60 million is effective February 1 going forward. And how you should think about that is about 60% of that, we expect to have an impact Q1 of next year. And with the balance of that kind of diminishing over the balance of the year. And one other point there is it's -- the vast majority will be on the R&D Solutions side of the business. So it's going well. We're working with customers and we're on track."

            "content": "Thank you, Ato, and welcome everyone to the call. We had a strong Q3, delivering results ahead of our guidance. Total revenue in the quarter was $552 million, up 16% year-over-year, and subscription revenue was up 16% to $442 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $219 million or 40% of total revenue. Despite the difficult macro environment, we continue to execute well. Our innovation engine is strong and our strategic partnerships with the industry are increasing. We also had a record hiring quarter and a very strong quarter in clinical with some significant wins. We also announced that we are moving Veeva CRM to the Veeva Vault platform over time. This will allow us to deliver a better application and a better customer experience. At this point, we'll open up the call to your questions. Yes, Ken, it is the contract goes until 2025. So that's where we're not competing together in the market there. That's according to the contract. And then there's a wind down period for existing customers that starts in 2025, and that goes to 2030. So it's business as usual. There's nothing could change about today and the customers are supported with Veeva CRM until 2030. We expect to have early adopters on the Vault CRM in 2024, some early adopters, and then the majority moving on 2025 or so, that's when we'll be selling mainly well CRM and customers will migrate over time. They have plenty of time. So that's the basic of how to think about it, Ken. Yes. So in the clinical, it's right that those are two very significant wins in the quarter. Two top 20s that selected our EDC. That's a very, very core application at the heart of the clinical data management and then there are more applications that we are bringing out and have bought out the RTSM, randomization and trial supply management, patient-reported outcomes, our CDB product. So that's -- when you look at clinical operations, us getting eTMF in there early with a sign of very good things to come. And us getting EDC in at these large companies, that's a sign of very good things to come in clinical data management. And then, you're right, that's we read into broader future for us in clinical as we connect up the clinical research sites, and there's many, many applications we can make on top of this as we connect. So clinical, I'm super excited about we're in the very, very early days of clinical, especially the clinical data management area. Yes, it's a great hiring environment. People are looking for quality companies, stable companies doing great work, where they can feel aligned to the values and do their best work. the shiny penny of the crazy start-up idea is not so shiny anymore. So it's a great hiring environment. We'll really invest across all areas of the business: sales, services and specialty product but you're not going to see anything dramatic from Veeva. You'll see the measured pace that we go at. We really focus on the quality hiring. We've often come in under our hiring targets. And if this grade environment continues, we -- hopefully, we won't come in under our hiring targets anymore. So I'm really pleased about that. That's a leading indicator of for Veeva when we can hire great people. Yes, Ann, this is Peter. MedTech CRM and the Pharma CRM, they share a common foundation. You have to do those things together. So with moving need the CRM to the Vault platform. We really had to prioritize Pharma CRM first, take care of our existing customers, get that base set up. And then, yes, MedTech CRM that may come later, but we needed to prioritize the sequence since these applications are tightly interrelated. Yes. Certainly, the overall, a little bit of caution in the advertising spend as far as when that would turn around or stay the same or get worse, I really don't have a crystal ball on that. What our focus on that project is just increasing the value from the application. So increasing functionality, increased integration with our other CRM products -- CRM-related products and moving to more multiyear agreements, enterprise license agreements with customers to provide a baseline of revenue and stability and service for the customers. So really excited about the Crossix business. I think we have a clear road map, and it's going quite well. So when it looks like really we're you could think about as moving the back end of the application, the back-end platform, and we'll have migration tools that will bring the data across, including the customers customization and still be able to use all their content that they've developed, their multichannel e-mail templates. And we'll use the same front-end applications such as on the iPad. So that's what it will look like. We'll develop a lot of tooling. The customer will have integrations to ride, things like that. And in terms of competitive it's only out there, right? It's always a competitive market, whether you're moving platforms or not, and you have to continue to mind your customer relationships, continue to add value and innovation.  So I don't really see anything different there. And the main thing is we're replatforming the application CRM. We're not rewriting it. We're not introducing any kind of a new paradigm. So I feel comfortable that the vast majority of customers will migrate over time. And I guess the other thing is that the Veeva Vault platform is a very mature application. The bulk of Veeva's revenue is on the Veeva Vault application, and that's where our customers actually have the majority of their Veeva business for most of them is on the Veeva Vault platform. So I think overall for customers, this is a positive that simplifies their landscape. So no change in customer behavior, Joe. And I would say, yes, primarily, our customers are concerned with the excellence of the application in their area. But as they get more Veeva applications and more Vault applications, they do look for synergies there, synergies in -- they might create a Veeva Vault center of excellence, that type of thing for efficient operations. Or they may be auditing the Vault platform, and it's easier just to audit on platform. So we see that there. And then the connectivity between the applications, between R&D and commercial, specifically, between clinical, medical and commercial, that's something we do see opportunity there. And I think Veeva will help drive that. Some customers are asking for that. But I think mainly, we're going to be leading the way there. And you really haven't had great solutions for that connectivity, and I think we'll bring innovation there and connectivity that will create the market there. Excellent question there. I guess to step back, where we have a safety application that's a very complex applications. It's case processing of what's called adverse events, somebody takes a medicine and they either have a bad reaction or they think they have a bad reaction and then has to be classified and routed and recorded to health authorities, et cetera, around the world. So it's a very complex application. We're really the first company able to do that as a cloud-native application. That means just like we do everything else, there's one version of the code and all customers run it. So that's a breakthrough. Our customers are used to on-premise applications, they have to upgrade lots of issues. Now that this customer is live. This is the top 20, one of the larger top 20 customers.  Now there's proof that, that works. And I think, I wouldn't say all the way, but mainly customers are thinking, I probably will go with Veeva for safety. And then the question is when, is it next year? Is it 3 years from now, 5 years from now, 7 years from now? So that's really the significance of it. Now we have, of course, the work's never done. I'll never be satisfied with our safety application side. It always has to get better and better and better. But it was a very significant milestone, for the industry and for Veeva. And also just the other thing I'd add, the speed that, that implementation happened, I won't quote the exact numbers of days, was probably about half the time that most customers would have expected that it would have taken. So that was also seriously noticed by the industry. Can you tell that I'm enthused about that? In terms of Merck, I won't get into any details specifically there on Merck. I would say that in a strategic agreement of that nature, generally, we're not talking at the platform level there. We're more talking about operating model, how we operate together, how we -- the governance model and it's only done based on trust over many years when they see repeated patterns of a customer success orientation of a strategic partnership orientation, and then it's really the governance model that we put in. So it would be at a higher level versus individual products or platforms. Yes, these were wins with top 20 customers. And they were -- yes, they have to be displacing one of the market leaders because people do need an EDC application. And so in both cases, we're displacing one of the top 2 market leaders there other than Veeva. And then in terms of the deal sizes, I won't specifically say in that area, but EDC is one of our larger applications. So it would be one of our -- these are larger deals. They're certainly some of our largest deals. Now these will ramp over multiple years because with the EDC application, you start study by study by study. So it's a commitment for a long-term approach, but the revenue ramps very slowly, actually, slower than most of our applications, that's the way that goes.  So right now, our -- we are progressing faster with EDC than I would have thought. If you would have asked me in '20 -- in the start of 2020, would we be where we are today with EDC, I probably wouldn't have been as bullish as what's actually happened. So our focus is going to be extremely on the customer success there because the EDC also is the -- it's the first part of clinical data management. So that's that's we're focused on. We're really happy with it, and we're going to be laser-focused on having implementations just be outstanding and improving our product through the feedback of these large customers. We have to do a lot of things there, right? Customer success, staffing and services. It's a great work to do, but we got to get better all the time. Yes. At Compass, that's certainly a marathon. That's a tough market. You have a very entrenched player there that has some questionable business practices that make it hard. We're happy with our progress on the product, and we have a smallish set of early adopters. I won't go into the specific count of customers. As to when we really start to generate momentum in the revenue, it's going to be low. It's not going to be next year. It's a very long-term play. I'm confident in our position in the market and our product strategy. I'm confident that the market needs competition. But that one is going to be a marathon, and you just have to stay tuned for milestones. That's the thing about great milestones. You don't actually know when they're coming, but we'll let you know when they get here. Yes. Stephanie, I'll take that one. The main thing to know is that when we build applications on Vault, we're highly efficient. We're highly efficient on that. So there's a lot of work that has gone into the platform. So we don't see really material incremental investment. And then we're using much of the parts of the CRM application. We're just porting over the back end. So for example, we have a very robust iPad client for Veeva CRM. It has all types of functionality into it. We're not going to rewrite that application at all. So that's why the investment is just -- it's not material to the rest of Veeva, it's because of the leverage, both in the existing application footprint, template and code and then the leverage we get from the Vault platform. Yes. Excellent question. In general, we're going to re-platform the back end. So we're not going to change up the user experience or do dramatic things at that time. Now having said that, we have an existing road map for CRM that's been -- we've really been executing on. So our customers have a lot of new functionality for example, engage new features that we have engaged, engage Connect that allows compliant messaging between doctors and sales reps. That's just starting to get adopted now. because that's a thing that needs compliance oversight. That's going to continue right into Vault CRM. So I would think of it as re-platforming the back end and reinvigorating the front end and the functionality that just keeps going on. That's been going on for a while, and that will continue on. Yes. There's a lot of ways to think about that one. I will start with last year and the year before, it's been quite unusual, right? We haven't seen the interest rate rise this far or this high since the early '80s and the same with inflation going up this high and raise this fact into early '80s and a war in Europe like this, I haven't seen in my lifetime. So these are unusual times.  Having said that, what makes Veeva -- the factors that are going in Veeva's favor, first, I would say our customer feeling, our customer success viewing and track record of success that we've built up over time. That is a tremendous insulator in downturn -- in downtimes. Also the nature of the industry, the industry when it's not recession-proof, but very recession resistant. This is not like our airlines or hotels or luxury items, things like that, restaurants. People need their medicine in good times and bad. Medicine is a critical part of health care without medicines, health care costs go up, et cetera. So the spending doesn't change too much.  The segment where it is affected a little bit is in smaller private companies that if the funding environment goes down, they can't get as much funding. They have to be more conservative with their expansions. And then I would say the last thing is the type of products we do. They are mission-critical systems of record. Good times are bad. You need your clinical trial management system. Just like you need your financial system and you need your ERP system.  What you may not need is the speculative piece of technology or add on, on the top of that. That's maybe what you don't need. And we focus really on system of records. So we have that going in favor for us. So I think a lot of things going in our favor for stability. We do best in times of relative stability. When things go booming up fast, maybe that's not actually the best for Veeva. And when things downturn a bit, maybe that's not all the best for Veeva either. We operate the best when things are pretty stable. Yes. CROs, we just get continued interest and momentum in the CROs. Now they're not -- they're going to be somewhat hesitant, somewhat not hesitant, but measured in their response. They have their policies and procedures that are set up the way they do things with their existing vendors. So change happens a little bit slowly there. But what is causing the momentum is more sponsors asking about Veeva, more sponsors asking about Veeva and then some of the CROs seeing proof in that it's actually more efficient to operate with Veeva. So I think it's just a slow gradual change. The CROs, in general, will tend to use the market-leading technology. I think Veeva is on its way to being the market-leading technology and and the CROs will come along with that. Yes. In terms of the timing, first, it's always good to make changes when things are good. The application is strong, the customer feeling is strong. So that's a good time to make a change. Also, if you look at why now versus 5 years ago or 4 years ago, the Vault platform is very mature now, very robust now. And we have safety going and we have CDMS going. Maybe 4 years ago, maybe the Vault platform maybe you couldn't have done that because maybe it wasn't quite mature enough and also it had safety in CDMS really stressing it out about 4 years ago. So I think that would have been too early. And why now is why not wait? I guess that's the other question. It's the right time. It gives our customers plenty of time to move, plenty of heads up. Vault platform is clearly ready and it's just timing. We can have a better customer experience and a better application. The bulk of our application revenue now, as you saw from the Analyst Day, is on the Vault platform, and its own -- that percentage is only increasing. So it's time to bring CRM in the fold. It will be better for Veeva and our customers. It's just the right timing. Yes. I believe that was 483 net additions in the quarter. It's really broad-based. It's is true, right? If you look at our account executives, our account partners, it's there. It's in our engineering, our product management, our services team, our support team I think the area where the growth is a bit lower in the G&A. We have a pretty efficient model there. So it's customer-facing and product-facing people is where the growth is. Yes, our main focus is in the pharma and biotech. That's where our product portfolio is the broadest. That's where we have the bulk of our revenue. We're doing well in the consumer products area. I think we just passed 100 customers, which is a sort of a milestone I noticed on the sheet there. So it continues to grow and that customer reference model is pretty strong there. Our product footprint is just smaller in that segment. And MedTech is growing well as well, the MedTech R&D side. It's just by sciences is bigger for us and our product footprint is broader. Yes, I'll take that one. Merck was not a deal but a strategic partnership over the long term. And we have strategic partnerships with many customers, none quite to the level of structure that we achieved with Merck. We may get some more of those, but those are there's none of those -- I can tell that there's none of those imminent right now, but we may get to more of those over time. And it's just a way to formalize our strategic partnership. They'll happen -- those will happen when they happen. And you shouldn't think of them as deals or product bundles. They're really partnership agreements. So that in Merck's case, it was so it made it easier to evaluate, consume and operate and purchase the Veeva products, just make it simpler for everybody the idea to say we're going with Veeva, when we need to make change and Veeva has a product we go with Veeva, that is what we do. And it makes it very efficient and pleasurable to work on in an environment like that. All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today, and thank you to our customers for your continued partnership and to the Veeva team for your outstanding work in the quarter. Thank you."

            "name": "Paul Shawah",
            "content": "Yes. The others are pretty similar to what we've seen over the last couple of quarters. I think in we were talking to you back in June, we highlighted a little bit of a slowdown in the SMB space that particularly the lower end fewer expansions, not getting any -- not improving significantly or not worsening either. So really haven't seen much of a change there. Yes. No significant change on the budget side. Our customers have gone through that timing process, and we haven't really seen any pricing pressures. When you think about the industry, particularly in the large enterprise, they're not -- it's not as susceptible to some of these macroeconomic changes, and we haven't seen any change there. You had a second question, which was around the inflation increase that we've had. And by and large, we haven't seen any -- it really has been pretty seamless with our customers. And the reason is we built that have a long history of being a trusted partner. We haven't historically had any license pricing increases. So our customers know this is a different environment. And by and large, it hasn't been an issue. Yes. Rishi, this is Paul. So yes, the way that -- first the way to think about the -- our partnership with Salesforce, a very long history of a really great partnership with Salesforce. And the agreement goes through 2025. And through 2025, what that means is we are Salesforce's preferred partner for the life sciences industry. So I don't expect that to change at all between, certainly between now and then. We can't comment on where Salesforce decides to invest, and how they decide to focus after that. So I don't see any change there. We do know that the life sciences space is -- it's a highly regulated, very specialized industry. It takes a lot of time to get it right. It's a complex space. We're the market leader here, and we expect to make the transition super easy for customers and continue to innovate here. So we can only focus on our horse and not on what others do. Ken, this is Paul. Yes, I'll take the question on pricing. So the way to think about it is the licensing model and the pricing will all stay the same and all of the same add-ons that we have will also be available with Vault CRM. So nothing really changes there. It will be pretty seamless and easy for our customers. Yes. So on the first one with regards to , it's pretty clear where there's IP in the platform that what Salesforce has, and there's IP in the application, and that's Veeva. So there's a pretty clear line there. So I wouldn't think about it as kind of anything kind of that's joint or going away that's combined. Regarding change in look and feel Part of our strategy is to migrate just the back end and to keep the front end as similar as possible. So that will make it much easier for our customers to make that transition. It will do things like limit retraining. The front-end experience is working for our customers.  There's a reason why much of the industry is using it. So we're not focused on changing a lot of that. Now having said that, this does give us an opportunity over time to make some changes and deliver a better application. So it's kind of that balance. We'll keep things very familiar and are common in the short term. And then over time, it will give us a platform to further innovate on."

Ato Garrett, Senior Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nAto Garrett: Good afternoon and welcome to Veeva\u2019s fiscal 2023 second quarter earnings conference call for the quarter ended July 31, 2022. As a reminder, we have posted prepared remarks on Veeva\u2019s Investor Relations website just after 1:00 p.m. Pacific today. We hope you have had a chance to read them before the call. Today\u2019s call will be used primarily for Q&A. With me today for Q&A are Peter Gassner, our Chief Executive Officer; Paul Shawah, EVP Commercial Strategy; and Brent Bowman, our Chief Financial Officer. During the call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding trends, our strategies and the anticipated performance of the business, including guidance regarding future financial results. These forward-looking statements will be based on our current views and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the risks listed in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our most recent filing on Form 10-Q. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today, August 31, 2022 based on the facts available to us today. If this call is replayed or viewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Veeva disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We may discuss our guidance on today\u2019s call, but we will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. On the call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aids in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today\u2019s earnings release and in the supplemental investor presentation both of which are available on our website. With that, thank you for joining us. And I will turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you, Ato and welcome everyone to the call. We had a solid Q2 with revenue ahead of our guidance and operating income at our guidance. Total revenue was $534 million, up 17% year-over-year and subscription revenue was up 17% to $429 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $202 million or 38%. We have revised our full year revenue guidance down by about 1.5% at the top end from $2.175 billion to $2.145 billion due to foreign currency and macroeconomic factors. We executed well in the quarter. Hiring was good, our innovation engine is working well and our customer relationships continue to get stronger as we have more solutions to offer and each of our solutions gets better. Our competitive landscape and product strategy also have never been stronger. We continue to track ahead of our goal to cross $3 billion in revenue in 2025 and have planted seeds for a long runway of growth well into the future. We will now open up the call to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Kenneth Wong with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nKenneth Wong: Fantastic. Thanks for taking my questions. I have got one for Peter and then a follow-up for Brent. Peter, you mentioned drug pricing legislation in your prepared remarks and I realize it\u2019s a while away, but would just love to get your take on maybe where that could impact the industry? Is it more on the commercial side where maybe pricing causes more headcount reductions or is it on the clinical side or perhaps the opportunity looks less attractive and we see less investments in that area, would love to get your take on that?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. On the drug pricing, first, to put it in perspective, this is specific to the U.S. and that\u2019s a big part of life sciences, but certainly not the whole part of it. And then it has to do with Medicaid, which is roughly about half of the U.S., it doesn\u2019t have to do with private insurance. And it\u2019s about the top X drugs and it gets implemented in 2026. So it\u2019s too early to say how it plays out over the long-term. In the short and medium-term, it\u2019s steady as she goes. There is no changes and we just have to see how this works out over the long-term. And you had a follow-up question for Paul as well?\nKenneth Wong: No, follow-up for Brent. Brent, when I look at the guidance, I guess I just wanted to get a sense for kind of what you mentioned headwinds in the pipeline in June. How did that look exiting July? Did that stabilize? And then when thinking about the guidance, are you assuming that it worsens or kind of stays at the current levels?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. So thanks, Ken. So yes, in June, we started to see some of the macro factors of plan and that continued in July at a similar pace. If you take a step back from a revenue guide perspective, we are growing revenue 18% after normalizing for FX. So we are pretty happy about that.  And if you unpack the reduction, about half of the reduction is related to FX as the dollar continued to strengthen over the last 90 days. The other half relates to the overall macro dynamics. Specifically, it\u2019s impacting commercial a bit more. We have seen some impact to Crossix as advertising budgets have tightened a bit. And we have also saw little bit of lower add-on users from SMB customers in the CRM and Vault Commercial. But I want to point out that R&D has not really been impacted by the macro. Most of the R&D products are \u2013 they are not priced on a per unit basis per user, they are priced more on the enterprise agreement, so really no long-term change in the overall business or the competitive environment. What we have seen in the change in our guidance reflects specific FX impact and macro environment.\nKenneth Wong: Got it. Perfect. Thank you for the color.\nBrent Bowman: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about one on just some of the activity you saw this quarter and then another one on the macro, please. Maybe just to start, in quality, in particular, it stands out 52 wins this quarter and it sounds like R&D is holding strong despite the macro. What would you say the footprint looks like for those initial wins? Are they starting small and this could potentially lead to some bigger up-sell deals down the road? Is it kind of quality first wins, if you will, that could potentially lead to bigger add-on deals?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, I will take that one. It\u2019s really provide in the quality area across those customers. So big picture, what\u2019s happening is we picked a good product strategy number of years ago to have a suite of quality products all on a common platform. So QualityDocs, QMS, training and now we have introduced LIM, laboratory information management. We have announced that. So we are really the only company that has that integrated suite of products. And then we have a good account coverage as well and we are just executing. So yes, it starts \u2013 it can be a small biotech that the only thing they need from us at the very beginning might be quality or it can be a new customer that\u2019s an established customer that just happens to be starting in one of our product areas in quality and then they are going to add multiple product areas in quality or it could be a customer where quality is the first area and that\u2019s going to lead into clinical and regulatory and others. So I would say it\u2019s even mix across all three and it goes across segments, enterprise, SMB, pre-commercial goes over into med tech as well.\nBrad Sills: That\u2019s great. Thanks Peter. And then Brent, one for you if I may, please. Just on the guide for billings, 9% growth, it looks like for Q3, a pretty meaningful deceleration. Could you just help us unpack currency versus macro in there? And then just within the macro, it sounds like you are not assuming or you haven\u2019t seen R&D impacted here as more commercial side. Is that what you are assuming kind of in your guidance going forward? Thank you.\nBrent Bowman: Yes. I don\u2019t recognize the 9%. I can talk to the numbers that we have. I believe on a constant currency basis, we are guiding closer to 17% for billings in Q3. But what we are seeing is that the billings the reduction in the second half has really been a factor of two things. One is FX, similar to revenue as well as the macro. On the billings side, about a third is related to FX, again, to the strengthening dollar. And then the balance is related to predominantly commercial again. So, we talked about the Crossix piece a second ago and some lighter in uptick in the number of user add-ons. R&D remains strong. So we are happy overall with the strength of the business and guiding 18% billings on an adjusted for FX and billing term changes.\nBrad Sills: Thanks so much, Brent.\nBrent Bowman: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Thanks so much for taking my question. First, I wanted to start out by just better understanding kind of some of the puts and takes of the guidance in the back half of the year, because if we take guidance at face value right now, be it billings or subscription revenue, the idea of reacceleration in the back half of the year seems to be off the table for now. Is that the right way to think about it longer term or is there still kind of a scenario where we can see overall subscription growth reaccelerate above 20%? I am not asking for guidance for next year. I know you will provide that next quarter. But maybe just how we should be thinking about the potential for reacceleration? And then I have got a follow-up.\nBrent Bowman: Yes. So FX, we see it definitely had an impact. We called out slight acceleration expectation on revenue in the prior guide and that has been challenged by the FX and the macro. The underlying business remains as strong as we thought 90 days ago. So that is unchanged at the competitive environment. It\u2019s in our favor as strong as ever. So I would think about it that way and also think about the opportunity ahead. We are still early, early days in a broad opportunity across R&D as we are the operating system for DevCloud. And then in commercial, we have a lot of opportunities as well if you think about Data Cloud and Link and the like. So lot of growth opportunities in front of us.\nRishi Jaluria: Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe I just wanted to think about \u2013 in the prepared remarks, you called out maybe some headwinds on the SMB side. I guess I am a little surprised to kind of see that just given how big your customers and how big their spending with you is, can you maybe help us understand directionally, how much of your business is what you would call SMB and how you are defining that? Just so we can kind of better understand the model going forward, especially in this macro? Thank you.\nBrent Bowman: Yes, sure, happy to. Maybe good to kind of take a step back. So first off, I know pharma represents about 90% of Veeva\u2019s overall revenue with the balance being med tech and CPMC. And we think enterprise customers represent roughly 60% of our total pharma revenue and we define enterprise as the top 50 or so largest pharma companies. So the balance of that is SMB, which is roughly 40% of the total pharma and this is made up of wide range of different customer types. We have small 100-person startup company all the way to $1 billion of revenue. So that\u2019s how we are defining it and pre-commercial is a small percentage of that.\nRishi Jaluria: Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you.\nBrent Bowman: You bet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is open.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Brent, maybe just to start out with you, can we just talk a little bit about how the all-in Veeva deals are playing into this guide? In earlier quarters, I know those were obviously very big and very complicated deals that take a while. Are we assuming longer sales cycles for those or lower sizes, just curious if you can tie those two things, the all-in Veeva deals and the billings adjustment for the year?\nBrent Bowman: Yes, no, happy to. So what we have seen is some increased deal scrutiny. So \u2013 and that\u2019s on a deal-by-deal basis that could impact various sizes of deals. So, that\u2019s playing into the \u2013 our guide for the year. And I think you are referring to a large deal we booked back in Q1. So yes, I wouldn\u2019t say there is anything significant change in large deals other than some general additional deal scrutiny.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. Got it. That\u2019s helpful, Peter. Maybe for my follow-up for you, I was wondering if you could just dig into the Crossix business a little bit more, I mean remind us kind of what are the bigger offerings there and sort of what\u2019s changed in sort of this downtick in the macro, if you will?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. Crossix has a few different parts to it. It\u2019s all related to advertising. Some of it is measurement, how are your advertising going and some of it is more programmatic, which is you can buy audience for us \u2013 from us, patient audiences. So there is a lot of details to the Crossix offering. But at the macro level, due to the macro environment, people spend a little bit less in advertising and so that flows through to Crossix. I would say we are real bullish on Crossix going forward. When we bought it about 3 years ago, the idea was to use it to develop data cloud, but also to integrate CRM and Crossix so we can help the industry bring together sales and marketing. And that\u2019s really playing out. So we are increasing our revenue in Crossix overall, and we\u2019re making it a broader offering and even establishing a new type of pattern with some customers where certain percentage of Crossix is done as an enterprise agreement, a baseline measurement agreement. Therefore, it will be a little less variable as we go forward. But these changes take a while to play out over time.\nSaket Kalia: Makes sense. Thanks, guys.\nPeter Gassner: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question. I have one guidance question and one more product question. On the guidance side of the equation, I mean, overall excess billings coming down by $35 million on a $2.3 billion base isn\u2019t huge, it\u2019s not a very big impact. And the question I\u2019ve been getting more from investors isn\u2019t why are they taking numbers down? It\u2019s like are they taking numbers down far enough? Is the forecast conservative enough? So maybe for Brent, I was hoping you could help us garner confidence that this is the right cut that no more is going to be necessary on a go-forward basis and give us some confidence that the numbers have been de-risked on a go-forward basis. And then on the product side, I was wondering if you could dig into data cloud a little bit. And are there friction there that could potentially get taken away on a go-forward basis to sort of have that progress faster or does it just take time to sort of get through like the network effects that the existing income in that space have? Can you talk to us about like what can speed up or slow down progress with Data Cloud?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. So let me take that first one, Keith. Yes. So our \u2013 consistent with our guidance philosophy, we take all the best information to give you the best view we have of the business today. And we have a broad portfolio of customers and products. And so we have pretty good visibility into our pipes at various stages. And we have active conversations with our customers. So we have a sense of the pacing of what they are looking for. So we\u2019ve factored all that in. And we considered FX, the current rates they are at. We\u2019ve factored in that there is some increased deal scrutiny and also some lower spend in SMBs. So that was all informed our guidance here.\nPaul Shawah: Keith, I\u2019ll take the second part of your question around data cloud. So first, just defining that at the highest level, Data Cloud is Open Data, Link, and Compass. I think you may be referring to Compass, but let me hit each of them really quickly. Open Data is our customer reference data, state grower. That\u2019s been around for a while, Link. We announced that a number of years ago as one product, link for key people that has really great momentum, momentum in the enterprise and the SMB. We also announced four additional Link products which are getting \u2013 they are all in the very early stages with early adopters, but they are getting a lot of excitement because of the momentum we\u2019ve created with that first Link product. So Link family of applications, that\u2019s doing really well. And then the third area, which I think you may be referring to is driving additional speed is Compass. And Compass is \u2013 remember, that\u2019s our patient data, that\u2019s what we launched first and prescriber. And over time, we will have sales data in that area. We\u2019re really focused on the patient data side. Think about that Compass is really a marathon for us, right? We\u2019re in the very early stages with patient data. It\u2019s progressing well. We had four customer wins there. And the way to think about a customer win is they\u2019ll start with a brand and that brand will have a couple of use cases and they\u2019ll buy our data for those use cases. It could be something like defining the patient journey, understanding how to treat patients, it maybe finding more doctors based on the patients that they treat. That\u2019s what they would use it for. We have to deliver customer success in those areas. And then once we deliver on that, we will expand within that brand team, maybe additional products and then also across brands, selling new products to other brands in that company. So you can see it\u2019s kind of step-wise. It will take time for us. There is \u2013 we\u2019re accelerating in that space. We\u2019re highly focused on it. And we think all the time about things about how we can kind of further accelerate in there, and we\u2019re executing on most of those. So I am happy with the execution. It\u2019s going well, but that gives you a sense of what\u2019s in data cloud and all we feed on each other, right? All the products are connected together. So we are \u2013 we think we have the right product strategy and we are going to continue to execute there.\nKeith Weiss: Outstanding. Super helpful guys. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGabriela Borges: Hi, good afternoon. I have one for Peter or for Brent. I\u2019d love to revisit the trajectory of the core CRM business, the piece that\u2019s based on seat-based pricing. I know you\u2019ve been pretty consistent in saying that new customers seats will more than production. Could you remind us, do you think we\u2019re through the largest headwind of the production dynamic does returning [indiscernible] COVID help with this? How do we think about the trajectory of that specific piece of commercial going forward?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. So regarding the commerce space, so we still believe that 10% is the right number over time, we haven\u2019t seen anything that has changed that view. But we do expect to continue to take share. And as we take share that the impact of Veeva will in fact be less overall. We feel good about our ability to continue to expand the footprint of CRM as well as our add-on business associated with it.\nGabriela Borges: Thank you. The follow-up is on CDMS. A couple of comments in the prepared remarks. I know there was a customer win announced in the quarter as well. Would love to get a little more detail, how should we think about the trajectory of CDMS and is there a scenario where that becomes more significant or material driver of growth, either in the next 12 months or perhaps in the next 24 months?\nPeter Gassner: I\u2019ll take that one. CDMS. I would say, really happy with the progress in the quarter. And why do I say that? It\u2019s just the momentum, the \u2013 especially in the enterprise segment. The customer success with a couple of large enterprise customers we have and the progression of the sales cycle with some other enterprise customers gives me a lot of confidence. Our goal there is to be the leader in that area. Over time, and I think we will get there. Then that also leads into our digital trials, right? You have success in the core CDMS area. There are other products adjacent to CDMS which is the ePRO, patient-reported outcomes, that type of thing. The recently purchased randomization and trial supply management as well. So there is a lot of adjacent things. So we couldn\u2019t be happier with our progress and that one also. That one\u2019s like Compass. That one is a marathon, but we\u2019re ahead of the game. I think most people would say, Pete\u2019s going to win that race. It\u2019s too early to call that race for Compass because we\u2019re just getting started, so very different Compass in CDMS.\nGabriela Borges: Thanks for the comment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Dylan Becker with William Blair. Your line is open.\nDylan Becker: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe first for Peter, I think there was something in the prepared remarks relative to the growing number of customers with that vision for a unified platform. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s necessarily going to happen tonight. But obviously, you guys are heavily embedded in that strategic discussion. So maybe can you talk about the progression of that road map? What the future its option can look like? And how you can assign maybe some of the value with some of those earlier tools to support that broader platform standardization over time?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, it\u2019s a good question. So big picture, we\u2019re getting more products and each of the products are getting better, and we\u2019re fitting them together very nicely. And we saw that with Dev Cloud first, where we \u2013 a little, I guess, 6 years ago, 4 years ago, we started really painting this big picture. And now we\u2019re just executing on it, right, just executing. Commercial, we\u2019re doing that now as well. We made a lot of progress this year. So we have good, stable, happy customers in CRM and in commercial content, and we\u2019re leveraging that for success in these big new areas. Crossix, Data Cloud and actually our business consulting, which is our business consulting is going well. We started it 3 years ago. and it\u2019s quite profitable and has 150 people. So what we\u2019re seeing is our product strategy is right on the commercial side and on the R&D side, and we\u2019re executing well. I was really encouraged by this quarter because we just executed well, and the macro environment actually helps us for the long-term because during this time, there is a flight to quality with customers and with employees. So more rehires, more hires, getting more people, planting more seeds for future growth. Those things all last \u2013 they all ladder up to a more strategic relationship. When you have more excellent products, they fit together better, you just get more excellent relationships. And the macro, that happens. I\u2019ve seen that a lot. I saw the \u2013 I\u2019m one of those guys, right? I saw the dot-com boom and the dot-com bust. I even saw Y2K and that thing the financial crisis. And now we see COVID, right? COVID happened and then the overspending by governments, the inflation, the correction, the war in Ukraine, etcetera. But you get through these things, and it\u2019s really about it\u2019s just about execution. Do you have the right blueprint of what you\u2019re doing? Can you stay focused? Can you execute with excellence in the product and the field than you do okay? So that\u2019s why you hear optimism for me because I feel like to \u2013 we got a plan, and it\u2019s working.\nDylan Becker: Yes. And maybe if we could follow-up on that to a certain extent as well too, you highlighted a lot of kind of the ongoing innovation in a number of new product announcements and the strategic value of that business consulting segment maybe to the point. Now we\u2019re in it drives decisioning today, but relative to that the potential value capture. And maybe that\u2019s is in an area of growing incremental reliance on Veeva to say, hey, we want you to develop more of these kind of capabilities and solutions, obviously, to go out and capture more of the overall opportunity, but to continue to expand and develop that market, speaking to your point on the long-term maybe favorability from what you guys are seeing today as well.\nPeter Gassner: Yes, I agree with you. It\u2019s kind of business consulting is complete a picture for Veeva, strategic discussions about \u2013 with our customers how can they change their go-to-market motion. And that leads into both being able to introduce our products but also to influence our products, because we have a very tight relationship between our consulting group, our product group and our sales group. The feedback loop is very tight. And I don\u2019t know about every company in the world, that\u2019s for sure. But I don\u2019t know about any company that has this mix inside one company, and it\u2019s really feeling good.\nDylan Becker: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne: Yes. Thanks very much. One for Peter and one for Brent, I guess, Peter, just to start, you mentioned just a second ago that the macro actually might help you a little bit. I was just kind of curious on the R&D side. I know you haven\u2019t seen anything yet. But is there any chance of reprioritization around certain products may be moving up the priority list for your customers in a tougher environment versus where they might have been in a more normalized environment? I know it\u2019s sort of a hard thing to guess that. I was just kind of curious if you\u2019re seeing that perhaps at the top end of the funnel at all. And then Brent, just on your comments about small businesses are you referring specifically some of your smaller biotech customers? The reason I ask is I assume most of those are more R&D customers, not necessarily commercial customers. So I was just curious if you could clarify that a little bit? Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: Yes. The first question there, I guess, for sure, in this environment, it\u2019s not great to be selling nice-to-have products, right? Those are the first that get the downturn. And we don\u2019t have a lot of nice staff products. We have real foundational ones. So I would say things are looking good for us. The advertising, which is the Crossix related business that\u2019s required over the long-term, but you can modulate it up and down. So our product footprint is more about building \u2013 it\u2019s building capabilities for the long-term, not nice to have. It\u2019s susceptible a little bit here when you have these hiccups in the macro cause people to reassess a little bit, okay, what\u2019s going on. But where you really don\u2019t want to be is in nice-to-have products. That doesn\u2019t work well in this environment.\nKirk Materne: Just follow-up on that, I was actually referring to your product portfolio, meaning, I realize none of your products are going anywhere. They are all foundational. But I was wondering, even within your R&D product portfolio, are there things that might become more of an imperative in the short-term versus others. That might not be the case, but I was just curious.\nPeter Gassner: Yes. It\u2019s an excellent question. No, not really because they are all pretty foundational, and they are in their areas. If you\u2019re in safety, that\u2019s the most important thing to you. If you\u2019re in the clinical data management area, that\u2019s the most important thing to you. So there is no particular boost or slowdown in any particular area.\nBrent Bowman: And then, Kirk, to your second question, we did see it some of that \u2013 we talked about lower spending in SMBs, and that\u2019s more in the lower half of that SMB definition that I was describing before because that SMB space is a very wide space. But our pre-commercial exposure is really relatively small.\nKirk Materne: Thank you.\nPaul Shawah: I was just reflecting on your question, Kirk, and give you a bonus answer here. In terms of the products, it has more to do with just the natural cycles in the industry that \u2013 which run longer than the temporary macro. So, for example, some of the best progress we have had in the last year is actually in our regulatory in the upper end of the enterprise in the regulatory area. And that\u2019s just a function of us having good products and customer success in the industry, just it\u2019s a natural \u2013 we are approaching that second replacement cycle. So, it\u2019s more the natural rhythms rather than the macro.\nKirk Materne: Thank you, all.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi. Your line is open.\nTyler Radke: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you just in terms of the linearity in the quarter, kind of how that tracked and when you started to notice the slowdown in your pipeline? And then just a follow-up on Kirk\u2019s question, I guess if we look at your R&D guidance for the full year, it did come down slightly. I presume some of that was FX, but you also didn\u2019t take up the revenue guidance. So, I guess are there certain portions of the R&D portfolio that are seeing deal delays, perhaps CDMS where the deal sizes tend to be larger. Just help us understand the moving pieces there and any comments on linearity? Thank you.\nBrent Bowman: Yes. So, there are a few questions there. So, on linearity, we started to see some of the impact in the later part of June. So, that was where we started to see a little bit of the headwinds from a lower spend in SMBs and a little bit of additional deal scrutiny. So, the quarter started out a little bit more typical and then we started to see that later in the month of June. And then related to R&D, on a \u2013 if you exclude the impact of FX on a full year basis, it\u2019s closer to 32% growth full year. So, we are very pleased with what we are seeing from the momentum in the R&D space. Now, they are not completely immune either to additional deal scrutiny. So, if it\u2019s a large deal, there could be additional levels of approval and inspection on that. But we have not seen anything significant in the R&D space.\nTyler Radke: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ryan MacDonald with Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nRyan MacDonald: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe first, on the commercial side of the business, recently in some of the checks as we are thinking about budgets for calendar year \u201823 picked up that some budgets are starting to remain sort of static on a year-over-year basis for sales and marketing. Just curious if this is something that you \u2013 a phenomenon you are seeing as well? And perhaps how does that impact, how you are thinking about beyond the back half of the year and into next year, particularly in that commercial side of the business? Thanks.\nPaul Shawah: Yes. Hey Ryan, this is Paul. Can you just repeat the specific phenomenon? It kind of broke up when you said that. What are you seeing?\nRyan MacDonald: Yes. In some of our checks, we are starting to pick up that as we look at budget planning for sales and marketing heading into next year. The budgets are sort of remaining static rather than growing on a year-over-year basis. And so as we \u2013 to put that in the context of sort of the guidance \u2013 updated guidance today, how does \u2013 when are you seeing that? And two, what does that potentially say about the prolonging of any headwinds on the commercial side of the business? Thanks.\nPaul Shawah: Got it. Okay. Thanks Ryan. Thanks for repeating that. Yes, where most of the industry is entering their budget planning cycle right now, so those \u2013 a lot of those conversations are kind of hitting full swing in most life sciences companies. And no, I have not heard we are seeing that yet. It\u2019s just \u2013 again, like Peter talked about, a lot of what pharma does is these longer cycle, longer planning kinds of things, and we haven\u2019t seen any indication that budgets will be impacted next year. So, we haven\u2019t heard that yet, but time will tell.\nRyan MacDonald: Thanks. And maybe just a quick clarifying question on the SMB commentary. Are you seeing any churn at the SMB level, or is this more of a lack of expansion in spend at the SMB level? Thanks.\nPaul Shawah: Yes. It\u2019s mostly a lack of expansion. So, the add-on of additional CRM users, add-on of Chrome app users, there is always some level of churn that happens. You don\u2019t see it, but companies get acquired as one example. Our companies go out of business or they go up or they go down. That is very natural. It\u2019s very common. It happens every single quarter. That was not unusual in this quarter. It was more what Brent had referenced earlier.\nRyan MacDonald: Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jack Wallace with Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nJack Wallace: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. I got two of them for you. I realize we collectively hit the guidance question pretty hard here. I just want to use it from a different angle. Are there any geographic areas, maybe in particular, the Eurozone where decision-making is slowing more than others? And then I have got a follow-up.\nBrent Bowman: Yes. We are not seeing anything particular in a specific geo that it was worthy of calling out from an additional exposure perspective.\nJack Wallace: Got it. Thank you. And then be higher in the quarter, as you called out a couple of occasions that Veeva is a good place to work and potentially some of the smaller previously faster-growing public or private companies may not be as attractive to some of that talent, thinking about talent leaving and there being multiple compression, particularly in the private markets. Looking at your balance sheet, you have got nearly $3 billion in cash. Has the M&A pipeline picked up much? Are we getting closer potentially doing a couple of more deals just thinking about capital deployment? Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: Yes. I will take that one. Certainly, the hiring environment is better now than it was a year ago. In terms of M&A potential, yes, when the valuations come down, and the speculation comes off a little bit, it is a more attractive M&A environment and so we are looking, but we are always patient. We have a \u2013 so far, 100% track record of success on our acquisitions. That\u2019s hard to do. So, we are a bit careful and surgical, but we are looking. And when you are looking, you might find something, but you don\u2019t know exactly when you find it.\nJack Wallace: Thanks again.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joe Vruwink with Baird. Your line is open.\nJoe Vruwink: Hi. Great. Hi everyone. Just to peel back the onion a little bit more on commercial performance. The $17 million of lower subscription revenue guidance, most of that seems to be coming in the second half. If I specifically apply that to what I imagine the Crossix revenue basis, it implies a rather large change in Crossix performance. Is that directionally correct? And does it just speak to the extent of kind of ad budget changes that, that business is seeing?\nBrent Bowman: If you \u2013 if you take a look at the reduction, half of it is FX related. And then you can kind of split the other balance between Crossix, which you called out, there was a little bit more pronounced impact to the Crossix business and then the balance would be more broadly. So, I think your observation is a good one.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. Great. And then I know we have kind of asked this question a couple of different times. But based on your operating history and being through ebbs and flows in this industry, does it stand out to you that there is specific areas of your business. It seems like it\u2019s falling exclusively in commercial that are getting caught up in the macro where R&D is forging ahead 32% organic and the enterprise commercial solutions like align events, data, those don\u2019t seem to be changing. Is that kind of in line with what you would expect to be resiliency, or is there the potential that maybe those things just see effects with a lag?\nBrent Bowman: So, I think we are seeing the impact today is as you mentioned, more on the commercial side, where it\u2019s more user-based consumption. So, that modulates a bit more in the macro. So, again, it was more pronounced in Crossix, and we saw with some of our add-on business, so within the year. We haven\u2019t seen it on the R&D side. On the longer term ELA-type business, those are longer really strategic type deals. And the \u2013 they are less likely to be impacted, I would say over time.\nPeter Gassner: I would add that it has to do with the maturity of the product as well, Crossix being a special case that can go up and down with the advertising. If we look at our very mature and high market are products like PromoMats, the commercial content, CRM, that\u2019s where you are going to see it a little bit more. You have to remember in these other growth areas where we are just getting started, so data cloud, including Link encompassing their business consulting and then the R&D area, safety, CDMS, these new quality products. That\u2019s where it\u2019s mostly just about capturing new market share, right? And that\u2019s, we are not as susceptible there, right. That\u2019s just the natural cycle of getting your early adopters live and happy, getting the value out there and then capturing the market. That area has more to do with the competitive environment than it has to do with the macro.\nJoe Vruwink: Thank you very much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Jessica Long with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nBrian Peterson: Hey. It\u2019s Brian Peterson. So, Brent, I just wanted to follow-up on some earlier questions. I appreciate all the disclosure on the SMB business. But if we had to think about where you are seeing the most pronounced weakness there, is it actually with the larger end of that SMB that are more commercial where there is a more pronounced impact? I am just getting questions from investors because I think a lot of people thought maybe the SMB exposure was more R&D focused, just given the pre-commercial nature. So, I don\u2019t know if there is a way to split that out. I just want to make sure we are all clear and on the same page there.\nBrent Bowman: Yes. Hey Brian. No. So, the exposure we are seeing is more on the commercial side, as we said before, and it\u2019s more on the lower end of the SMB space. Now, we still are seeing, like I said before, increased scrutiny on larger deals that cut across both commercial and R&D. But as far as the lower spending in SMB, that is more pronounced on the lower end and on the commercial side.\nBrian Peterson: Okay, got it. And maybe just one last clarification, any help on how Crossix is priced? Have you guys disclosed that just in terms of like the methodology?\nPeter Gassner: We don\u2019t really disclose that at a detailed level. We have multiple products in Crossix that are priced differently. But in general, they will follow the amount of advertising spend the customer does in general. So, that\u2019s the way you should think about that.\nBrian Peterson: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions in queue. I would like to turn the call back to CEO, Peter Gassner for closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nPeter Gassner: Alright. Thank you everyone for joining the call today and thank you to our customers for your continued partnership and to the Veeva team for your outstanding work in the quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brent Bowman",
            "content": "Yes. So thanks, Ken. So yes, in June, we started to see some of the macro factors of plan and that continued in July at a similar pace. If you take a step back from a revenue guide perspective, we are growing revenue 18% after normalizing for FX. So we are pretty happy about that.  And if you unpack the reduction, about half of the reduction is related to FX as the dollar continued to strengthen over the last 90 days. The other half relates to the overall macro dynamics. Specifically, it's impacting commercial a bit more. We have seen some impact to Crossix as advertising budgets have tightened a bit. And we have also saw little bit of lower add-on users from SMB customers in the CRM and Vault Commercial. But I want to point out that R&D has not really been impacted by the macro. Most of the R&D products are \u2013 they are not priced on a per unit basis per user, they are priced more on the enterprise agreement, so really no long-term change in the overall business or the competitive environment. What we have seen in the change in our guidance reflects specific FX impact and macro environment. Yes. Yes. I don't recognize the 9%. I can talk to the numbers that we have. I believe on a constant currency basis, we are guiding closer to 17% for billings in Q3. But what we are seeing is that the billings the reduction in the second half has really been a factor of two things. One is FX, similar to revenue as well as the macro. On the billings side, about a third is related to FX, again, to the strengthening dollar. And then the balance is related to predominantly commercial again. So, we talked about the Crossix piece a second ago and some lighter in uptick in the number of user add-ons. R&D remains strong. So we are happy overall with the strength of the business and guiding 18% billings on an adjusted for FX and billing term changes. Yes, thank you. Yes. So FX, we see it definitely had an impact. We called out slight acceleration expectation on revenue in the prior guide and that has been challenged by the FX and the macro. The underlying business remains as strong as we thought 90 days ago. So that is unchanged at the competitive environment. It's in our favor as strong as ever. So I would think about it that way and also think about the opportunity ahead. We are still early, early days in a broad opportunity across R&D as we are the operating system for DevCloud. And then in commercial, we have a lot of opportunities as well if you think about Data Cloud and Link and the like. So lot of growth opportunities in front of us. Yes, sure, happy to. Maybe good to kind of take a step back. So first off, I know pharma represents about 90% of Veeva's overall revenue with the balance being med tech and CPMC. And we think enterprise customers represent roughly 60% of our total pharma revenue and we define enterprise as the top 50 or so largest pharma companies. So the balance of that is SMB, which is roughly 40% of the total pharma and this is made up of wide range of different customer types. We have small 100-person startup company all the way to $1 billion of revenue. So that's how we are defining it and pre-commercial is a small percentage of that. You bet. Yes, no, happy to. So what we have seen is some increased deal scrutiny. So \u2013 and that's on a deal-by-deal basis that could impact various sizes of deals. So, that's playing into the \u2013 our guide for the year. And I think you are referring to a large deal we booked back in Q1. So yes, I wouldn't say there is anything significant change in large deals other than some general additional deal scrutiny. Yes. So let me take that first one, Keith. Yes. So our \u2013 consistent with our guidance philosophy, we take all the best information to give you the best view we have of the business today. And we have a broad portfolio of customers and products. And so we have pretty good visibility into our pipes at various stages. And we have active conversations with our customers. So we have a sense of the pacing of what they are looking for. So we've factored all that in. And we considered FX, the current rates they are at. We've factored in that there is some increased deal scrutiny and also some lower spend in SMBs. So that was all informed our guidance here. Yes. So regarding the commerce space, so we still believe that 10% is the right number over time, we haven't seen anything that has changed that view. But we do expect to continue to take share. And as we take share that the impact of Veeva will in fact be less overall. We feel good about our ability to continue to expand the footprint of CRM as well as our add-on business associated with it. And then, Kirk, to your second question, we did see it some of that \u2013 we talked about lower spending in SMBs, and that's more in the lower half of that SMB definition that I was describing before because that SMB space is a very wide space. But our pre-commercial exposure is really relatively small. Yes. So, there are a few questions there. So, on linearity, we started to see some of the impact in the later part of June. So, that was where we started to see a little bit of the headwinds from a lower spend in SMBs and a little bit of additional deal scrutiny. So, the quarter started out a little bit more typical and then we started to see that later in the month of June. And then related to R&D, on a \u2013 if you exclude the impact of FX on a full year basis, it's closer to 32% growth full year. So, we are very pleased with what we are seeing from the momentum in the R&D space. Now, they are not completely immune either to additional deal scrutiny. So, if it's a large deal, there could be additional levels of approval and inspection on that. But we have not seen anything significant in the R&D space. Yes. We are not seeing anything particular in a specific geo that it was worthy of calling out from an additional exposure perspective. If you \u2013 if you take a look at the reduction, half of it is FX related. And then you can kind of split the other balance between Crossix, which you called out, there was a little bit more pronounced impact to the Crossix business and then the balance would be more broadly. So, I think your observation is a good one. So, I think we are seeing the impact today is as you mentioned, more on the commercial side, where it's more user-based consumption. So, that modulates a bit more in the macro. So, again, it was more pronounced in Crossix, and we saw with some of our add-on business, so within the year. We haven't seen it on the R&D side. On the longer term ELA-type business, those are longer really strategic type deals. And the \u2013 they are less likely to be impacted, I would say over time. Yes. Hey Brian. No. So, the exposure we are seeing is more on the commercial side, as we said before, and it's more on the lower end of the SMB space. Now, we still are seeing, like I said before, increased scrutiny on larger deals that cut across both commercial and R&D. But as far as the lower spending in SMB, that is more pronounced on the lower end and on the commercial side."

            "name": "Peter Gassner",
            "content": "Thank you, Ato and welcome everyone to the call. We had a solid Q2 with revenue ahead of our guidance and operating income at our guidance. Total revenue was $534 million, up 17% year-over-year and subscription revenue was up 17% to $429 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $202 million or 38%. We have revised our full year revenue guidance down by about 1.5% at the top end from $2.175 billion to $2.145 billion due to foreign currency and macroeconomic factors. We executed well in the quarter. Hiring was good, our innovation engine is working well and our customer relationships continue to get stronger as we have more solutions to offer and each of our solutions gets better. Our competitive landscape and product strategy also have never been stronger. We continue to track ahead of our goal to cross $3 billion in revenue in 2025 and have planted seeds for a long runway of growth well into the future. We will now open up the call to your questions. Yes. On the drug pricing, first, to put it in perspective, this is specific to the U.S. and that's a big part of life sciences, but certainly not the whole part of it. And then it has to do with Medicaid, which is roughly about half of the U.S., it doesn't have to do with private insurance. And it's about the top X drugs and it gets implemented in 2026. So it's too early to say how it plays out over the long-term. In the short and medium-term, it's steady as she goes. There is no changes and we just have to see how this works out over the long-term. And you had a follow-up question for Paul as well? Yes, I will take that one. It's really provide in the quality area across those customers. So big picture, what's happening is we picked a good product strategy number of years ago to have a suite of quality products all on a common platform. So QualityDocs, QMS, training and now we have introduced LIM, laboratory information management. We have announced that. So we are really the only company that has that integrated suite of products. And then we have a good account coverage as well and we are just executing. So yes, it starts \u2013 it can be a small biotech that the only thing they need from us at the very beginning might be quality or it can be a new customer that's an established customer that just happens to be starting in one of our product areas in quality and then they are going to add multiple product areas in quality or it could be a customer where quality is the first area and that's going to lead into clinical and regulatory and others. So I would say it's even mix across all three and it goes across segments, enterprise, SMB, pre-commercial goes over into med tech as well. Yes. Crossix has a few different parts to it. It's all related to advertising. Some of it is measurement, how are your advertising going and some of it is more programmatic, which is you can buy audience for us \u2013 from us, patient audiences. So there is a lot of details to the Crossix offering. But at the macro level, due to the macro environment, people spend a little bit less in advertising and so that flows through to Crossix. I would say we are real bullish on Crossix going forward. When we bought it about 3 years ago, the idea was to use it to develop data cloud, but also to integrate CRM and Crossix so we can help the industry bring together sales and marketing. And that's really playing out. So we are increasing our revenue in Crossix overall, and we're making it a broader offering and even establishing a new type of pattern with some customers where certain percentage of Crossix is done as an enterprise agreement, a baseline measurement agreement. Therefore, it will be a little less variable as we go forward. But these changes take a while to play out over time. Thanks. I'll take that one. CDMS. I would say, really happy with the progress in the quarter. And why do I say that? It's just the momentum, the \u2013 especially in the enterprise segment. The customer success with a couple of large enterprise customers we have and the progression of the sales cycle with some other enterprise customers gives me a lot of confidence. Our goal there is to be the leader in that area. Over time, and I think we will get there. Then that also leads into our digital trials, right? You have success in the core CDMS area. There are other products adjacent to CDMS which is the ePRO, patient-reported outcomes, that type of thing. The recently purchased randomization and trial supply management as well. So there is a lot of adjacent things. So we couldn't be happier with our progress and that one also. That one's like Compass. That one is a marathon, but we're ahead of the game. I think most people would say, Pete's going to win that race. It's too early to call that race for Compass because we're just getting started, so very different Compass in CDMS. Yes, it's a good question. So big picture, we're getting more products and each of the products are getting better, and we're fitting them together very nicely. And we saw that with Dev Cloud first, where we \u2013 a little, I guess, 6 years ago, 4 years ago, we started really painting this big picture. And now we're just executing on it, right, just executing. Commercial, we're doing that now as well. We made a lot of progress this year. So we have good, stable, happy customers in CRM and in commercial content, and we're leveraging that for success in these big new areas. Crossix, Data Cloud and actually our business consulting, which is our business consulting is going well. We started it 3 years ago. and it's quite profitable and has 150 people. So what we're seeing is our product strategy is right on the commercial side and on the R&D side, and we're executing well. I was really encouraged by this quarter because we just executed well, and the macro environment actually helps us for the long-term because during this time, there is a flight to quality with customers and with employees. So more rehires, more hires, getting more people, planting more seeds for future growth. Those things all last \u2013 they all ladder up to a more strategic relationship. When you have more excellent products, they fit together better, you just get more excellent relationships. And the macro, that happens. I've seen that a lot. I saw the \u2013 I'm one of those guys, right? I saw the dot-com boom and the dot-com bust. I even saw Y2K and that thing the financial crisis. And now we see COVID, right? COVID happened and then the overspending by governments, the inflation, the correction, the war in Ukraine, etcetera. But you get through these things, and it's really about it's just about execution. Do you have the right blueprint of what you're doing? Can you stay focused? Can you execute with excellence in the product and the field than you do okay? So that's why you hear optimism for me because I feel like to \u2013 we got a plan, and it's working. Yes, I agree with you. It's kind of business consulting is complete a picture for Veeva, strategic discussions about \u2013 with our customers how can they change their go-to-market motion. And that leads into both being able to introduce our products but also to influence our products, because we have a very tight relationship between our consulting group, our product group and our sales group. The feedback loop is very tight. And I don't know about every company in the world, that's for sure. But I don't know about any company that has this mix inside one company, and it's really feeling good. Yes. The first question there, I guess, for sure, in this environment, it's not great to be selling nice-to-have products, right? Those are the first that get the downturn. And we don't have a lot of nice staff products. We have real foundational ones. So I would say things are looking good for us. The advertising, which is the Crossix related business that's required over the long-term, but you can modulate it up and down. So our product footprint is more about building \u2013 it's building capabilities for the long-term, not nice to have. It's susceptible a little bit here when you have these hiccups in the macro cause people to reassess a little bit, okay, what's going on. But where you really don't want to be is in nice-to-have products. That doesn't work well in this environment. Yes. It's an excellent question. No, not really because they are all pretty foundational, and they are in their areas. If you're in safety, that's the most important thing to you. If you're in the clinical data management area, that's the most important thing to you. So there is no particular boost or slowdown in any particular area. Yes. I will take that one. Certainly, the hiring environment is better now than it was a year ago. In terms of M&A potential, yes, when the valuations come down, and the speculation comes off a little bit, it is a more attractive M&A environment and so we are looking, but we are always patient. We have a \u2013 so far, 100% track record of success on our acquisitions. That's hard to do. So, we are a bit careful and surgical, but we are looking. And when you are looking, you might find something, but you don't know exactly when you find it. I would add that it has to do with the maturity of the product as well, Crossix being a special case that can go up and down with the advertising. If we look at our very mature and high market are products like PromoMats, the commercial content, CRM, that's where you are going to see it a little bit more. You have to remember in these other growth areas where we are just getting started, so data cloud, including Link encompassing their business consulting and then the R&D area, safety, CDMS, these new quality products. That's where it's mostly just about capturing new market share, right? And that's, we are not as susceptible there, right. That's just the natural cycle of getting your early adopters live and happy, getting the value out there and then capturing the market. That area has more to do with the competitive environment than it has to do with the macro. We don't really disclose that at a detailed level. We have multiple products in Crossix that are priced differently. But in general, they will follow the amount of advertising spend the customer does in general. So, that's the way you should think about that."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Paul Shawah",
            "content": "Keith, I'll take the second part of your question around data cloud. So first, just defining that at the highest level, Data Cloud is Open Data, Link, and Compass. I think you may be referring to Compass, but let me hit each of them really quickly. Open Data is our customer reference data, state grower. That's been around for a while, Link. We announced that a number of years ago as one product, link for key people that has really great momentum, momentum in the enterprise and the SMB. We also announced four additional Link products which are getting \u2013 they are all in the very early stages with early adopters, but they are getting a lot of excitement because of the momentum we've created with that first Link product. So Link family of applications, that's doing really well. And then the third area, which I think you may be referring to is driving additional speed is Compass. And Compass is \u2013 remember, that's our patient data, that's what we launched first and prescriber. And over time, we will have sales data in that area. We're really focused on the patient data side. Think about that Compass is really a marathon for us, right? We're in the very early stages with patient data. It's progressing well. We had four customer wins there. And the way to think about a customer win is they'll start with a brand and that brand will have a couple of use cases and they'll buy our data for those use cases. It could be something like defining the patient journey, understanding how to treat patients, it maybe finding more doctors based on the patients that they treat. That's what they would use it for. We have to deliver customer success in those areas. And then once we deliver on that, we will expand within that brand team, maybe additional products and then also across brands, selling new products to other brands in that company. So you can see it's kind of step-wise. It will take time for us. There is \u2013 we're accelerating in that space. We're highly focused on it. And we think all the time about things about how we can kind of further accelerate in there, and we're executing on most of those. So I am happy with the execution. It's going well, but that gives you a sense of what's in data cloud and all we feed on each other, right? All the products are connected together. So we are \u2013 we think we have the right product strategy and we are going to continue to execute there. I was just reflecting on your question, Kirk, and give you a bonus answer here. In terms of the products, it has more to do with just the natural cycles in the industry that \u2013 which run longer than the temporary macro. So, for example, some of the best progress we have had in the last year is actually in our regulatory in the upper end of the enterprise in the regulatory area. And that's just a function of us having good products and customer success in the industry, just it's a natural \u2013 we are approaching that second replacement cycle. So, it's more the natural rhythms rather than the macro. Yes. Hey Ryan, this is Paul. Can you just repeat the specific phenomenon? It kind of broke up when you said that. What are you seeing? Got it. Okay. Thanks Ryan. Thanks for repeating that. Yes, where most of the industry is entering their budget planning cycle right now, so those \u2013 a lot of those conversations are kind of hitting full swing in most life sciences companies. And no, I have not heard we are seeing that yet. It's just \u2013 again, like Peter talked about, a lot of what pharma does is these longer cycle, longer planning kinds of things, and we haven't seen any indication that budgets will be impacted next year. So, we haven't heard that yet, but time will tell. Yes. It's mostly a lack of expansion. So, the add-on of additional CRM users, add-on of Chrome app users, there is always some level of churn that happens. You don't see it, but companies get acquired as one example. Our companies go out of business or they go up or they go down. That is very natural. It's very common. It happens every single quarter. That was not unusual in this quarter. It was more what Brent had referenced earlier."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ato Garrett, Senior Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nAto Garrett: Good afternoon, and welcome to Veeva's fiscal 2023 first quarter earnings conference call for the quarter ended April 30, 2022. As a reminder, we posted prepared remarks on Veeva's Investor Relations website just after 1 PM Pacific today. We hope you've had a chance to read them before the call. Today's call will be used primarily for Q&A. With me today for Q&A are Peter Gassner, our Chief Executive Officer; Paul Shawah, EVP, Commercial Strategy; and Brent Bowman, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding trends, our strategies and the anticipated performance of the business, including guidance regarding future financial results. These forward-looking statements will be based on our current views and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the risks listed in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our most recent filing on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements made during this call are being made as of today, June 1, 2022, based on the facts available to us today. If this call is replayed or viewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Veeva disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We may discuss our guidance on today's call, but we will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. On the call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. Our reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today's earnings release and in the supplemental investor presentation, both of which are available on our website. With that, thank you for joining us, and I will turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you, Ato, and welcome to everyone on the call. It was a great start to the year for Veeva, with strong first quarter results above our guidance. We also crossed the $2 billion revenue run rate mark for the first time. Total revenue was up 16% to $505 million, and subscription revenue was up 18% to $403 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $200 million or 40% of total revenue. Things are going well. Demand is strong, as customers look to establish the right digital foundations for the future, and our industry partnerships continue to get more strategic. We're executing well against our long-term plans, and our innovation engine is really firing on all cylinders. We're building a very durable business, with a long runway of growth ahead. At this point, we'll open up the call to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nBrent Bracelin: Good afternoon. I guess, Peter, Veeva closed one of the largest deals in the history of the company here, arguably in a macro environment where there's clear challenges. Could you just drill down into kind of the decision for that customer to kind of go all in on Veeva on the clinical side? It looks like a very large comprehensive deal. Just trying to better understand why a top 20 pharma would make this move in an environment where there's still some pretty significant challenges out there.\nPeter Gassner: Yes. It's a great question. This is really a long-term thinking move by the customer. They \u2013 thinking of this in 10 and 20-year horizon, so they wouldn't be really phased by specifics of the macro environment. So, this is about, yes, applications in the clinical area, but also in the quality and the regulatory area, not all of our development cloud, but a big portion of it.  So, when they're doing that, it's a very top-down decision. It's like building a huge factory. That's why it's not affected by the macro environment. And then if you get it, what they're trying to do, it's laying the foundation for efficiency, digital efficiency, getting drugs to market faster to help patients, so long-term play by the customer and sort of executive level decision.\nBrent Bracelin: Helpful. And then just a quick follow-up for Brent here. As you think about capital allocation, the company is generating a significant amount of free cash flow here, a strong balance sheet. How are you thinking about shareholder allocation, capital allocation just given the very strong cash assets you have and strong free cash flow? Thanks.\nBrent Bowman: Yes. Thanks for the question, Brent. Yes. So we do have $2.8 billion in cash and our business model has consistently been able to generate cash. So, we're very pleased with that. And our focus is primarily to invest for growth. And specifically, we're going to be looking at ways like M&A to \u2013 for use of our cash, right? But we're going to take a disciplined approach as we look at M&A. And we have had some very good successes like Crossix and Zinc, where we have good synergistical connection with them from a technology, but also from a people perspective. So, M&A is an area that we're looking at for a use of cash and -- but we'll take a disciplined approach about that.\nBrent Bracelin: That\u2019s all I had. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird. Your line is open. \nJoe Vruwink: Great. Hi everyone. I was maybe just hoping to start by walking through some of the moving pieces, the forecast for the year now versus what was presented a quarter ago. And maybe split out organically, what's changed versus \u2013 certainly FX is in there. And then anything else you would call out particularly as it relates to your hiring plans and how that is influencing the view into the second half of the year?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. Thanks, Joe. It's Brent. Yes. So first off, we're pleased with our execution in Q1. We executed extremely well across all of our metrics. And as if you look out at the full year, we did increase our total revenue guide by about $5 million now specifically to services. We did call out FX exposure. Traditionally, FX is not material to Veeva. But with the strengthening of the dollar, the USD relative specifically and most importantly to euro as well as the yen, it has had an impact. So, it's about a $20 million impact.  And more than half of that on the revenue line was created in the last 90 days. So that's a new piece of information and that was $30 million on the billings line. So absent that FX impact, we would have increased our subscription revenue line for the full year and our total billings for the full year. So that kind of gives you some context on the topline.  Regarding hiring, we have an outstanding hiring quarter. We hired 203 net employees. That's another quarter of 20-plus percent growth and in doing that, we were able to still increase our operating income guide for the full year by $10 million. So you can see the operational efficiency we're seeing in our fundamental model and how that flows through to op income. So demand overall is strong. We're excited about the demand profile we're seeing. And that kind of gives you -- informs you a bit on our full year view.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. Thanks, Brent. That's helpful. And then, more on product traction. I wanted to focus on eTMF, because it looks like it actually picked up momentum sequentially just based on the new customer adds. And I seem to recall that CTMS was already setting up for a big year. So I kind of think about eTMF as maybe a feeder for broader clinical engagement, ultimately. I guess, if both ends of the spectrum are doing well, maybe where -- what inning, to use an analogy, might we be in, in terms of penetration of the clinical opportunity and just how impactful that could be for R&D this year?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. Clinical is certainly a long runway. It's a very big area of life sciences. eTMF, I think we sold our first customer roughly in 2012, and it takes a while to really become the dominant player. And we're there now with eTMF, and there's a network of -- a network effect. eTMF is just the thing you do in clinical. Probably the next furthest along is our CTMS and study start-up products. They\u2019re getting to be pretty dominant products. And then the clinical data management is yet to come. That's very early in its life cycle, CDMS, the clinical data management. And beyond that, you have the digital trials, the MyVeeva for Patients, things right out to the patients. So, really long runway of growth in clinical. It's a big critical area. And macro level, we're just getting started there. And you're right, eTMF is a very strong base, because that's the foundational system of record of documentation for a clinical trial that every pharmaceutical company is required to have.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Peterson with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nBrian Peterson: Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the question. So I just want to follow up on Brent's line of questioning. In terms of these large wins with multiple products, I'm curious, as we think about the later-stage pipeline, how many potential products are they looking at? Is it suite adoption across the board, or how do we think about attach rates and deal sizes for what's in a later-stage pipeline?\nPeter Gassner: Well, it'll vary by customer. Now there's very few of the large pharma that are going to take that very broad suite approach, simply because of the fact that many of the large pharma are started in one way area or another with Veeva. So I think the most common in large pharma would be looking at a suite of things and then starting in the area of that suite and then graduating from there. In the smaller pharma or the emerging biotech, it's more common to look at the whole development cloud all at once and sort of know that, that's the direction you're going, but you'll consume products as you need them. So, for example, the earliest thing you need in the small biotech is probably our quality products, because you need that even before you run a clinical trial.\nBrian Peterson: Great. And maybe just a follow-up on hiring. It sounds like you're continuing to add to the team. We've heard from some other software companies that maybe they're scaling back those efforts a little bit. As you think about the investments that you're making and the growth opportunities, how are you thinking about hiring in that posture going forward?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. Hiring, we always want to attract the top talent that has a great, what we call a why Veeva, an authentic reason to be at Veeva, and that's always going to be tough. Right now, the hiring environment is tough, but not as tough as it was before because there's a bit of downturn in the tech market, especially in the early phase of the tech market, sort of speculative start-ups. People feel that, and so there's a flight to quality. So, hiring has been a bit easier for us. So, in summary, I'd say it's a good hiring environment, and we certainly don't have any hiring freeze.\nBrian Peterson: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dylan Becker with William Blair. Your line is open.\nDylan Becker: Yeah, hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe, Peter, one for you. As we talk about that large-scale deal, historically, maybe there were different purchasing decisions between sales and marketing and R&D teams. But can you walk through maybe how the broader standardization converges these swim lanes to that executive level that you just kind of touched on and the confidence that you have, given that you've served as that industry strategic partner for potentially more of these deals to kind of work themselves through the pipeline in coming quarters and years?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. It's -- we have a broader product portfolio that allows us to be closer to the customer, have more strategic discussions, have more account partner coverage because we have a broader product portfolio. So, it does tend to force the discussion up a level. Now rarely do we see the discussion combined across the commercial side of the business and the R&D side of the business because those are viewed quite differently. More so, what we see is across the different areas of R&D, clinical, quality, regulatory, we see that crossing and across the different areas in the commercial area, sales, medical marketing, that's where we see the crossing happening. I would say another significant area where we see crossing \u2013 just the early signs of crossing is our business evolved \u2013 started out from the software side. It's really growing now. It's starting to grow into the data side and then the consulting side.  So that crossing is happening, looking at our software or also looking at our data. Hey, I heard something about the data, maybe it's time to evaluate that software. Hey, maybe we help -- need some help with the business processes. So that's where early view, that's where the crossing, I think, is to happen in the future.\nDylan Becker: Yes. That's super helpful. Thanks for the color there. And maybe that kind of leads into the second one for Paul. We talked, I think, about maybe the broader rollout of prescriber and sales data for Data Cloud this quarter and next, now culminating that with Link and OpenData to form this data cloud offering. And it's early, right? But how do you think about each of these incremental layers adding to that broader network dynamic driving maybe even like a gravitational pull around adoption as you add more sources, more touch points to that core data asset that can refine itself and deliver greater value over time as well? Thanks guys.\nPaul Shawah: Yes. So, it's a good question. And we are expanding our data portfolio, as you've seen over the last several years, starting with OpenData and then Link. We've had a lot of momentum. We announced Compass. It's called Data Cloud initially, and now the branding is Compass, which is our patient and prescriber and sales data. These data sets are for different purposes and different reasons, but there is a network effect. There is value when you can connect all of these data sets together. And we talk about building our data sets on a common data architecture. And what that means is, they're fundamentally connected at a lower level, at a more foundational level. And what that means for our customers is they're able to get more value when they start pulling all of the pieces together. So it's on us to sell the value of each of those products individually, but our customers get more value over the long term when they combine our data, each individual data products with other data products, but also with our software. We designed them to be interoperable and work together and create more value. So there is, in a sense, a network effect, this idea that more products is more valuable than the sum of each of the individual pieces.\nDylan Becker: Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. First, I wanted to maybe drill a little bit more into the macro side of things. It looks like things are pretty resilient on your front, which is great to see, but also I think you expected just given the end market you're dealing with. Can you talk a little bit about maybe are there any areas that you are seeing softness at all? I mean, we have heard about biotech funding slowing down. Some CROs are slowing down, their hiring that they've talked about publicly. And then maybe on the med tech side of the business, any kind of macro things there? Maybe help us understand those pieces. And then I have a follow-up.\nPeter Gassner: Hi, Rishi, this is Peter. Really, we're not seeing the macro effects in any particular segment. Life sciences industry overall is pretty robust, right? It's not a cyclical industry, and the science is propelling it forward. The precision medicine, the renewed focus on vaccine, the RNA platforms. So the science is propelling it forward. So I'm not -- and now as far as med tech also, the science is moving things forward in med tech as well. In addition to the regulatory environment in med tech is becoming more stringent. There's more regulatory requirements, especially in the clinical area. So that's driving adoption. So not seeing any softness.\nRishi Jaluria: All right. Wonderful. And then, Peter, in your prepared remarks, you talked about some of the success that you're seeing from having the in-person conferences again and, arguably, how it's maybe more important than before with everyone working remotely. Can you talk to us a little bit about what has just been the general customer feedback off your first in-person conference in, I guess, more than two years? And more importantly, as these conferences come back and you start to extend those two-day conferences, what sort of impact do you expect? Is that something that more customers will start to think strategically about going all-in on Veeva? Is it just from a networking perspective, what sort of kind of benefits do you expect to see now that we're back to in-person conferences, for you guys from a business perspective? Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: Yes. Just the overall speed of business in the long term, connectivity, relationship building, knowledge sharing, the position that Veeva has as the place where you get together in person, yes, to learn about Veeva, that's one thing, but also to -- oftentimes, we have customers meeting their far-flung teams together in-person at the first time at a Veeva Summit. So they may extend a day and do their own planning meetings, and that's something we facilitate and participate in. So that's really what it means. It moves business forward. Summits have always been a key part of our industry cloud, always been a key part. And in-person, it's hard to replicate on the phone. One of the things we've done is we're going to optimize \u2013 we are optimizing the format going forward, so that it's more free time for connections actually. So, we will record some of the sessions, so you can see them before or after. And at the summit, yes, we'll have sessions, but more free time for connections because that's what customers are creating. I think that's going to help the industry move forward.\nQ \u2013 Rishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is open. \nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Peter, maybe for you. A lot of talk about Data Cloud in the prepared comments. Can you just talk a little bit about early reception to Data Cloud? And maybe more specifically, how much appetite is there out there for alternative product in \u2013 or alternative data, I should say, in spaces like prescription, for example?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. Great question. It's definitely early adopter for Data Cloud and specifically in the area of Compass, the Compass part of Data Cloud because there's been a vendor there -- a company there that sort of set the standard and it's just the way you do it, and that's for literally more than 20 years. So, people have just gotten become accustomed to that. So, it'll take a while before the first customers really have success, before we refine our products and before people see that, wow, there's a fundamentally different way to do this.  Instead of selling data by the record and delivering it in a file, you'll sell it by the use case \u2013 unlimited data by the use case and deliver it through software. So that's a -- that's different. And that's the definition of an early adopter who's going to understand that, lean into that change and that it'll be a small part of the market that wants to go that early adopter than when the value proposition is proved out, and you can start moving into the mainstream. So, it's actually happening just like we thought it would happen.\nSaket Kalia: That's great. Good to hear. Paul, maybe for you. Maybe just digging into the commercial side, a little bit more, particularly the CRM side. How has churn looked there? And what are you hearing from commercial customers on how they're thinking about their sales forces long term? Does that make sense?\nPaul Shawah: It does, yes. So, on the attrition side, first, we had a really strong quarter in CRM. We added 12 customers. We increased our share again in the quarter. So another really strong quarter. The \u2013 there was some churn and some attrition, which is what we expected. It was in line with what we had anticipated and planned for and was offset from a user perspective, a seat perspective, it was more than offset by the expansions that we had. You probably heard Peter talk about the wins in the domestic Japanese market, largely offset any churn and any attrition.  The \u2013 I think the second part of your question is, how are companies thinking about their sales forces long term. This is the -- it's one of the most effective, if not the most effective channel to the market and the sales teams sales forces work. So, most companies are thinking on the margins, how do they tweak? How do they gain a little additional productivity and efficiency? How do they become more digital? What's the optimal mix look like? But fundamentally, the sales force is a really critical channel, particularly as many of our customers are more focused on highly specialized medicines. You just need that human being and that human relationship to educate and bring those medicines to market effectively. So really strategic and important channel. And I think we'll see over the -- through the rest of this year some tweaking on the margins, but the -- but it's certainly a strong and important channel for the industry.\nSaket Kalia: Very helpful. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephanie Davis with SVB Securities. Your line is open.\nStephanie Davis: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Congrats on a solid quarter. Could you give us an update on some of your hiring processes, because you did say in your prepared remarks that another strong hiring quarter? And, if so, has it had any impact to sales like you mentioned last quarter? Is there any way to tease out the impact of billings timing or rev rec as a result?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. So on your question -- Stephanie, hi, it's Brent. So our plans were to hiring at the pace we are. We have, like I said, a strong Q1 hiring quarter with about net 203 people. And from our ability to execute on revenue billings, we have the capacity to deliver our guide. So we feel really good about our ability to deliver on the guide and the headcount we're bringing on board and how they're ramping up. So we feel really good about that.\nStephanie Davis: And another quick one for you, Brent. Could you help us understand the large wins flow through to billings? Like, should we think of this as being built all at once, or is it going to give a halo effect to further quarters beyond 1Q?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. So the large deal we talked about earlier, we're really excited about that. Most importantly, on that deal is -- it's a great proof case -- proof point for the operating system for development. Now, we're not going to get into the specifics of how any one transaction is accounted for, because we\u2019re very focused on customer success. And no one deal is the same. So it has been factored into our guidance. When we set guidance, we look at the pipe that's in front of us, we look at the actuals, we look at the macroeconomic environment. So it's all been factored in.\nStephanie Davis: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ryan MacDonald with Needham. Your line is open.\nRyan MacDonald: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And congrats on a great quarter. Peter, I wanted to follow up on the large customer win. And you talked about sort of the decision was being made with 10 to 20-year increments despite, obviously -- so essentially ignoring sort of near-term macro impact. I'm curious, though, as you think about implementations and project work, are you seeing any changes in sort of the pace of which those large deals that you win are getting implemented, given what we're seeing from a macro perspective?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. Ryan, good question. No, we're not, really. I think what's happening -- there was some disruption six months ago, I would say, COVID hitting, Omicron, COVID fatigue, early inflation worries, things like that, the holidays. We're not seeing that, and that hit Veeva and our customers. We're not seeing that type of slowdown anymore. Customers have -- they've -- it generally feels like they've weathered the COVID storm, which you got to remember, that was really something for life sciences, right? That was really something, disrupted their product plans, et cetera. And then we had hiring, and then we had inflation. It kind of comes through that now. So no, I don't see those same dynamics.\nRyan MacDonald: Thanks for the clarification. Brent, maybe a follow-up for you. A question we're getting a lot in almost every investor meeting is, obviously, given the state of the market and valuations coming down, question is around share-based compensation and how we should think that's trending throughout fiscal '23. We noticed obviously compared to fourth quarter, number was up slightly or maybe more so than we seasonally expected. Can you just remind us on how you're thinking about share-based compensation for 2023?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. I mean share-based compensation is a key portion of our overall compensation philosophy, if you think about our base salary and then kind of the overall equity portion of the balance. So, it's an area that we are reflected. It's been reflected into our guide. And it's an instrument that we think is important from a retention perspective and from an employee success perspective. So, it is definitely a lever that we use to drive a fair overall compensation structure for employee success.\nRyan MacDonald: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Adi [ph] on for Kirk. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask a little bit of a follow-up on the FX stuff. Obviously, you said there's the headwind, but can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing specifically in the pipeline that kind of gives you the confidence for taking that in the guide, whether that's just larger dealers meet just like kind of across the board? And then the second question is just -- yes. Sorry. Go ahead.\nBrent Bowman: Yes. No, go ahead. You have to two parts. I'm sorry, I thought it is one-part question. Go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Second part was just about -- you had a really strong start with billings this quarter. Why not raise it going forward? Is there -- and also is there like any FX impact on billings outside just that revenue component? Thanks.\nBrent Bowman: Yes. Yes. Happy to answer that. So just kind of a step back to sort of a level set on the FX impact. So overall, we're happy with the strength of the business. Now the FX impact was, on a full year basis, was $20 million on revenue, and it was $30 million on billings. So that's a headwind on both of those line items. Overall, on an op income perspective, there's kind of a natural hedge with our cost structure relative to revenue in foreign currency. So, it's minimal to no impact on the op income basis. So important to kind of level set on that. The other piece that\u2019s important that is, more than half of that FX headwind was created in the last 90 days. So as a result, we were -- that impacted our ability to increase the full year guide for both subs revenue as well as total billings. Absenteeism we would have increased our guide for those two numbers.  You also asked what gives me confidence in the guide for the year. So, we do expect for slight revenue acceleration in the back half of the year. And why do we have confidence in that? We have confidence in that because we do have good visibility to the deal flow for the year. We are a strategic partner to a critical industry. And our software and solutions are serving the need of their critical business processes. So, this isn't a transactional business that we manage on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So because of that, we have good visibility. So with that, we have confidence on the full year guide.\nUnidentified Analyst: Awesome. Thank you.\nBrent Bowman: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Bressner with Morgan Stanley. Your line open.\nRyan Bressner: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I found your disclosure on P&E being 1.5% in FY 2023 versus 3% pre-COVID listing [ph]. Do you expect P&E to remain near as level moving forward? And is that becoming a broader trend in the pharma industry? Trying to think about it in the sense of the bigger picture discussion on the change role of pharma reps and how this could maybe imply, how the industry is evolving and what tools need to kind of adapt to this hybrid environment moving forward.\nPeter Gassner: Okay. So I think it's kind of a two-part question here. Brent, why don't you take the first one as to our internal? And then, Paul, you can take the second one on the industry because those are actually two different things.\nBrent Bowman: Yes. So let me kick that off. Yes. So you're right, as we have been highlighting, we expected spending, travel and -- the spending to come back in and be a bit of a headwind to op income in fiscal year 2023. And that has happened. So we're at about 1.5% of revenue. We're about 0.5% of revenue in fiscal year 2022. That's a good thing. Why is that a good thing? Because, as Peter mentioned, with the excitement we had with in-person events, with the Commercial Summit we have last week, that's a great example. The other piece to think about is we're a work-anywhere company. And what is really important, and we've gotten that right from day one as we've been consistent. So -- but with that, connecting is really important. So we expect different functional groups to travel to stay connected, and that's all going to be part of the equation. Now looking out, where could this be? It's early, right? Where this ultimately lands is to be determined. But for the guide for the year, we expect the travel and events to accelerate a bit through the course of the year. That's our expectations for now.\nPaul Shawah: There was a second part. And Ryan, can you repeat the second part of the question again, just so I'm answering the right question.\nRyan Bressner: Sure. I guess, the second part was just on, what this might imply in the industry, as it\u2019s continuing across all pharma, for a changing role of pharma reps and how maybe the broader selling model in the industry is changing, what that means for headcount and technology.\nPaul Shawah: Yes. What it means? So we've talked about some of the shift that's happening in the industry where the issue is, becoming a little bit more efficient. They're increasing their mix of digital into the sales force. So that's one impact that's changing. That's creating a little bit of an opportunity for companies where they become more productive. They're able to do more with less, and we're seeing that play out. We've been talking about that for some time. I think the other impact that we're seeing -- so that will have an impact on overall headcount, particularly on the field sales force. But there are other rules beyond just the sales reps. One example are medical -- like, field medical teams. These are the more high science type people who call on doctors or thought leaders and scientific experts. That's one example of a different kind of role. Many companies are thinking about different roles in the field. Medical is a one good example. And some of those are actually increasing. So the role of medical is becoming more important over time. We're seeing other kinds of roles emerge in the commercial and in the medical side. So there's -- in some cases, there's some reductions. In other cases, there's increases. And we've kind of talked about that overall sizing for some time now. Yes. So we see the kind of the size and the shape shifting just a little bit, and we're happy to be part of helping the industry to be able to kind of make those adjustments and become more productive.\nRyan Bressner: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to CEO, Peter Gassner, for closing remarks.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today and thank you to our customers for your continued partnership and to the Veeva team for your outstanding work in the quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brent Bowman",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks for the question, Brent. Yes. So we do have $2.8 billion in cash and our business model has consistently been able to generate cash. So, we're very pleased with that. And our focus is primarily to invest for growth. And specifically, we're going to be looking at ways like M&A to \u2013 for use of our cash, right? But we're going to take a disciplined approach as we look at M&A. And we have had some very good successes like Crossix and Zinc, where we have good synergistical connection with them from a technology, but also from a people perspective. So, M&A is an area that we're looking at for a use of cash and -- but we'll take a disciplined approach about that. Yes. Thanks, Joe. It's Brent. Yes. So first off, we're pleased with our execution in Q1. We executed extremely well across all of our metrics. And as if you look out at the full year, we did increase our total revenue guide by about $5 million now specifically to services. We did call out FX exposure. Traditionally, FX is not material to Veeva. But with the strengthening of the dollar, the USD relative specifically and most importantly to euro as well as the yen, it has had an impact. So, it's about a $20 million impact.  And more than half of that on the revenue line was created in the last 90 days. So that's a new piece of information and that was $30 million on the billings line. So absent that FX impact, we would have increased our subscription revenue line for the full year and our total billings for the full year. So that kind of gives you some context on the topline.  Regarding hiring, we have an outstanding hiring quarter. We hired 203 net employees. That's another quarter of 20-plus percent growth and in doing that, we were able to still increase our operating income guide for the full year by $10 million. So you can see the operational efficiency we're seeing in our fundamental model and how that flows through to op income. So demand overall is strong. We're excited about the demand profile we're seeing. And that kind of gives you -- informs you a bit on our full year view. Yes. So on your question -- Stephanie, hi, it's Brent. So our plans were to hiring at the pace we are. We have, like I said, a strong Q1 hiring quarter with about net 203 people. And from our ability to execute on revenue billings, we have the capacity to deliver our guide. So we feel really good about our ability to deliver on the guide and the headcount we're bringing on board and how they're ramping up. So we feel really good about that. Yes. So the large deal we talked about earlier, we're really excited about that. Most importantly, on that deal is -- it's a great proof case -- proof point for the operating system for development. Now, we're not going to get into the specifics of how any one transaction is accounted for, because we're very focused on customer success. And no one deal is the same. So it has been factored into our guidance. When we set guidance, we look at the pipe that's in front of us, we look at the actuals, we look at the macroeconomic environment. So it's all been factored in. Yes. I mean share-based compensation is a key portion of our overall compensation philosophy, if you think about our base salary and then kind of the overall equity portion of the balance. So, it's an area that we are reflected. It's been reflected into our guide. And it's an instrument that we think is important from a retention perspective and from an employee success perspective. So, it is definitely a lever that we use to drive a fair overall compensation structure for employee success. Yes. No, go ahead. You have to two parts. I'm sorry, I thought it is one-part question. Go ahead. Yes. Yes. Happy to answer that. So just kind of a step back to sort of a level set on the FX impact. So overall, we're happy with the strength of the business. Now the FX impact was, on a full year basis, was $20 million on revenue, and it was $30 million on billings. So that's a headwind on both of those line items.

So important to kind of level set on that. The other piece that's important that is, more than half of that FX headwind was created in the last 90 days. So as a result, we were -- that impacted our ability to increase the full year guide for both subs revenue as well as total billings. Absenteeism we would have increased our guide for those two numbers.  You also asked what gives me confidence in the guide for the year. So, we do expect for slight revenue acceleration in the back half of the year. And why do we have confidence in that? We have confidence in that because we do have good visibility to the deal flow for the year. We are a strategic partner to a critical industry. And our software and solutions are serving the need of their critical business processes. So, this isn't a transactional business that we manage on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So because of that, we have good visibility. So with that, we have confidence on the full year guide. Thank you. Yes. So let me kick that off. Yes. So you're right, as we have been highlighting, we expected spending, travel and -- the spending to come back in and be a bit of a headwind to op income in fiscal year 2023. And that has happened.

            "name": "Peter Gassner",
            "content": "Thank you, Ato, and welcome to everyone on the call. It was a great start to the year for Veeva, with strong first quarter results above our guidance. We also crossed the $2 billion revenue run rate mark for the first time. Total revenue was up 16% to $505 million, and subscription revenue was up 18% to $403 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $200 million or 40% of total revenue. Things are going well. Demand is strong, as customers look to establish the right digital foundations for the future, and our industry partnerships continue to get more strategic. We're executing well against our long-term plans, and our innovation engine is really firing on all cylinders. We're building a very durable business, with a long runway of growth ahead. At this point, we'll open up the call to your questions. Yes. It's a great question. This is really a long-term thinking move by the customer. They \u2013 thinking of this in 10 and 20-year horizon, so they wouldn't be really phased by specifics of the macro environment. So, this is about, yes, applications in the clinical area, but also in the quality and the regulatory area, not all of our development cloud, but a big portion of it.  So, when they're doing that, it's a very top-down decision. It's like building a huge factory. That's why it's not affected by the macro environment. And then if you get it, what they're trying to do, it's laying the foundation for efficiency, digital efficiency, getting drugs to market faster to help patients, so long-term play by the customer and sort of executive level decision. Yes. Clinical is certainly a long runway. It's a very big area of life sciences. eTMF, I think we sold our first customer roughly in 2012, and it takes a while to really become the dominant player. And we're there now with eTMF, and there's a network of -- a network effect. eTMF is just the thing you do in clinical. Probably the next furthest along is our CTMS and study start-up products. They're getting to be pretty dominant products. And then the clinical data management is yet to come. That's very early in its life cycle, CDMS, the clinical data management. And beyond that, you have the digital trials, the MyVeeva for Patients, things right out to the patients. So, really long runway of growth in clinical. It's a big critical area. And macro level, we're just getting started there. And you're right, eTMF is a very strong base, because that's the foundational system of record of documentation for a clinical trial that every pharmaceutical company is required to have. Well, it'll vary by customer. Now there's very few of the large pharma that are going to take that very broad suite approach, simply because of the fact that many of the large pharma are started in one way area or another with Veeva. So I think the most common in large pharma would be looking at a suite of things and then starting in the area of that suite and then graduating from there. In the smaller pharma or the emerging biotech, it's more common to look at the whole development cloud all at once and sort of know that, that's the direction you're going, but you'll consume products as you need them. So, for example, the earliest thing you need in the small biotech is probably our quality products, because you need that even before you run a clinical trial. Yes. Hiring, we always want to attract the top talent that has a great, what we call a why Veeva, an authentic reason to be at Veeva, and that's always going to be tough. Right now, the hiring environment is tough, but not as tough as it was before because there's a bit of downturn in the tech market, especially in the early phase of the tech market, sort of speculative start-ups. People feel that, and so there's a flight to quality. So, hiring has been a bit easier for us. So, in summary, I'd say it's a good hiring environment, and we certainly don't have any hiring freeze. Yes. It's -- we have a broader product portfolio that allows us to be closer to the customer, have more strategic discussions, have more account partner coverage because we have a broader product portfolio. So, it does tend to force the discussion up a level. Now rarely do we see the discussion combined across the commercial side of the business and the R&D side of the business because those are viewed quite differently. More so, what we see is across the different areas of R&D, clinical, quality, regulatory, we see that crossing and across the different areas in the commercial area, sales, medical marketing, that's where we see the crossing happening. I would say another significant area where we see crossing \u2013 just the early signs of crossing is our business evolved \u2013 started out from the software side. It's really growing now. It's starting to grow into the data side and then the consulting side.  So that crossing is happening, looking at our software or also looking at our data. Hey, I heard something about the data, maybe it's time to evaluate that software. Hey, maybe we help -- need some help with the business processes. So that's where early view, that's where the crossing, I think, is to happen in the future. Hi, Rishi, this is Peter. Really, we're not seeing the macro effects in any particular segment. Life sciences industry overall is pretty robust, right? It's not a cyclical industry, and the science is propelling it forward. The precision medicine, the renewed focus on vaccine, the RNA platforms. So the science is propelling it forward. So I'm not -- and now as far as med tech also, the science is moving things forward in med tech as well. In addition to the regulatory environment in med tech is becoming more stringent. There's more regulatory requirements, especially in the clinical area. So that's driving adoption. So not seeing any softness. Yes. Just the overall speed of business in the long term, connectivity, relationship building, knowledge sharing, the position that Veeva has as the place where you get together in person, yes, to learn about Veeva, that's one thing, but also to -- oftentimes, we have customers meeting their far-flung teams together in-person at the first time at a Veeva Summit. So they may extend a day and do their own planning meetings, and that's something we facilitate and participate in. So that's really what it means. It moves business forward. Summits have always been a key part of our industry cloud, always been a key part. And in-person, it's hard to replicate on the phone. One of the things we've done is we're going to optimize \u2013 we are optimizing the format going forward, so that it's more free time for connections actually. So, we will record some of the sessions, so you can see them before or after. And at the summit, yes, we'll have sessions, but more free time for connections because that's what customers are creating. I think that's going to help the industry move forward.\nQ \u2013 Rishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Thank you so much. Yes. Great question. It's definitely early adopter for Data Cloud and specifically in the area of Compass, the Compass part of Data Cloud because there's been a vendor there -- a company there that sort of set the standard and it's just the way you do it, and that's for literally more than 20 years. So, people have just gotten become accustomed to that. So, it'll take a while before the first customers really have success, before we refine our products and before people see that, wow, there's a fundamentally different way to do this.  Instead of selling data by the record and delivering it in a file, you'll sell it by the use case \u2013 unlimited data by the use case and deliver it through software. So that's a -- that's different. And that's the definition of an early adopter who's going to understand that, lean into that change and that it'll be a small part of the market that wants to go that early adopter than when the value proposition is proved out, and you can start moving into the mainstream. So, it's actually happening just like we thought it would happen. Yes. Ryan, good question. No, we're not, really. I think what's happening -- there was some disruption six months ago, I would say, COVID hitting, Omicron, COVID fatigue, early inflation worries, things like that, the holidays. We're not seeing that, and that hit Veeva and our customers. We're not seeing that type of slowdown anymore. Customers have -- they've -- it generally feels like they've weathered the COVID storm, which you got to remember, that was really something for life sciences, right? That was really something, disrupted their product plans, et cetera. And then we had hiring, and then we had inflation. It kind of comes through that now. So no, I don't see those same dynamics. Okay. So I think it's kind of a two-part question here. Brent, why don't you take the first one as to our internal? And then, Paul, you can take the second one on the industry because those are actually two different things. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today and thank you to our customers for your continued partnership and to the Veeva team for your outstanding work in the quarter. Thank you."

            "name": "Paul Shawah",
            "content": "Yes. So, it's a good question. And we are expanding our data portfolio, as you've seen over the last several years, starting with OpenData and then Link. We've had a lot of momentum. We announced Compass. It's called Data Cloud initially, and now the branding is Compass, which is our patient and prescriber and sales data. These data sets are for different purposes and different reasons, but there is a network effect. There is value when you can connect all of these data sets together. And we talk about building our data sets on a common data architecture. And what that means is, they're fundamentally connected at a lower level, at a more foundational level. And what that means for our customers is they're able to get more value when they start pulling all of the pieces together. So it's on us to sell the value of each of those products individually, but our customers get more value over the long term when they combine our data, each individual data products with other data products, but also with our software. We designed them to be interoperable and work together and create more value. So there is, in a sense, a network effect, this idea that more products is more valuable than the sum of each of the individual pieces. It does, yes. So, on the attrition side, first, we had a really strong quarter in CRM. We added 12 customers. We increased our share again in the quarter. So another really strong quarter. The \u2013 there was some churn and some attrition, which is what we expected. It was in line with what we had anticipated and planned for and was offset from a user perspective, a seat perspective, it was more than offset by the expansions that we had. You probably heard Peter talk about the wins in the domestic Japanese market, largely offset any churn and any attrition.  The \u2013 I think the second part of your question is, how are companies thinking about their sales forces long term. This is the -- it's one of the most effective, if not the most effective channel to the market and the sales teams sales forces work. So, most companies are thinking on the margins, how do they tweak? How do they gain a little additional productivity and efficiency? How do they become more digital? What's the optimal mix look like? But fundamentally, the sales force is a really critical channel, particularly as many of our customers are more focused on highly specialized medicines. You just need that human being and that human relationship to educate and bring those medicines to market effectively. So really strategic and important channel. And I think we'll see over the -- through the rest of this year some tweaking on the margins, but the -- but it's certainly a strong and important channel for the industry. There was a second part. And Ryan, can you repeat the second part of the question again, just so I'm answering the right question. Yes. What it means? So we've talked about some of the shift that's happening in the industry where the issue is, becoming a little bit more efficient. They're increasing their mix of digital into the sales force. So that's one impact that's changing. That's creating a little bit of an opportunity for companies where they become more productive. They're able to do more with less, and we're seeing that play out. We've been talking about that for some time. I think the other impact that we're seeing -- so that will have an impact on overall headcount, particularly on the field sales force. But there are other rules beyond just the sales reps. One example are medical -- like, field medical teams. These are the more high science type people who call on doctors or thought leaders and scientific experts. That's one example of a different kind of role. Many companies are thinking about different roles in the field. Medical is a one good example. And some of those are actually increasing. So the role of medical is becoming more important over time. We're seeing other kinds of roles emerge in the commercial and in the medical side. So there's -- in some cases, there's some reductions. In other cases, there's increases. And we've kind of talked about that overall sizing for some time now. Yes. So we see the kind of the size and the shape shifting just a little bit, and we're happy to be part of helping the industry to be able to kind of make those adjustments and become more productive."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Veeva Systems Fiscal 2024 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] With that, I would like to turn the conference over to Gunnar Hansen, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nGunnar Hansen: Good afternoon, and welcome to Veeva's fiscal 2024 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Conference Call for the quarter and fiscal year ended January 31st, 2024. As a reminder, we posted prepared remarks on Veeva's Investor Relations website just after 1:00 PM Pacific today. We hope you have had a chance to read them before the call. Today's call will be used primarily for Q&A. With me today for Q&A are Peter Gassner, our Chief Executive Officer; Paul Shawah, EVP, Commercial Strategy; and Brent Bowman, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding trends, our strategies and the anticipated performance of the business, including guidance regarding future financial results. These forward-looking statements will be based on our current views and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the risks listed in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our most recent filing on Form 10-Q. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today, February 29, 2024, based on the facts available to us today. If this call is replayed or viewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Veeva disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We may discuss our guidance on today's call, but we will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public form. On the call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today's earnings release and in the supplemental investor presentation, both of which are available on our website. With that, thank you for joining us, and I'll turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you, Gunnar, and welcome everyone to the call. It was a great quarter and year of execution for Veeva with strength across the business and results above our guidance. Total revenue in the quarter was $631 million with non-GAAP operating income of $239 million. For the year, total revenue was $2.4 billion and non-GAAP operating income was $843 million. This past year was important in many ways for Veeva and the industry. And I'm proud of all the team accomplished. We delivered the Veeva Compass Suite, giving the industry a better alternative to legacy data. We established the clinical platform and progressed on our new commercial cloud. It was a milestone year that I think we'll look back on as one of the most significant. We'll now open up the call to your question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Vruwink: Great. Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about the services outlook and how it's changed from your preliminary views. The shareholder letter mentions investments related to both CRM at large customers. Maybe you can just go into the approach you're planning to take with these initial migrations and how it is differing from those original plans? And then related to that question, does this outlook assume there's maybe more large customers, top 20 customers, ultimately undertaking migration activity than perhaps has been publicly announced to this point?\nPeter Gassner: I'll take that one and then Paul, maybe you can join in as well. There's no major change in our strategy. It's just a refinement as things get closer into view. We've decided and have been able to provide a little more internal guidance about how much investment we'll make in Vault CRM related services. We think it's just the right thing to do. It's not -- moving to Vault CRM wasn't anything our customers asked for. They were happy with Veeva CRM. We're going to bring them a better solution over time, an integrated solution with the sales, marketing and medical, all industry-specific all in the same database. But it wasn't anything really they were asking for or budgeting for. So we really want to do the right thing by those customers because remember, Vault CRM is just -- that's just one of the things that we have with those customers. We have big customer relationships and Vault CRM is just one of the things. So we want to help them through that. So no real change and Paul, in terms of progress with top 20 type CRM customers, maybe you can give an update?\nPaul Shawah: Yes, Joe, thanks for the question. We're progressing well with our top 20 customers. Really, all of our customers pleased to announce that we -- you heard us announce two top 20 global commitments. We announced that last quarter. I'm pleased to announce a third moving their existing Veeva CRM footprint. They're committing to move all of that over to Vault CRM so now this is three top 20 pharmas. So that's just another example of the kinds of progress that we're making. We're also in deep conversation with all of the rest of top 20 and many other customers. And those conversations are progressing well, given the innovation that Peter has talked about. We're doing something fundamentally different integrating sales and marketing and medical in a very tight and unique way. So I'm optimistic you'll hear more about top 20s over time committing to Vault CRM.\nJoseph Vruwink: Okay. That's great color and congratulations on the new win. At the segment level, maybe it looks like the commercial business is set to accelerate based on the outlook. R&D decelerating. I suppose I wanted to focus on R&D because there's quite a lot of traction just in terms of what is being awarded at the moment. I think there were two new enterprise EDC wins with top 20 this quarter, for example. Is maybe the rating between the lines that the level of activity is actually better than might be reflected in revenue just in this upcoming 12 months, but you're seeing visibility for maybe strength beyond this upcoming fiscal 2025?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, I'll take that one. So if you -- if we step back just for a high level and how the business breaks down, overall, the TAM is about $20 billion, right? So it's a big TAM, and we're less than 15% penetrated. So we got a long way to go. That's important to remember that. It's a long-term thing that this is going to be a growing and profitable business for many years. And then the other thing is quite durable because these products are critical products and they're complex products. They're not things like e-mail or something like that. And then we have a lot of products that fit together. So with that, with that context, I think it's relevant to look at the different parts. And you can really break it down into three parts from sort of a revenue perspective, the Development Cloud, the R&D area. That's the biggest one. It's about 50% of our revenue right now, and it's about 65% of our overall opportunity, and it's growing roughly 20% or so and that will really grow well into the foreseeable future. And because we have a lot of new products, we have a clear competitive advantage there, and these are mission-critical systems. Now what you mentioned, Joe, is customers don't rush in these areas. These are critical systems. They don't rush and these are some long-term programs. So for example, a couple of these wins that we had they will roll out and they will get to full revenue four and five years from now. So yes, the fiscal impact comes much later. One thing important to remember about 10 years ago, when we were going public, Development Cloud, that was quite a bit less than 5% of our revenue, and now it's over 40% and still growing in the 20%. So that's Development Cloud. And then you've got this -- the other areas like our CRM and the add-ons, we kind of call that the CRM Suite. And in that area, the revenue is stable. It's not really growing because of two things. One, we have really high market share and happy customers on our core CRM or Veeva CRM and some of the add-ons. And then we need to migrate those customers to Vault CRM before we can sell the new add-on products like marketing automation and service centers. So that's kind of a stable 25%. And then the other 25% roughly is a mix of other things in commercial. And if we call that other commercial, this is some stable things like commercial content and Crossix where we are the market leaders, but we continue to grow at a moderate and steady pace and customer success is really high with those products. And then newer products like Link and Compass. And these are small now, but they're growing rapidly on a percentage basis, and they have high potential if we can execute well. Now we have to remain seen if we can execute well. So overall, this other commercial area that I talked about, that's growing roughly 15% or so now, and that can continue to grow into the foreseeable future as well. So I thought it was good to just give that background on how to look at the business overall.\nJoseph Vruwink: Now that's a lot of good detail. Thank you very much. I'll leave it there.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions here. Brent, maybe I'll start with you. Maybe just congrats on those two additional EDC wins. The question is, can you maybe talk about how billings ramps are sort of contributing to next year's billings right? You've had great success in the EDC market. Is there a way to think about sort of next year's billings growth with or without those -- the benefits of those ramps. Does that make sense?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. I understand. Thanks, Saket. So real pleased that how we exited fiscal year '24, exceeding our billings guide, so executing well there. And if you think about the EDC wins, by way of example, we're still pretty early days, as Peter said, so five of those top eight wins have been in the last 12 months. So we're still early in that ramping phase. So they're contributing. They're contributing more in fiscal year '25 than they did in fiscal year '24. And those eight will continue to contribute more as we look out forward.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. Got it. That's helpful. Peter, maybe for my follow-up for you. It's a little bit of a higher-level question. Can you just give us an update on how you're feeling about the health of your end markets, I mean, it seems like things are just relatively stable compared to last quarter, which is great to hear. But since you spend just so much time with customers, how do you think customers are thinking about investing in technology here in 2024 versus what was a tougher 2023?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. I think there's a little more optimism. The science is going well. And we've had this disruption of conflicts and interest rates for a while now and people are getting kind of used to it. So there's a little more optimism. Of course, things could change. I think that will translate into a bit more projects that get thought about this year, especially towards the end of the year. But a lot of that time, those things get kicked off in the following year. So a lot of our projects, you just don't wake up one day and say, hey, let me redo my drug safety system. Now it's these are big projects. There's some change management and there's some thought into it. But overall, I like the feeling that I feel from the industry right now.\nSaket Kalia: Very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nPeter Gassner: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Wong with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nKenneth Wong: That's fantastic. The first question for you, Brent. As I think about the outlook, you have solid teens growth on subscription and billing. I couldn't help but notice you mentioned being a little more prudent with the outlook which I think is a language you guys haven't used in the past. So I guess I would love to get a sense as we think about the guide, are you baking in additional cushion? Is it just kind of thinking about when the progression of the demand might come back through the year. Would love any additional color you can give on just how you're thinking about the makeup of guidance?\nBrent Bowman: Yes, Ken, overall, philosophically, there's no change to how we approach guidance. There's obviously a number of variables in play, whether it's the macro and the impact and how that's impacting our service or our subs business on billings, you got things like duration and frequency. So we kind of take a step back and look at all those variables, and we think we've taken a prudent approach holistically given the variables at hand. So not a fundamental change in how we guide.\nKenneth Wong: Got it. Okay. Really appreciate that color. And then for Peter, on the EDC side, I feel like historically, you guys have talked about that end market through the lens of winning new trials and that being where maybe the opportunity set was I couldn't help but notice in January you guys did a migration of a study portfolio for an enterprise customer. Like could we possibly see the installed base as a potential opportunity going forward based on what you saw with that migration?\nPeter Gassner: Let's see. How to think about that. On the EDC, when we sell EDC field, there's really two types. One would be an enterprise deal and that's where we agree, hey, it's a long term, it's enterprise agreements that will ramp over time. And over time, you'll run all your studies on Veeva. And that doesn't -- the revenue for that doesn't change based on how fast they ramp or whether they migrate or whether they don't migrate. Then we have other ones which are study-by-study costs where sometimes it's with a CRO or a small biotech, they may be only running one or two or three studies, and we may compete for that study and win that study. the migration really won't impact our revenue directly at all. What it is, is, let's say, if a customer signs up for an enterprise agreement with ours, and they're rolling out and they're quite comfortable with Veeva. They might get to a point where they have 20, 30 studies that will run for a long time, and they want to clean up their IT environment, and they want to have a consistent clinical research site experience. So they use our migration tools to clean that up rather than having some straggling studies on the legacy technology for honestly, what could be three, four, five years. And that gets brittle who knows what could happen with that straggling vendor, whether it has a downtime security patch needs to be put on, whatever it is. It's just not clean. So that migration capability actually translates into an advantage in our enterprise sales because we have that capability and nobody else really has that capability. So it would only have an effect there. It doesn't really affect in the small market where we're competing study by study.\nKenneth Wong: Perfect. Thank you, Peter.\nPeter Gassner: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Peterson with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nBrian Peterson: Thanks and congrats on the strong wins this quarter. There's been some mention in the past about some customers looking to take large bites of the apple and buying several products at once. We obviously heard a lot about wins across multiple product areas this quarter. I'm curious, are those concentrated with a few customers like the one with BI? Or is it much more diversified across the customer base? Any color there?\nPeter Gassner: I guess I can take that one. I would say this is diversified, more diversified. We had some quality wins and those were with certain customers. We had a big clinical operations win for multiple clinical operations products. That was with a customer in Europe. We have a couple of EDC of top 20 and those were actually with different customers. So, no, it's spread all around, I think, it's the best way to say it, both in US. and Europe and just different customers.\nBrian Peterson: That's great to hear. And Brent, maybe a follow-up. I know the cash balance continues to grow. How are you guys thinking about looking at capital deployment priorities over the next few years here? Thanks, guys.\nBrent Bowman: Yes. Overall, Brian, continuing to our current capital allocation strategy, no change. We run a profitable business. We generate a lot of cash. So we are focused on M&A as a use of that cash. And we are a disciplined company, and we'll take a disciplined approach to how we look at M&A. We do consider other uses of cash as a management leadership team, but our focus today is M&A.\nBrian Peterson: Thanks, Brent.\nBrent Bowman: Thanks, Brian.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to first ask on AI and maybe ask in a little bit different way because I know it feels like you're planning your cards a little bit close to the chest on your own AI strategy. But I want to ask what are you seeing out of life sciences companies in terms of how AI has changed on things, whether that's accelerating drug development, whether that's more targeted marketing, maybe if you could walk us through kind of what those conversations would look like? And what sort of role you think you can play in those changes? Then I've got a quick follow-up.\nPeter Gassner: Rishi, I would say the most direct impact, and it's been happening a while before large language models as well as AI and drug discovery. Very, very targeted AI models that can do things like protein folding and analyzing retina images, things like that. So this is -- this is very powerful, but very therapeutic area specific, very close to the science in the R&D, and I -- there's not just one AI model there is multiple specialized AI models. So that's going on, and that will continue. I would say that's kind of part of the fabric of the industry now. Then in terms of other areas, really, there's a lot of experimentation with large language models. And what people look at it for are a) Can I just have general productivity for my people? Can they write an e-mail faster? Can they check their e-mail faster? Can they research some information faster? So that's one thing that's going on. Also, specific use cases like authoring, can I -- can I author a protocol faster? Can I author a regulatory document faster? Now faster is one thing, but also have to be very accurate. So I would say there's experimentation on that. there's not yet broad production use on that. And certainly, some of these critical things has to read a lot of quality control on it. So those are probably the two biggest use cases. Really three. Research, general productivity and authoring. And then as far as our rule, we've been doing some really heavy work over the last two years on something in our Vault platform that's called the Direct Data API. And that's a pretty revolutionary way of making the data come out of fault in a consistent -- transactionally consistent manner much, much faster, roughly 100 times faster than it happens now. That's going to be critical for all kinds of AI applications on the top, which we may develop, which our customers may develop, and we're also utilizing that from some really fast system to system transfer between our different Vault family. So that's been the biggest thing that we've done. We haven't really invested heavily in large language models. So far, we just don't see quite the application in our application areas, not to say that, that wouldn't change in the future. I would, I guess, I would say we're in a pretty good position because AI really -- the durable thing about AI is the data sources, the data sources. The AI models will come on top, and that will be largely a tech commodity, but the control and the access to the data sources, that's pretty important, and that's kind of where Veeva plays.\nRishi Jaluria: Yes. Got it. Okay. That's really helpful. And then you had your first full Vault Clinical Ops Suite customer in the deal, sorry, in the quarter, can you maybe talk about the uplift from eTMF to adopting the full suite, what that looks like and what you can do to maybe accelerate more of those types of wins? Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: Yes. Now that's the specifics of that customer, of course, I won't go into the exact specifics here, but I can quickly give you my thoughts on it. I would say there that customer had eTMF, and that's one of our larger applications and has had for a number of years, fully deployed that one. When they got the other four applications in clinical operations, they more than tripled our opportunity, our end-state in clinical operations. So in that case. And I won't go into the exact numbers, but I know it's more than tripled. So it's significant. When you look at the CTMS, the clinical trial management system, that's a really important system study training, really important system for training thousands of research sites around the world and maintaining compliance and doing that in a friendly and friendly way. The payments processing. That's another thing that's key, the processing the payments out to the clinical research sites and then our product called Site Connect, which is about automating the information flow from the sites to the research, sorry, from the sites to the pharma company. During the start-up, during the conduct of the study and also critically at the end of the study, things that are called end-of-study media that have to get out to the site and we're doing that in an automated way. So there's a ton of value there that more than triples our value of eTMF.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Thank you.\nPeter Gassner: And I would say last comment that customer won't always be like that where a customer says, hey, we just really want to modernize clinical operations, and we're looking to this partner to do it, and we're going to do it in a holistic way over a number of years across a number of products. What's more common is there's a need in a certain area, study training. The study training group has a need, hey, let's use Veeva or the payments group has a need, hey, let's use Veeva. That's still the more common use case.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Stan Berenshteyn with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nStan Berenshteyn: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So you rolled out Compass Prescriber Compass National. I realize it's still early, but can you share any anecdotes about customer reception, customer demand on those products?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. It's very early. It's a good question, especially well, Compass patients, but especially prescriber and national, these are quite innovative products. So it's going to take a while for customers to understand and adopt these. It's almost like going from the cloud sorry, from client server to cloud. It's sort of, well, it's a different way of doing things. So the reaction from the customers has first been for some, they're busy and they're not interested. For some, they are like, oh, I want to look into this. And then when they look into this, like, well, wow, this is really different. And they have to absorb that a little bit. This is really different, and then for some early adopters, they have jumped on like, wow, I can target physicians that I've never been able to target before. I can see data on my competitors' products that are administered in the medical setting, not a retail product, I can see that down to the ZIP code level and the HCP level. And I can see things like unattributed scripts that where we don't -- where the -- the health, the doctor is not specified, but they can see the health system. These are things that were just not possible before. So and for a long time, not possible for really 20 years here. So now it's the process of wow, that data is available, what should I do with that data? How can I optimize? So it's -- it's going to take some time, and it's for early adopters, which will generally come in innovative companies coming to market. They don't have any existing infrastructure and they're innovative type people and hey, let's just go for that. And then what we've had is some brands in large companies that are small brands, pre-commercial brands, and they're thinking, wow, I can -- they have some freedom and latitude to go off and do what they do. And they're getting this new data set, then, okay, we'll go for that. We're the hardest ones and what just takes time, the well, the big established brands, right? Because they have a motion, and it's going and it's working. Very reticent to disrupt that because they have a limited patent life of these products, and they don't want to be risky in there. So that's a little bit of color of what we're seeing.\nStan Berenshteyn: That's very interesting. I appreciate that. Maybe as a follow-up, just sticking with the marketing team here. You called out strength in Crossix. It seems it's pretty broad-based on the prepared remarks. Is it just overall market growth? Or are you actually taking share as well here?\nPeter Gassner: I believe we're taking share, yes. What's happened is we just continue to track record of customer success, just sort of grind it out all the customers are successful with Crossix, our data network for what we're doing there is the largest and most applicable. So I think bring some boom times. There was a little more experimentation with other areas. Some people got their fingers burned a little bit. And I think that we haven't. We haven't burned anybody fingers. So customer success leads the way. I think that's the main thing.\nStan Berenshteyn: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nBrent Bracelin: Thank you. Good afternoon. I was hoping to go back to the demand environment with a specific lens towards the SMB segment and then the top 50 enterprise segment. Can you maybe just compare, contrast what you're seeing in SMB? Are there any green shoots there or not? And then also compare that with the enterprise top 50 segments, what are you seeing there relative to this year versus last year? Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: I'll take that one. This is Peter. The emerging biotechs, the small center of the segment is still a tough sliding there. This year, we saw a record number of companies get acquired and go out of business. And a small number of new companies were able to get escape velocity because of the funding environment, it's tough, and it continues to be tough. And you never know when it turns around until it turns around, all you know is that it hasn't turned around yet. Then in the top 50, I would say the feeling is just kind of a bit resigned that, hey, we're in for this -- there's some global conflicts, there's inflation, there's IRA Act, but that hasn't hurt us too bad yet, so we could just keep going. Also there's -- I think there's a renewed focus on execution and long-term execution. They're really seeing that that's important. I think there's some excitement about the science as well. Like, for example, we have some really big brands now in the city area. That's something that didn't exist three, four years ago. And so that's renewing people's optimism like, wow, the science will lead the way. So it's really different in the top 50 versus the emerging biotechs.\nBrent Bracelin: Helpful color there. And then my follow-up is back to M&A. And the question here is fiscal 2025 is going to be a very important year in that cash flow could exceed $1 billion for the first time. You have $4 billion in cash. Just thinking through the philosophy on M&A, historically, it's been around small technology tuck-ins, you're a much bigger business, you got a lot more cash flow generating coming in every year. Would you ever think about maybe larger bolt-on acquisition to go after a new area? Just thinking through M&A a little differently given the size of the business today and outsized cash generation you're generating now as well?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. I can talk to the general philosophy of M&A. I think it's no secret, I can just give you the formula. First of all, it has to make some business sense with the market. It has to be a market that we're interested to go in, either it's complementary or somewhat adjacent to what we're doing. So that would be number one. It has to have a cultural fit with the company that you're considering acquiring because otherwise, it just absolutely will not work. And 80% of acquisitions fail. But at Veeva, we've had all of our acquisitions succeed. So it's this discipline. The cultural fit is a real thing, and it's an indicator of many things, not that our culture is the best culture or whatever, but a company that doesn't fit with our culture, it will not be a successful acquisition. Third, you need to have a very clear product and organizational structure plan that's been thought out ahead of time so that you could announce it to both teams from the day you would acquire them. If that doesn't happen, it's an indicator that you don't have enough bench strength to operate this thing. And therefore, you'll lose it in the integration or the business strategy isn't actually clear because you can't say it to people. So in that, I think those are the parameters. So I don't think we would be limited by size. If we saw something that was right that hit those parameters and that would cost us $3 billion more than we would go for that. But the other thing you need to is you need a willing seller. And so it's timing of it. And that's why 80% of acquisitions fail is because people rush in and they buy things that don't fit these parameters. We're just not going to do that. I would rather return money to shareholders than wasted on a failed acquisition.\nBrent Bracelin: Makes sense. Helpful color. Thank you.\nPeter Gassner: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Wallace with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nJack Wallace: Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to go back to the guide and it seems like there's been a lot of big momentum coming into the year. We've got some price increases. We've got some ramping deals. I think the pipeline is healthy of ruling buyers, timings made a little bit of a question mark. I don't want to belabor the term prudent here, but it does feel like there's more sources of potential upside in a higher floor of -- whether it's billings or subscription revenue that kind of media had coming into the year and that it's just a matter of grinding out a handful of strategic wins in order to how to get to the high end or get above the guidance range. Am I thinking about that correctly?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. So what I would say is I wouldn't interpret the choice of words of prudent as there's this incremental level of conservatism that's baked into the guide. I guess I would start there. We've considered all the factors that we've talked about on the call today. And we've considered those and we think we have a guide that's reflective of the best calls of the numbers like we have historically. So I would think of it that way. There's a number of items to contemplate in like the services portion of the business, which can be a little bit lumpy at that business. But overall, we feel really good and have conviction on the numbers we provided.\nJack Wallace: That's helpful. And then just on the 1Q guidance, was there any lingering impact from rep reductions that over the last couple of years just impacting 1Q? And then just on the I think the third one here, the services. Just seems like you're taking a more aggressive approach there. I'm just wondering how much kind of automation potential that play to help improve the CRM migrations? Thank you.\nBrent Bowman: I can take the first portion of that on the -- on your question around rep reductions. There's -- the digital portion of those rep reductions, that's largely behind us. So there's I wouldn't think of that as an incremental headwind as you look at fiscal year '25.\nJack Wallace: Got it. Thank you.\nBrent Bowman: Okay.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please go ahead.\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you, Brent. Could we talk about your decision to raise the operating income guidance for fiscal '25. To me, that's meaningful a number of software companies seem to be going the other way where against the backdrop of needing to lean into R&D, invest in AI, they're posting somewhat shinier margin upside. But you've raised it to a pretty high 30s level. Can you talk about your calculus there?\nBrent Bowman: Yes, I'm happy to. So maybe just first taking a big step back, so we provided $1 billion plus guide about a year ago, which is a bit not typical, and we wanted to provide some context around the TFC standardization. So now you fast forward 12 months, and from that, we've been executing well, right? We've been executing over the past year. And the 39% reflects that. And that reflects our operating model and the efficiency and effectiveness we get out of our operating model, and also the power and efficiency of the Vault platform. So it really comes down to that. We're making the investments we see are necessary to drive customer success and growth. We're not short changing those. And -- but overall, it's just about execution.\nKarl Keirstead: And Brent, maybe as my follow-up -- I'm sorry, are we going to say something?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, I would just say we're -- this is Peter. We're -- as we scale, I think we're getting a little more efficient is getting more efficient in our processes, in our customer relationships and our use of our Vault platform, and we're being diligent. That was a concept we call lean teams. Not doing layoffs, but we want lean teams. We want the smallest teams possible with high-performance people that could perform well together. So this kind of discipline that's why our margins are increasing. And I think you'll see that from us increasing margins over time.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. Okay. Helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, if we could just go back to the optimism comment. It sounds like both of you, Peter and Brent are dissuading us from thinking that, that increased optimism would have any real impact on revenues and billings this year? I think we're hearing that message. But if I could just press, why not, if your clients are getting a little more optimistic, could projects that might be stalled start to move forward discretionary spend start to come back. Why not?\nPeter Gassner: I think most of these things that we deal with, we have very little discretionary stand other than in services, right, because we deal with these critical systems and complex system and they have more thinking time. They have -- they have more thinking time. So I just don't think it's stuff that would impact this year. And having said that, we don't know what's going to happen this year. We do live in some uncertain times. We have some interest rate things going on. We've got two global conflicts going on. So we have to figure that uncertainty. Again, it's not a guarantee that in September, everything is going to be the same as it is right now.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. Okay. Thanks for that color.\nPeter Gassner: Okay.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan MacDonald with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nRyan MacDonald: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe first to start out with CRM. I noticed the nine wins in the quarter and even mix of 5 Volt and 4 Veeva CRM. Just curious what you're hearing in terms of the rationalization from customers on still selecting Veeva CRM. Is it something that they don't want to wait until April of '24 to be able to do so or anything like that? And then is there -- are you contracting in a different way now for Veeva CRM versus Vault, whether it be duration or putting in commitments to migrate over to the new CRM. Just any color there would be helpful?\nPaul Shawah: Yes, Ryan, I can take that. This is Paul. So the conversations we have with all of these customers, it's a dialogue. We go in with full transparency. We talk about why they want to choose one or the other. We don't go in with a preconceived notion. We listen and talk to the customer. And then based on what their requirements are, we guide them. We try to lead the customer and make sure we make the right decision. There may be reasons to do Veeva CRM that includes some very specific features and functions that they really need early on that they want to start there with that would be a common example of why they may choose Veeva CRM of Vault CRM, but those things are going away quickly. Just to give you a perspective, we'll be a general availability in April. We're well on the way and on track for that and at full parity with everything in Veeva CRM will be in Vault CRM by the end of this year. So it's really a timing issue. And starting in April, everything will be Vault. And we're comfortable and confident in that time line and that milestone. So that gives you some guidance there. In terms of the -- how we're contracting, we're contracting in a very similar way. There's not really a material change. So the licensing is not exactly the same, but it's very similar. And then in terms of timing of contracts, it's pretty much all the same, annual deals that we do, and it's all per user base.\nRyan MacDonald: Super helpful. I appreciate that. Maybe a follow-up on the data strategy. Obviously, early days with the new prescriber national data available now. But one thing we've seem to have picked up from other vendors in the data space is that there's sort of this constant need for it, whether it be maintenance or additions to grow their data sets over time to remain competitive and maybe those are vendor-specific issues. But I'm curious now that you've got prescriber and national rolled out in addition to patient, how you're thinking about sort of that data expansion or acquisition strategy moving forward, whether that's organic or if you -- and you license it from other sources or maybe M&A makes sense. Just curious how you're thinking about data expansion strategy moving forward.\nPeter Gassner: In terms of data acquisition, yes, we make end data products that we sell to our customers. And of course, we buy data inputs, call it data acquisitions. We have a pretty unique strategy as it relates to Compass, where we're really multi-sourcing. We're sourcing data from a lot of different sources, and we have really excellent industry-leading patient tokenization process that's kind of fundamentally different than the common one out there. So when we do this, we can multisource from a lot of different places bring it together and avoid duplicates. So when we do that, we'll have more data sources than what's common, but no data source will be particularly extra critical to us. So when we see a good deal for a data source and a good set of terms, which means we can contract it for a number of years, and we know what the cost is and it's not that expensive. We'll do that. And if we see something that's not good, such as, hey, we don't have stability over multiple years or the cost is too high than we want to pay, then we just won't purchase that. So you're not going to see anything dramatic from Veeva. There's no step function in cost or something like that. Very importantly for us, these data acquisitions, they power both our Crossix business and our Compass business. So that's very different, right? With one set of data purchases, we're able to power two good-sized businesses. And so that lowers our percentage data cost\nRyan MacDonald: Super helpful color. Thanks, Peter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Windley: Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Peter does Annex 1 have any stimulative impact on your quality products, the need for your quality products? Does that regulation in Europe influence that at all?\nPeter Gassner: I don't know that one. I probably -- if I do some research, I can figure out what Annex 1 is, but we'll have to get back to you. We can get back to you offline as long as it's not a material non-public thing. So sorry about that one. You stumped me on that one.\nDavid Windley: Well, I'm sorry, I did that, but I'll ask a different one instead. So on the data comments that you just made about your data sourcing strategy, does the breadth I think I understood you to say that ability to be flexible allows you to buy when you see good deals. I was going to ask, does the breadth cause you to have to pay more money? Or does your operating expense base grow disproportionately because of the breadth of that data? Maybe the answer is the opposite.\nPeter Gassner: I can only really comment on our strategy. I wouldn't really know exactly as it compares to others. We believe we have a lower overall beta cost because of this. That's what we believe. Now the main reason to do this is for data quality. So if you're getting data from three different sources, that they're somewhat overlapping, you have a better chance of getting data quality. And this is one of the reasons why we can project data for medical claims, which is -- it might be something that's done at an infusion center. We can also project something for something that you pick up at Walgreens or CVS. Why? Well, because we're sourcing data from multiple points along the line. So the real benefit is more holistic view of the patient, we can project data for over 4,000 brands. And you can only do that. You can't do that if you're just projecting based on a few large retailers' data, you can't do that because if you look at 20 years ago or 25 when these legacy data products were started, or even when Veeva started in 2007, the biggest brand at the time was Lipitor and you've got Lipitor at the drugstore. Biggest brand now is KEYTRUDA. And you don't just walk into the drugstore and get that. It doesn't work that way or HUMIRA, et cetera. So ours is a modern approach that I think is the only way really to do it well for today's complex therapies. And I do think we'll have lower data cost over time. I do think that, but I don't have a proof of that.\nDavid Windley: Got it. And then a follow-up relatedly, and again, not to ask a stumper, but this change health care cyber hack situation where some data is being held hostage in a fairly significant health care data switch, is that a situation that, say, in the future when your products are more mature that, that actually feeds to the way that you're collecting data and makes you more reliable than maybe some others might be?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. Now as it relates to change, I am we're aware of that, of course, not the very specific details of the attack. I am aware of how the attack was made, but I'm not aware of the -- what's going on inside the change. But and I'm not going to disclose whether we get data from them or not. But yes, it is a switch. Now the good thing that happens here for the health care system most of the pharmacies are operating on relatively modern software such that they can point their software to different switches and there are standards that are in play. So that's a good thing that the health care system can recover. For us, again, without going into a lot of details, whichever way the data gets routed, there's a real good chance we're going to pick it up because we're picking it up in multiple places along the way. So I'm not -- even if we were at scale in our business, I would -- it's certainly unfortunate what happened with change, and I think it's terrible what's going on with the cyber tax, but it wouldn't affect our Compass or Crossix business.\nDavid Windley: Yeah, I appreciate you taking my questions. Great. Thank you.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nCraig Hettenbach: Thank you. A follow-up question for Brent on the margin. Nice to see the strong guidance on fiscal '25. Can you just touch on -- there's some element of services OpEx coming down. Is this -- do you think a new run rate beyond '25 or is there normalization when you think about margin after this year?\nBrent Bowman: Yes, and I would say, overall, the margin uplift we're seeing isn't really driven by services. I would say it's really a more broad thing. It's broadly how we're executing and that's how we leverage again our operating model, thinking about lean teams and really disciplined hiring broadly. So we feel good about how we've executed there. And that's basically what's informed our guide for the full fiscal year. I'm not going to talk beyond fiscal year '25 at this point in time. But we feel good about our ability to hit those operating income and our margin targets.\nCraig Hettenbach: Got it. And then just a follow-up for Peter. Just on the momentum you're seeing in EDC wins. Can you touch on what you think is resonating most with new customers and then just key differentiating factors versus competitive offerings?\nPeter Gassner: Well, as we get into this middle part of the market, I think a required thing would be positive customer references, right? If we -- our existing customers weren't happy and productive these current sales would not be happening because it is very easy for them to reach out to their peers and get a very authentic, hey, you're using Veeva today. How are you feeling about that? So I would say our customer success is leading the way. And then in terms of capabilities, it's agile study build to be able to build a complex study that has multiple arms quicker and more reliably. That's a big benefit. I would say the sort of what I would say, no coding. A lot of the existing -- at least a couple of the existing providers actually end up doing a lot of coding, actual coding work when you build a study. Now that is interesting for whoever is coding that study, but it's a bit of a headache for the people managing the study because when you have coding it's hard to keep that under control and the complexity grows and there can be errors and unforeseen things. So with Veeva, you don't do the custom coding, I would say the other one is people want a clinical platform, and that is clinical operations and clinical data management. And that's not something you can get from the existing leaders in the clinical data management area. So that then the customer has to develop a common data architecture between their clinical operations and their clinical data management from two different vendors. They have to develop the integrations. They have to keep those integrations running as the both products change. And that's really a headache that people don't want to deal with. So I would say it's those things that are contributing. And you might ask, well, how come everybody is not buying it all today that well, customers have priorities, and this is changing a very, very critical system, and you better have a good reason to do it. You don't do it unless you have pain in that area and not all customers have pain all at the same time.\nCraig Hettenbach: Helpful. Thank you.\nPeter Gassner: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anne Samuel with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAnne Samuel: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping to go back to the earlier question around optimism. We've heard from some others in the industry that the annual budget flush did happen to some extent late in the quarter. Just curious, did you see that at all? And maybe any other notable green shoots that you can point to that are maybe driving your comments around optimism in the space? Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: I guess I can take that one. For the budget flush, we don't really see that too much because ours are more critical and complex things, not so much discretionary. So we don't -- we just don't really see that as much. That may have happened. We just don't see it as much. And then in terms of the optimism overall, it's -- I want everybody to be clear, this is based on a feeling on intuition based on lots of discussions. So we have deep relationships with the customers because we have big strategic partnerships. So that's all. There's no -- I can't calculate it down into science. It's -- you know it when you feel it, and we feel it, but there's no -- you can't really quantify that.\nAnne Samuel: Thanks very much.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nKelly Valenti: Hi. This is Kelly Valenti on for Gabriela. A question for me. Would be great to get an update on any impacts you're noticing in the industry due to any regulatory changes, particularly as biopharma companies think about potential future impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act and how that might change the way they invest? And then also just how customers are thinking about the risks associated with the upcoming election and how you're thinking about any potential impact?\nPaul Shawah: Yes. Kelly, this is Paul. So I guess the way to think about regulations, and particularly, you brought up specifically the IRA. Our customers are certainly thinking about it, and they're thinking about it, first and foremost, on the drug development side because that's the long cycle in terms of what that starts to impact. The decisions that they make today around where the -- which kinds of molecules they're going to invest in small molecules, large molecules, which indications they're going to try to get approval for. Those are the kinds of things that will have an impact as it relates to the IRA. So those decisions and those thinking is happening now. So I would say that it's more acute on the R&D side than it is on the commercial side. From a commercial standpoint the -- it doesn't really hit until 2026, and then it's somewhat gradual and it's somewhat focused and acute on specific companies. So more thinking and more action on R&D. And I think over time, it will start to impact more of the commercial side. But companies are responding. They're making decisions. They're making changes, and they're also innovating. You heard some of the optimism around the science and the innovation of the new medicines. So I think there's also a lot of optimism that the industry will continue to innovate and kind of drive through some of the negative or the potential headwinds of IRA. In terms of other things like elections and kind of other regulatory changes, those things are generally -- this is a generalization, but they're generally neutral to net positive because when you modernize and you become more digital, you generally need to -- it helps companies become more agile. When regulations are put in place, you need to comply, you may need to change, and drive change management. And that usually is to the benefit of becoming more digital and using technology to comply with regulation. So it's kind of a generic answer, but hopefully, that gives you a sense of how we think about it and what we typically see.\nKelly Valenti: Very helpful color. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jailendra Singh with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nJailendra Singh: Thank you and thanks for taking my questions. I have a couple of clarification questions on your macro commentary. First, a quick clarification on the services side. You seem to be indicating that the environment has been largely unchanged since your last earnings call. But one of the factors you called out in your lower outlook for service its project timing. So have time lines been getting more elongated? Or is it more that your expectations from some of these projects coming back is now pushed out a little bit?\nBrent Bowman: I mean it's -- so what we said was it hasn't gotten worse or better in the last 90 days. So we did see an impact, obviously, in services, we talked about 90 days ago. So that has continued a bit on the project timing side. So that is what has largely driven the services reduction that we talked about in our guide. That was the primary driver. And there's a couple of other items that we contemplated into the implementation excellence as well as some of the investments we're making. So if you take all of that together, that's what's informing our guide and the slight reduction that we had.\nJailendra Singh: Okay. And then one quick follow-up on the R&D spending. Clearly, I think it's very well-known that a lot of R&D dollars are going in, obviously, weight loss GLP-1 area and even you flagged that our understanding is pharma companies might be doing a decent chunk of these trials in-house versus outsourcing to CROs. Do you think those R&D dollar allocation to in-house trial is providing some tailwinds for your Development Cloud business?\nPeter Gassner: I think I haven't seen a dramatic shift in-source versus outsourcing on trials that goes back and forth. So I haven't seen a dramatic change. And right now I think we -- that doesn't really affect our business too much the in-source or the outsource. If they outsource, maybe we can pick it up to the CRO. And the big companies, they're always going to in-source a lot of their trials anyway. So it doesn't really affect us right now.\nJailendra Singh: All right. Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brad Sills at Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBradley Sills: Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask about the Data Cloud. Peter, it looks like some pretty exciting releases here of enhancements here, the prescriber and Compass National. Could you just elaborate on those? It seems like no better time than the presence to come to market with a revamped data cloud. So what are you excited about there? And how could that cycle augment growth?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. I am excited about it. And I think the timing is great. There hasn't been a new entrance in that market for that type of data really for that projected data for more than 15 years since Veeva started. And it's critical data. It's used for segmentation and targeting, field force sizing, how big is your field team? Who are you going to call on the tactics that you're going to use, use for incentive compensation, business planning, critical things. And I feel like we're we had a vision when we bought Crossix, say we would get Crossix. It has a data network. We like the Crossix business. We can grow it and we can add more data sources, grow that data network and use that to really do something innovative in data around Compass. And we stuck to the plan, and I'm proud of over the last couple of years, we've always taken the innovative approach on Compass, not the easy approach of copying what's out there. And so now it's coming to fruition and it feels great. It just feels like when we start involved. It's innovative so that only one out of 20 people really get it, right? Because it's innovative and it's different and it's, well, what is this? But I think the facts are on our side. So I think the timing couldn't be better, and I'm really happy with the team we have. And I'm really happy we have some happy early customers. But I don't want to get out ahead of our skis with prescriber and national, we just released them in the end of January, gosh. So we released the December data set in the end of January. That's a long way from having happy customers that are using it for a year, paying incentive compensation on it, really happy with the product and the service but that's the hard work we got to do over the next year. But if we execute, I think the future is pretty bright.\nBradley Sills: That's great, Peter. One more, if I may, please, on the Commercial Cloud. I understand that you're going through the transition here to the new platform. It sounds like while that's going on, that will weigh on the ability to cross-sell some of these newer solutions, should we take that to mean once you're kind of through that transition, I guess, 1.5 years, 2 years from now, maybe that's optimistic. But at that point, you will have the opportunity to better cross-sell and upsell some of these newer solutions in the suite and maybe we're due for a reacceleration at that point?\nPeter Gassner: Well, in terms of -- we will have the re-acceleration, I don't want to make any projections out that far. But certainly, the ability to cross-sell will start opening up in the next within two years or so, but that will then gradually open up, right? Because there'll still be customers using Veeva CRM in 2028, I think, hopefully, by 2029. And certainly, by 2030, they'll be all migrated, so it's the correct way to think about it, this re-platforming, you think about it, since we're in the life sciences industry, you could think about it as a strong medicine that Veeva has to take for the industry, right, to do this to the re-platforming. It's not a positive to the revenue in the short term, but it's the right thing and it will be a positive to the revenue in the long term. For example, this marketing automation that we're building, I think it could be extra, extra, extra innovative because it will be life sciences specific, it will be regionally aware which is the way you do this stuff in Japan and Germany and the US is quite different in life sciences. And it will be aware of the field, the sales team. So you could use our marketing automation to inform your sales team of marketing for sure, but let your sales team control some part of marketing or you could use a campaign to control your sales team because they're all operating on the same date of the same segment. So it's like having Marketo inside of Salesforce.com and industry specific. That's not been done before. So as you can tell, I'm excited about the future, and we'll be able to show some of these products at our Customer Summit in May, especially the call center one, the service center is really coming along. So I'm really happy about it. But, yes, we've got to take this medicine for three or four years, and it doesn't taste good right now. How about that?\nBradley Sills: Understood, Peter. Well, thanks for the optimistic view on the longer-term exiting that.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCharles Rhyee: Thanks for squeezing me in. Really just some follow-up questions, maybe for Brent on just the guidance then. Obviously, op margins, you're guiding sort of 38% in the first quarter, full year, more like 39%. Any color you can give in terms of how we should think of cadence for margins through the course of the year? And then secondly, in the subscription revenue guidance, how much of that is already contracted at this point? And how much maybe do you need to win over the course of the year? Thank you.\nPeter Gassner: Yes. What I would say on the -- regarding the op income op margin, we feel -- again, we provided guidance for the full year in Q1. There's always going to be a little bit of movement between quarters. But overall, we feel really good about how we're executing in the efficiency that we have. So I'm not going to provide any additional color on how Q2, Q3 and the slope of that curve. But just know that we're executing well, and we feel good about those numbers. Then your other -- your secondary question, sorry, I didn't write it down. It was around subscription?\nCharles Rhyee: In the subscription revenue guidance, how much of that is already contracted versus how much you maybe need to win through the course of the year?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. What I would say is our visibility is at least equally as good, if not better than it was in previous times. So we have visibility and the part of that continues to get informed as we close more business and we have these ramping deals. So visibility is at least as good as we've had in the past.\nCharles Rhyee: Okay, I appreciate that. Thanks so much.\nPeter Gassner: Yeah, thank you.\nOperator: I'll now hand the call back to Peter Gassner for any closing remarks.\nPeter Gassner: First off, thanks to everybody who asked these really thoughtful or insightful question, thanks for your interest in Veeva and your understanding of Veeva. The good questions help everybody have more clarity. I really appreciate that. And then I'd like to close by thanking our customers for their trust and partnership and the Veeva team for all the work in the year and that I believe will have a major impact on the industry and drive our growth for years to come. Thank you.",

            "name": "Brent Bowman",
            "content": "Yes. I understand. Thanks, Saket. So real pleased that how we exited fiscal year '24, exceeding our billings guide, so executing well there. And if you think about the EDC wins, by way of example, we're still pretty early days, as Peter said, so five of those top eight wins have been in the last 12 months. So we're still early in that ramping phase. So they're contributing. They're contributing more in fiscal year '25 than they did in fiscal year '24. And those eight will continue to contribute more as we look out forward. Yes, Ken, overall, philosophically, there's no change to how we approach guidance. There's obviously a number of variables in play, whether it's the macro and the impact and how that's impacting our service or our subs business on billings, you got things like duration and frequency. So we kind of take a step back and look at all those variables, and we think we've taken a prudent approach holistically given the variables at hand. So not a fundamental change in how we guide. Yes. Overall, Brian, continuing to our current capital allocation strategy, no change. We run a profitable business. We generate a lot of cash. So we are focused on M&A as a use of that cash. And we are a disciplined company, and we'll take a disciplined approach to how we look at M&A. We do consider other uses of cash as a management leadership team, but our focus today is M&A. Thanks, Brian. Yes. So what I would say is I wouldn't interpret the choice of words of prudent as there's this incremental level of conservatism that's baked into the guide. I guess I would start there. We've considered all the factors that we've talked about on the call today. And we've considered those and we think we have a guide that's reflective of the best calls of the numbers like we have historically. So I would think of it that way. There's a number of items to contemplate in like the services portion of the business, which can be a little bit lumpy at that business. But overall, we feel really good and have conviction on the numbers we provided. I can take the first portion of that on the -- on your question around rep reductions. There's -- the digital portion of those rep reductions, that's largely behind us. So there's I wouldn't think of that as an incremental headwind as you look at fiscal year '25. Okay. Yes, I'm happy to. So maybe just first taking a big step back, so we provided $1 billion plus guide about a year ago, which is a bit not typical, and we wanted to provide some context around the TFC standardization. So now you fast forward 12 months, and from that, we've been executing well, right? We've been executing over the past year. And the 39% reflects that. And that reflects our operating model and the efficiency and effectiveness we get out of our operating model, and also the power and efficiency of the Vault platform. So it really comes down to that. We're making the investments we see are necessary to drive customer success and growth. We're not short changing those. And -- but overall, it's just about execution. Yes, and I would say, overall, the margin uplift we're seeing isn't really driven by services. I would say it's really a more broad thing. It's broadly how we're executing and that's how we leverage again our operating model, thinking about lean teams and really disciplined hiring broadly. So we feel good about how we've executed there. And that's basically what's informed our guide for the full fiscal year. I'm not going to talk beyond fiscal year '25 at this point in time. But we feel good about our ability to hit those operating income and our margin targets. I mean it's -- so what we said was it hasn't gotten worse or better in the last 90 days. So we did see an impact, obviously, in services, we talked about 90 days ago. So that has continued a bit on the project timing side. So that is what has largely driven the services reduction that we talked about in our guide. That was the primary driver. And there's a couple of other items that we contemplated into the implementation excellence as well as some of the investments we're making. So if you take all of that together, that's what's informing our guide and the slight reduction that we had."

            "name": "Peter Gassner",
            "content": "Thank you, Gunnar, and welcome everyone to the call. It was a great quarter and year of execution for Veeva with strength across the business and results above our guidance. Total revenue in the quarter was $631 million with non-GAAP operating income of $239 million. For the year, total revenue was $2.4 billion and non-GAAP operating income was $843 million. This past year was important in many ways for Veeva and the industry. And I'm proud of all the team accomplished. We delivered the Veeva Compass Suite, giving the industry a better alternative to legacy data. We established the clinical platform and progressed on our new commercial cloud. It was a milestone year that I think we'll look back on as one of the most significant. We'll now open up the call to your question. I'll take that one and then Paul, maybe you can join in as well. There's no major change in our strategy. It's just a refinement as things get closer into view. We've decided and have been able to provide a little more internal guidance about how much investment we'll make in Vault CRM related services. We think it's just the right thing to do. It's not -- moving to Vault CRM wasn't anything our customers asked for. They were happy with Veeva CRM. We're going to bring them a better solution over time, an integrated solution with the sales, marketing and medical, all industry-specific all in the same database. But it wasn't anything really they were asking for or budgeting for. So we really want to do the right thing by those customers because remember, Vault CRM is just -- that's just one of the things that we have with those customers. We have big customer relationships and Vault CRM is just one of the things. So we want to help them through that. So no real change and Paul, in terms of progress with top 20 type CRM customers, maybe you can give an update? Yes, I'll take that one. So if you -- if we step back just for a high level and how the business breaks down, overall, the TAM is about $20 billion, right? So it's a big TAM, and we're less than 15% penetrated. So we got a long way to go. That's important to remember that. It's a long-term thing that this is going to be a growing and profitable business for many years. And then the other thing is quite durable because these products are critical products and they're complex products. They're not things like e-mail or something like that. And then we have a lot of products that fit together. So with that, with that context, I think it's relevant to look at the different parts. And you can really break it down into three parts from sort of a revenue perspective, the Development Cloud, the R&D area. That's the biggest one. It's about 50% of our revenue right now, and it's about 65% of our overall opportunity, and it's growing roughly 20% or so and that will really grow well into the foreseeable future. And because we have a lot of new products, we have a clear competitive advantage there, and these are mission-critical systems. Now what you mentioned, Joe, is customers don't rush in these areas. These are critical systems. They don't rush and these are some long-term programs. So for example, a couple of these wins that we had they will roll out and they will get to full revenue four and five years from now. So yes, the fiscal impact comes much later. One thing important to remember about 10 years ago, when we were going public, Development Cloud, that was quite a bit less than 5% of our revenue, and now it's over 40% and still growing in the 20%. So that's Development Cloud. And then you've got this -- the other areas like our CRM and the add-ons, we kind of call that the CRM Suite. And in that area, the revenue is stable. It's not really growing because of two things. One, we have really high market share and happy customers on our core CRM or Veeva CRM and some of the add-ons. And then we need to migrate those customers to Vault CRM before we can sell the new add-on products like marketing automation and service centers. So that's kind of a stable 25%. And then the other 25% roughly is a mix of other things in commercial. And if we call that other commercial, this is some stable things like commercial content and Crossix where we are the market leaders, but we continue to grow at a moderate and steady pace and customer success is really high with those products. And then newer products like Link and Compass. And these are small now, but they're growing rapidly on a percentage basis, and they have high potential if we can execute well. Now we have to remain seen if we can execute well. So overall, this other commercial area that I talked about, that's growing roughly 15% or so now, and that can continue to grow into the foreseeable future as well. So I thought it was good to just give that background on how to look at the business overall. Thank you. Yes. I think there's a little more optimism. The science is going well. And we've had this disruption of conflicts and interest rates for a while now and people are getting kind of used to it. So there's a little more optimism. Of course, things could change. I think that will translate into a bit more projects that get thought about this year, especially towards the end of the year. But a lot of that time, those things get kicked off in the following year. So a lot of our projects, you just don't wake up one day and say, hey, let me redo my drug safety system. Now it's these are big projects. There's some change management and there's some thought into it. But overall, I like the feeling that I feel from the industry right now. Thanks. Let's see. How to think about that. On the EDC, when we sell EDC field, there's really two types. One would be an enterprise deal and that's where we agree, hey, it's a long term, it's enterprise agreements that will ramp over time. And over time, you'll run all your studies on Veeva. And that doesn't -- the revenue for that doesn't change based on how fast they ramp or whether they migrate or whether they don't migrate. Then we have other ones which are study-by-study costs where sometimes it's with a CRO or a small biotech, they may be only running one or two or three studies, and we may compete for that study and win that study. the migration really won't impact our revenue directly at all. What it is, is, let's say, if a customer signs up for an enterprise agreement with ours, and they're rolling out and they're quite comfortable with Veeva. They might get to a point where they have 20, 30 studies that will run for a long time, and they want to clean up their IT environment, and they want to have a consistent clinical research site experience. So they use our migration tools to clean that up rather than having some straggling studies on the legacy technology for honestly, what could be three, four, five years. And that gets brittle who knows what could happen with that straggling vendor, whether it has a downtime security patch needs to be put on, whatever it is. It's just not clean. So that migration capability actually translates into an advantage in our enterprise sales because we have that capability and nobody else really has that capability. So it would only have an effect there. It doesn't really affect in the small market where we're competing study by study. Thanks. I guess I can take that one. I would say this is diversified, more diversified. We had some quality wins and those were with certain customers. We had a big clinical operations win for multiple clinical operations products. That was with a customer in Europe. We have a couple of EDC of top 20 and those were actually with different customers. So, no, it's spread all around, I think, it's the best way to say it, both in US. and Europe and just different customers. Rishi, I would say the most direct impact, and it's been happening a while before large language models as well as AI and drug discovery. Very, very targeted AI models that can do things like protein folding and analyzing retina images, things like that. So this is -- this is very powerful, but very therapeutic area specific, very close to the science in the R&D, and I -- there's not just one AI model there is multiple specialized AI models. So that's going on, and that will continue. I would say that's kind of part of the fabric of the industry now. Then in terms of other areas, really, there's a lot of experimentation with large language models. And what people look at it for are a) Can I just have general productivity for my people? Can they write an e-mail faster? Can they check their e-mail faster? Can they research some information faster? So that's one thing that's going on. Also, specific use cases like authoring, can I -- can I author a protocol faster? Can I author a regulatory document faster? Now faster is one thing, but also have to be very accurate. So I would say there's experimentation on that. there's not yet broad production use on that. And certainly, some of these critical things has to read a lot of quality control on it. So those are probably the two biggest use cases. Really three. Research, general productivity and authoring. And then as far as our rule, we've been doing some really heavy work over the last two years on something in our Vault platform that's called the Direct Data API. And that's a pretty revolutionary way of making the data come out of fault in a consistent -- transactionally consistent manner much, much faster, roughly 100 times faster than it happens now. That's going to be critical for all kinds of AI applications on the top, which we may develop, which our customers may develop, and we're also utilizing that from some really fast system to system transfer between our different Vault family. So that's been the biggest thing that we've done. We haven't really invested heavily in large language models. So far, we just don't see quite the application in our application areas, not to say that, that wouldn't change in the future. I would, I guess, I would say we're in a pretty good position because AI really -- the durable thing about AI is the data sources, the data sources. The AI models will come on top, and that will be largely a tech commodity, but the control and the access to the data sources, that's pretty important, and that's kind of where Veeva plays. Yes. Now that's the specifics of that customer, of course, I won't go into the exact specifics here, but I can quickly give you my thoughts on it. I would say there that customer had eTMF, and that's one of our larger applications and has had for a number of years, fully deployed that one. When they got the other four applications in clinical operations, they more than tripled our opportunity, our end-state in clinical operations. So in that case. And I won't go into the exact numbers, but I know it's more than tripled. So it's significant. When you look at the CTMS, the clinical trial management system, that's a really important system study training, really important system for training thousands of research sites around the world and maintaining compliance and doing that in a friendly and friendly way. The payments processing. That's another thing that's key, the processing the payments out to the clinical research sites and then our product called Site Connect, which is about automating the information flow from the sites to the research, sorry, from the sites to the pharma company. During the start-up, during the conduct of the study and also critically at the end of the study, things that are called end-of-study media that have to get out to the site and we're doing that in an automated way. So there's a ton of value there that more than triples our value of eTMF. And I would say last comment that customer won't always be like that where a customer says, hey, we just really want to modernize clinical operations, and we're looking to this partner to do it, and we're going to do it in a holistic way over a number of years across a number of products. What's more common is there's a need in a certain area, study training. The study training group has a need, hey, let's use Veeva or the payments group has a need, hey, let's use Veeva. That's still the more common use case. Yes. It's very early. It's a good question, especially well, Compass patients, but especially prescriber and national, these are quite innovative products. So it's going to take a while for customers to understand and adopt these. It's almost like going from the cloud sorry, from client server to cloud. It's sort of, well, it's a different way of doing things. So the reaction from the customers has first been for some, they're busy and they're not interested. For some, they are like, oh, I want to look into this. And then when they look into this, like, well, wow, this is really different. And they have to absorb that a little bit. This is really different, and then for some early adopters, they have jumped on like, wow, I can target physicians that I've never been able to target before. I can see data on my competitors' products that are administered in the medical setting, not a retail product, I can see that down to the ZIP code level and the HCP level. And I can see things like unattributed scripts that where we don't -- where the -- the health, the doctor is not specified, but they can see the health system. These are things that were just not possible before. So and for a long time, not possible for really 20 years here. So now it's the process of wow, that data is available, what should I do with that data? How can I optimize? So it's -- it's going to take some time, and it's for early adopters, which will generally come in innovative companies coming to market. They don't have any existing infrastructure and they're innovative type people and hey, let's just go for that. And then what we've had is some brands in large companies that are small brands, pre-commercial brands, and they're thinking, wow, I can -- they have some freedom and latitude to go off and do what they do. And they're getting this new data set, then, okay, we'll go for that. We're the hardest ones and what just takes time, the well, the big established brands, right? Because they have a motion, and it's going and it's working. Very reticent to disrupt that because they have a limited patent life of these products, and they don't want to be risky in there. So that's a little bit of color of what we're seeing. I believe we're taking share, yes. What's happened is we just continue to track record of customer success, just sort of grind it out all the customers are successful with Crossix, our data network for what we're doing there is the largest and most applicable. So I think bring some boom times. There was a little more experimentation with other areas. Some people got their fingers burned a little bit. And I think that we haven't. We haven't burned anybody fingers. So customer success leads the way. I think that's the main thing. I'll take that one. This is Peter. The emerging biotechs, the small center of the segment is still a tough sliding there. This year, we saw a record number of companies get acquired and go out of business. And a small number of new companies were able to get escape velocity because of the funding environment, it's tough, and it continues to be tough. And you never know when it turns around until it turns around, all you know is that it hasn't turned around yet. Then in the top 50, I would say the feeling is just kind of a bit resigned that, hey, we're in for this -- there's some global conflicts, there's inflation, there's IRA Act, but that hasn't hurt us too bad yet, so we could just keep going. Also there's -- I think there's a renewed focus on execution and long-term execution. They're really seeing that that's important. I think there's some excitement about the science as well. Like, for example, we have some really big brands now in the city area. That's something that didn't exist three, four years ago. And so that's renewing people's optimism like, wow, the science will lead the way. So it's really different in the top 50 versus the emerging biotechs. Yes. I can talk to the general philosophy of M&A. I think it's no secret, I can just give you the formula. First of all, it has to make some business sense with the market. It has to be a market that we're interested to go in, either it's complementary or somewhat adjacent to what we're doing. So that would be number one. It has to have a cultural fit with the company that you're considering acquiring because otherwise, it just absolutely will not work. And 80% of acquisitions fail. But at Veeva, we've had all of our acquisitions succeed. So it's this discipline. The cultural fit is a real thing, and it's an indicator of many things, not that our culture is the best culture or whatever, but a company that doesn't fit with our culture, it will not be a successful acquisition. Third, you need to have a very clear product and organizational structure plan that's been thought out ahead of time so that you could announce it to both teams from the day you would acquire them. If that doesn't happen, it's an indicator that you don't have enough bench strength to operate this thing. And therefore, you'll lose it in the integration or the business strategy isn't actually clear because you can't say it to people. So in that, I think those are the parameters. So I don't think we would be limited by size. If we saw something that was right that hit those parameters and that would cost us $3 billion more than we would go for that. But the other thing you need to is you need a willing seller. And so it's timing of it. And that's why 80% of acquisitions fail is because people rush in and they buy things that don't fit these parameters. We're just not going to do that. I would rather return money to shareholders than wasted on a failed acquisition. Thanks. Yes, I would just say we're -- this is Peter. We're -- as we scale, I think we're getting a little more efficient is getting more efficient in our processes, in our customer relationships and our use of our Vault platform, and we're being diligent. That was a concept we call lean teams. Not doing layoffs, but we want lean teams. We want the smallest teams possible with high-performance people that could perform well together. So this kind of discipline that's why our margins are increasing. And I think you'll see that from us increasing margins over time. I think most of these things that we deal with, we have very little discretionary stand other than in services, right, because we deal with these critical systems and complex system and they have more thinking time. They have -- they have more thinking time. So I just don't think it's stuff that would impact this year. And having said that, we don't know what's going to happen this year. We do live in some uncertain times. We have some interest rate things going on. We've got two global conflicts going on. So we have to figure that uncertainty. Again, it's not a guarantee that in September, everything is going to be the same as it is right now. Okay. In terms of data acquisition, yes, we make end data products that we sell to our customers. And of course, we buy data inputs, call it data acquisitions. We have a pretty unique strategy as it relates to Compass, where we're really multi-sourcing. We're sourcing data from a lot of different sources, and we have really excellent industry-leading patient tokenization process that's kind of fundamentally different than the common one out there. So when we do this, we can multisource from a lot of different places bring it together and avoid duplicates. So when we do that, we'll have more data sources than what's common, but no data source will be particularly extra critical to us. So when we see a good deal for a data source and a good set of terms, which means we can contract it for a number of years, and we know what the cost is and it's not that expensive. We'll do that. And if we see something that's not good, such as, hey, we don't have stability over multiple years or the cost is too high than we want to pay, then we just won't purchase that. So you're not going to see anything dramatic from Veeva. There's no step function in cost or something like that. Very importantly for us, these data acquisitions, they power both our Crossix business and our Compass business. So that's very different, right? With one set of data purchases, we're able to power two good-sized businesses. And so that lowers our percentage data cost I don't know that one. I probably -- if I do some research, I can figure out what Annex 1 is, but we'll have to get back to you. We can get back to you offline as long as it's not a material non-public thing. So sorry about that one. You stumped me on that one. I can only really comment on our strategy. I wouldn't really know exactly as it compares to others. We believe we have a lower overall beta cost because of this. That's what we believe. Now the main reason to do this is for data quality. So if you're getting data from three different sources, that they're somewhat overlapping, you have a better chance of getting data quality. And this is one of the reasons why we can project data for medical claims, which is -- it might be something that's done at an infusion center. We can also project something for something that you pick up at Walgreens or CVS. Why? Well, because we're sourcing data from multiple points along the line. So the real benefit is more holistic view of the patient, we can project data for over 4,000 brands. And you can only do that. You can't do that if you're just projecting based on a few large retailers' data, you can't do that because if you look at 20 years ago or 25 when these legacy data products were started, or even when Veeva started in 2007, the biggest brand at the time was Lipitor and you've got Lipitor at the drugstore. Biggest brand now is KEYTRUDA. And you don't just walk into the drugstore and get that. It doesn't work that way or HUMIRA, et cetera. So ours is a modern approach that I think is the only way really to do it well for today's complex therapies. And I do think we'll have lower data cost over time. I do think that, but I don't have a proof of that. Yes. Now as it relates to change, I am we're aware of that, of course, not the very specific details of the attack. I am aware of how the attack was made, but I'm not aware of the -- what's going on inside the change. But and I'm not going to disclose whether we get data from them or not. But yes, it is a switch. Now the good thing that happens here for the health care system most of the pharmacies are operating on relatively modern software such that they can point their software to different switches and there are standards that are in play. So that's a good thing that the health care system can recover. For us, again, without going into a lot of details, whichever way the data gets routed, there's a real good chance we're going to pick it up because we're picking it up in multiple places along the way. So I'm not -- even if we were at scale in our business, I would -- it's certainly unfortunate what happened with change, and I think it's terrible what's going on with the cyber tax, but it wouldn't affect our Compass or Crossix business. Thank you. Well, as we get into this middle part of the market, I think a required thing would be positive customer references, right? If we -- our existing customers weren't happy and productive these current sales would not be happening because it is very easy for them to reach out to their peers and get a very authentic, hey, you're using Veeva today. How are you feeling about that? So I would say our customer success is leading the way. And then in terms of capabilities, it's agile study build to be able to build a complex study that has multiple arms quicker and more reliably. That's a big benefit. I would say the sort of what I would say, no coding. A lot of the existing -- at least a couple of the existing providers actually end up doing a lot of coding, actual coding work when you build a study. Now that is interesting for whoever is coding that study, but it's a bit of a headache for the people managing the study because when you have coding it's hard to keep that under control and the complexity grows and there can be errors and unforeseen things. So with Veeva, you don't do the custom coding, I would say the other one is people want a clinical platform, and that is clinical operations and clinical data management. And that's not something you can get from the existing leaders in the clinical data management area. So that then the customer has to develop a common data architecture between their clinical operations and their clinical data management from two different vendors. They have to develop the integrations. They have to keep those integrations running as the both products change. And that's really a headache that people don't want to deal with. So I would say it's those things that are contributing. And you might ask, well, how come everybody is not buying it all today that well, customers have priorities, and this is changing a very, very critical system, and you better have a good reason to do it. You don't do it unless you have pain in that area and not all customers have pain all at the same time. Thanks. I guess I can take that one. For the budget flush, we don't really see that too much because ours are more critical and complex things, not so much discretionary. So we don't -- we just don't really see that as much. That may have happened. We just don't see it as much. And then in terms of the optimism overall, it's -- I want everybody to be clear, this is based on a feeling on intuition based on lots of discussions. So we have deep relationships with the customers because we have big strategic partnerships. So that's all. There's no -- I can't calculate it down into science. It's -- you know it when you feel it, and we feel it, but there's no -- you can't really quantify that. Thank you. I think I haven't seen a dramatic shift in-source versus outsourcing on trials that goes back and forth. So I haven't seen a dramatic change. And right now I think we -- that doesn't really affect our business too much the in-source or the outsource. If they outsource, maybe we can pick it up to the CRO. And the big companies, they're always going to in-source a lot of their trials anyway. So it doesn't really affect us right now. Yes. I am excited about it. And I think the timing is great. There hasn't been a new entrance in that market for that type of data really for that projected data for more than 15 years since Veeva started. And it's critical data. It's used for segmentation and targeting, field force sizing, how big is your field team? Who are you going to call on the tactics that you're going to use, use for incentive compensation, business planning, critical things. And I feel like we're we had a vision when we bought Crossix, say we would get Crossix. It has a data network. We like the Crossix business. We can grow it and we can add more data sources, grow that data network and use that to really do something innovative in data around Compass. And we stuck to the plan, and I'm proud of over the last couple of years, we've always taken the innovative approach on Compass, not the easy approach of copying what's out there. And so now it's coming to fruition and it feels great. It just feels like when we start involved. It's innovative so that only one out of 20 people really get it, right? Because it's innovative and it's different and it's, well, what is this? But I think the facts are on our side. So I think the timing couldn't be better, and I'm really happy with the team we have. And I'm really happy we have some happy early customers. But I don't want to get out ahead of our skis with prescriber and national, we just released them in the end of January, gosh. So we released the December data set in the end of January. That's a long way from having happy customers that are using it for a year, paying incentive compensation on it, really happy with the product and the service but that's the hard work we got to do over the next year. But if we execute, I think the future is pretty bright. Well, in terms of -- we will have the re-acceleration, I don't want to make any projections out that far. But certainly, the ability to cross-sell will start opening up in the next within two years or so, but that will then gradually open up, right? Because there'll still be customers using Veeva CRM in 2028, I think, hopefully, by 2029. And certainly, by 2030, they'll be all migrated, so it's the correct way to think about it, this re-platforming, you think about it, since we're in the life sciences industry, you could think about it as a strong medicine that Veeva has to take for the industry, right, to do this to the re-platforming. It's not a positive to the revenue in the short term, but it's the right thing and it will be a positive to the revenue in the long term. For example, this marketing automation that we're building, I think it could be extra, extra, extra innovative because it will be life sciences specific, it will be regionally aware which is the way you do this stuff in Japan and Germany and the US is quite different in life sciences. And it will be aware of the field, the sales team. So you could use our marketing automation to inform your sales team of marketing for sure, but let your sales team control some part of marketing or you could use a campaign to control your sales team because they're all operating on the same date of the same segment. So it's like having Marketo inside of Salesforce.com and industry specific. That's not been done before. So as you can tell, I'm excited about the future, and we'll be able to show some of these products at our Customer Summit in May, especially the call center one, the service center is really coming along. So I'm really happy about it. But, yes, we've got to take this medicine for three or four years, and it doesn't taste good right now. How about that? Thank you. Yes. What I would say on the -- regarding the op income op margin, we feel -- again, we provided guidance for the full year in Q1. There's always going to be a little bit of movement between quarters. But overall, we feel really good about how we're executing in the efficiency that we have. So I'm not going to provide any additional color on how Q2, Q3 and the slope of that curve. But just know that we're executing well, and we feel good about those numbers. Then your other -- your secondary question, sorry, I didn't write it down. It was around subscription? Yes. What I would say is our visibility is at least equally as good, if not better than it was in previous times. So we have visibility and the part of that continues to get informed as we close more business and we have these ramping deals. So visibility is at least as good as we've had in the past. Yeah, thank you. First off, thanks to everybody who asked these really thoughtful or insightful question, thanks for your interest in Veeva and your understanding of Veeva. The good questions help everybody have more clarity. I really appreciate that. And then I'd like to close by thanking our customers for their trust and partnership and the Veeva team for all the work in the year and that I believe will have a major impact on the industry and drive our growth for years to come. Thank you."

            "name": "Paul Shawah",
            "content": "Yes, Joe, thanks for the question. We're progressing well with our top 20 customers. Really, all of our customers pleased to announce that we -- you heard us announce two top 20 global commitments. We announced that last quarter. I'm pleased to announce a third moving their existing Veeva CRM footprint. They're committing to move all of that over to Vault CRM so now this is three top 20 pharmas. So that's just another example of the kinds of progress that we're making. We're also in deep conversation with all of the rest of top 20 and many other customers. And those conversations are progressing well, given the innovation that Peter has talked about. We're doing something fundamentally different integrating sales and marketing and medical in a very tight and unique way. So I'm optimistic you'll hear more about top 20s over time committing to Vault CRM. Yes, Ryan, I can take that. This is Paul. So the conversations we have with all of these customers, it's a dialogue. We go in with full transparency. We talk about why they want to choose one or the other. We don't go in with a preconceived notion. We listen and talk to the customer. And then based on what their requirements are, we guide them. We try to lead the customer and make sure we make the right decision. There may be reasons to do Veeva CRM that includes some very specific features and functions that they really need early on that they want to start there with that would be a common example of why they may choose Veeva CRM of Vault CRM, but those things are going away quickly. Just to give you a perspective, we'll be a general availability in April. We're well on the way and on track for that and at full parity with everything in Veeva CRM will be in Vault CRM by the end of this year. So it's really a timing issue. And starting in April, everything will be Vault. And we're comfortable and confident in that time line and that milestone. So that gives you some guidance there. In terms of the -- how we're contracting, we're contracting in a very similar way. There's not really a material change. So the licensing is not exactly the same, but it's very similar. And then in terms of timing of contracts, it's pretty much all the same, annual deals that we do, and it's all per user base. Yes. Kelly, this is Paul. So I guess the way to think about regulations, and particularly, you brought up specifically the IRA. Our customers are certainly thinking about it, and they're thinking about it, first and foremost, on the drug development side because that's the long cycle in terms of what that starts to impact. The decisions that they make today around where the -- which kinds of molecules they're going to invest in small molecules, large molecules, which indications they're going to try to get approval for. Those are the kinds of things that will have an impact as it relates to the IRA. So those decisions and those thinking is happening now. So I would say that it's more acute on the R&D side than it is on the commercial side. From a commercial standpoint the -- it doesn't really hit until 2026, and then it's somewhat gradual and it's somewhat focused and acute on specific companies. So more thinking and more action on R&D. And I think over time, it will start to impact more of the commercial side. But companies are responding. They're making decisions. They're making changes, and they're also innovating. You heard some of the optimism around the science and the innovation of the new medicines. So I think there's also a lot of optimism that the industry will continue to innovate and kind of drive through some of the negative or the potential headwinds of IRA. In terms of other things like elections and kind of other regulatory changes, those things are generally -- this is a generalization, but they're generally neutral to net positive because when you modernize and you become more digital, you generally need to -- it helps companies become more agile. When regulations are put in place, you need to comply, you may need to change, and drive change management. And that usually is to the benefit of becoming more digital and using technology to comply with regulation. So it's kind of a generic answer, but hopefully, that gives you a sense of how we think about it and what we typically see."

        "content": "Operator: Good day. My name is Krista, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Veeva Systems Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions].  I will now turn the conference over to Gunnar Hansen, Director, Investor Relations. Gunnar, you may begin your conference. \nGunnar Hansen : Good afternoon, and welcome to Veeva's fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call for the quarter ended October 31, 2023. As a reminder, we posted prepared remarks on Veeva's Investor Relations website just after 1:00 PM Pacific today. We hope you have had a chance to read them before the call. Today's call will be used primarily for Q&A. With me today for Q&A are Peter Gassner, our Chief Executive Officer; Paul Shawah, Veeva Commercial Strategy; and Brent Bowman, our Chief Financial Officer.  During this call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding trends, our strategies and the anticipated performance of the business, including guidance regarding future financial results. These forward-looking statements will be based on our current views and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the risks listed in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our most recent filing on Form 10-Q. Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today, December 6, 2023, and based on the facts available to us today. If this call is replayed or viewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Veeva disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We may discuss our guidance on today's call, but we will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public form.  On the call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today's earnings release and in the supplemental investor presentation, both of which are available on our website.  With that, thank you for joining us, and I'll turn the call over to Peter. \nPeter Gassner: Thank you, Gunnar, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We have solid Q3 with revenue and operating income ahead of guidance, including total revenue of $617 million and GAAP operating income of $235 million. As I shared in our prepared remarks, we had a number of great milestones and new product announcements in the quarter as we progressed in building our industry cloud for life sciences. With the growing set of high-value applications, data and services in R&D and commercial, we can help the industry become more efficient and effective across the even broader of areas. We have a significant opportunity ahead. And with a focus on product excellence and customer success, we're becoming an essential strategic partner to the industry.  Now I'll open up the call to your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of Ken Wang from Oppenheimer. \nKen Wong: Fantastic. My first question is for Peter, maybe Paul, at Investor Day, you guys talked about getting an emotional commitment from customers to move over to Vault CRM. It looks like you got two written commitments now. Maybe give us some color into what went into that decision-making process for these large enterprises. And what kind of signal do you think this might send to the rest of the industry that are potentially looking at Vault CRM? \nPaul Shawah: Ken, thanks for the question. This is Paul. Yes, so we're super excited about Bayer and GSK, probably everybody on the call have seen the press releases but we also have them join us during the keynote on the main stage at Europe Summit, which was last week. A super exciting survey.  Essentially answered your question on the main stage, which was why did they select Vault CRM, and it came for them, it came down to something very similar, which was innovation. They're thinking about the future. They are excited about the next generation of CRM. And for them, even I'll paraphrase what GSK said because they said it very concisely, it was this idea that pharmacy is not a commodity, but it's a stall problem, thanks to Veeva. And with what that means is this is something that's very hard. It's difficult. It's something that they've done multiple CRM implementations in us. And it's not something they want to spend any energy on. They want a solution that works and that's proven and they want to be able to innovate and look forward. So that, in a nutshell, is the reason it's innovation, it's looking forward. It's building for the future. So we are super excited to have both Bayer and GSK talk about their selection. \nKen Wong: Got it. And then a follow-up for you, Brent. Just as we look at the billings number for the year, you guys trimmed at $40 million. Any way to help us segment how much of that might be the services piece, the FX piece. And I think you kind of mentioned there's a little bit of some combination of duration and timing involved. But would just love to kind of understand what the moving pieces are that got you to that $40 million. \nBrent Bowman: Yes, happy to, Ken. So about half of it is related to services, the services reduction we talked about on Investor Day. The balance of it is really split into a couple of buckets. One is on the proportion of quarterly billers versus new billers in our new business. So we had a higher mix of quarterly billers than we expected. And then the other portion of that is related to timing of deals. So some deals we expected to close in the Q4 time frame. Now it's going to be early fiscal year '25. And then to a smaller extent, there was some FX headwinds as well. So relative to our prior expectations. So those are the pieces of it, but the biggest portion of it was clearly services. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Peterson from Raymond James. \nBrian Peterson: So I'll start with Brent. I think there's been some debate in the past on how the services business correlates to subscription. Is that a leading indicator or not? I've gotten the question from investors. So I love any perspective you have on how we should think about the correlation between subscription and services. \nBrent Bowman: Services, happy to, Brian. Services is not a leading indicator. And there's a number of reasons. There's timing of deals. There's product requirements that are different between the type of product you're buying, customer-specific requirements. So that's not going to be a good leading indicator. And then on the subscription side, you have things like ramping deals and pricing and the like. So there a number of reasons why those 2 don't rely correlate and you shouldn't think of it that way. \nBrian Peterson: Great. And maybe just as a follow-up, on working automation side. I thought it was an interesting part of the product announcements out at the Investor Day. How do we think about the ramp of that product any or thought process and what your customers are using today? Thanks. \nPeter Gassner: I'll take that one. Yes, a little -- we'll start the development of that next year in 2024. So I think that's something you're seeing from Veeva as a strategic partner. We have a lot of products across R&D and commercial data, software and services. So we're a very strategic partner to our customers. So in general, once we know we're going to do something, we let our customers know so that they can do long-range planning around that. So in this case, you saw us announce that before we have established a development team, for example, for it. So it's very, very early and too early to say what the revenue ramp would be. In terms of what most of our customers are using, they might use Salesforce.com Marketing Cloud. They might use product from Adobe. Some of the smaller customers will outsource this to agencies. But those are probably the -- those are the predominant products that are used. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink from Baird. \nJoe Vruwink: In years past, just in the 3Q period, I think Veeva has had a fair amount of visibility and inclination just on the upcoming year because of where big pharma customers stand in their budgeting process. I'm wondering if you can maybe compare current visibility on that FY '25 revenue target versus what's been the case over recent history. And then just related to that topic since Brent, you were calling out some variables on just billings and this year, how do some of those things you called out maybe start to influence the puts and takes going into 2025? \nBrent Bowman: Hi, Joe. So we reiterated the $2.75 billion and the visibility that we have, every day you move forward, you have better visibility, and we have no less visibility than we had a year ago. So similar as we look out in front of us. And some things that to contemplate is we have some multiyear ramping deals that will contribute a larger amount next year. That's something that comes into play. But we have a long runway for growth. Our visibility is not less than it has been historically, at least as good, and we're confident in our ability to execute to the number. \nJoe Vruwink: That's great. And then I wanted to ask the outlook for the commercial segment. It's gone up more than I expected over the course of this year. And in the prepared remarks, I think you were referencing commercial content and like. So kind of a barbell in that, you have a very mature product growing nicely and that's still very early product growing nicely. There's understandably been a lot of focus on CRM of late. But how would you kind of frame performance from the non-CRM piece of commercial and kind of what you're seeing in market so far to drive what seems like has been upside to your original forecast? \nBrent Bowman: Yes, Joe, it's Brent. I'll take that one as well. So we have increased that commercial number through the course of the year. And you put it quite nicely in that it's a combination of our more established products, continuing to contribute revenue growth by content. And then our newer products like Link really kicking in nicely. And we're still very early days there. And then the data products, I think you saw in Peter's prepared remarks, really coming along nicely. We're very early days, but we're optimistic in a very long journey there. So those are the things that we think about. And Crossix is another one that's contributing nicely as well to our growth. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dylan Becker from William Blair. \nDylan Becker : Maybe staying on the theme of data here as well. Brent, you just called out Compass, maybe for Paul on that side. There's a lot of new customer momentum. I know we're releasing some new offerings there early next year. But how do you think about that enthusiasm, maybe kind of validating the strategy and some of the encouraging momentum from customers around that strategy as we think about that upcoming opportunity? I know it's beyond 2024. But as we think about kind of the going -- or having that kind of full suite as we think about early next year? \nPaul Shawah: Yes. So it is a great validation of what we're doing. We have -- we're excited -- we have a very clear product strategy with what we're doing in data and more broadly overall with Data Cloud. We're building a modern data platform. Compass is a key part of that. We started with patient data. We did announce the expansion of that portfolio at the beginning part of next year with prescriber and national. So with those 3 products in Compass, we are well positioned to be the standard data provider for even the very largest pharma companies. And the momentum that you saw in the quarter is a good indicator for us. It's a good indicator that new customers are starting and trialing our data products but that existing customers are expanding, where we started with one brand and then we expand to an additional brand. So it is, in fact, a great validation product strategy, our commitment to getting product excellence. So we're on the right path with Compass. We feel good about that. \nDylan Becker : Got it. And then maybe for Peter, too, right? As you think about that evolution of Data Cloud to R&D, obviously, a lot of kind of pertinent use cases there. But how do you think about that data standardization playing in with the kind of work flow or process standardization at some of the momentum you're seeing in that clinical suite today, maybe what the value can accrue from having kind of both the connected workflow and standardized data as we think about development life cycles as well. \nPeter Gassner: Yes, I'm really excited about that. I think our clinical opportunity and data can be which were maybe larger than our commercial one. It really can be large. Now we're much earlier. So that has all proven out. And there's a very strong, very strong synergy between our software and clinical and the data products that we can build.  So if you look at it big picture, I think Veeva has been working pretty hard at cleaning up the software side of life sciences over the last 15 years, and we've made a lot of progress, still more to go with adoption, but we've clearly got great footprint for it.  Now with Data Cloud, I see us cleaning up the industry data and harmonizing the industry data, and then we'll make our data and software work very well together. So that's really what we're talking about for the industry cloud, it's a digital transformation, which is software and data, all working together. So I'm very excited about it. I think the special sauce on the clinical side is clinical data all on its own is not as valuable as clinical data that can work with clinical software. And I think we're into revolutionize that area. It will just take some time. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan McDonald from Needham & Company. \nRyan MacDonald: Maybe first one for Brent. You talked about hiring fewer people in the quarter. And as we just look out into next year, what areas might you be adding still? And how you're thinking about the hiring environment or hiring plan, given that we're starting now to see more and more companies right-size their organization structure heading into next year again? \nBrent Bowman: Yes. So overall, our hiring strategy hasn't changed. We're focused on hiring for growth and we're going to focus on areas where we can drive customer success and innovation. So that's always been our approach. And we're going to do it in a disciplined way. You saw in Q3, we had a lower hiring quarter than you have seen in the recent past. And looking out to the balance of fiscal year '24, it's reasonable to expect that, that lower higher rate continues. Not going to get into fiscal year '25 at this point in 90 days, we'll provide our traditional metrics, which would include operating income and margin. And obviously, headcount will be factored into that. \nRyan MacDonald: Super helpful. I appreciate the color. Peter, maybe just a follow-up for you. You talked about in the prepared remarks about some of the lower clinical data products around CDB, RTSM, ePRO and at your Analyst Day, talking about how this really expands the TAM within that area. As you start to speak with customers or prospective customers about some of these newer products, what sort of appetite are you seeing for -- from those customers around development or co-development on some of these newer areas and sort of willingness to make some of those earlier investments with you in innovation on the product roadmap amidst the evolving environment? \nPeter Gassner: Yes. Great question about the clinical data software. You have EDC is the core of it, the first thing and then you have others CDB, we have Study Training. We have ePRO and RTSM. Customers are generally going to be very conservative in that area. So really, we have to innovate first and then they will come along because this is -- these are their studies, right? And they plan these studies for a long time. So there's going to be pretty conservative. So I think it's an area that starts slowly, but then for the same reason why it starts slowly, and then it develops momentum. And if customers end up having something that they really like, boy, will they stick to with it.  And right now, the industry is not well served. If you look at the sort of, I would say, the professionalism of the ePRO applications out there or the RTSM applications out there. They're not of the level of professionalism of what is Veeva doing. Our products are getting there. So that's one thing which is both the products and the services. And then I think the real code is the integration, the process integration, for example, between our RTSM and our ePRO had a discussion last week with some clinical leaders at a top 20 pharma. And when we were discussing the integration that we will do between our RTSM and our EDC and how that affects the prescreening -- the screening process and the ability to get patients into the right trial, this can be transformational.  In some cases, when that workflow breaks down, you might lose 6 months exclusivity on a blockbuster product because of the delay of a pivotal trial. That's money you never get back. That's the criticality of these systems, and it causes a little bit of conservatism, right?  Well, so I might use your RTSM who else is using your RTSM for all of your studies? Well, nobody is yet, you can be first. Well, hey, I'll just -- I'll wait and see on that. So it's that type of thing. Hard to get in there, really hard to get out if you're doing a good job. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Wallace from Guggenheim Securities. \nJack Wallace : I just wanted to ask about Compass and the event around clients migrating to the Vault CRM platform. How much does other logical upsell here? And is it fair to think about the migration event being a natural upselling opportunity? \nPeter Gassner: It's a great question, Jack about Compass and Vault CRM. I would say they're not the same at all. They're quite disconnected. Compass in many ways, is a much more strategic decision because that really affects how you apply your resources and in Compass we're reinventing how you can do data. So it's a much more strategic decision. It's related to analytics and its purchase brand level for brand analytics. So it has these dynamics. Also, for example, Compass is something we sell to companies that are 2 years sometimes away from having a field force. They're doing their planning involved of their market potential. So it's quite disconnected versus where CRM is, hey, now you're ready to launch you just need a system with the full functionality, Veeva, that's kind of a soft problem. So there would be the CRM playing into that. On Compass, well, gosh, we've been using IQVIA for 20 years. You're coming with a different approach. We're all, hey, they're really out of phase, and they don't depend on each other.  Now it's nice to have multiple products to be able to bring in to a customer so you can provide the full commercial solution, be the CRM, commercial content, Crossix for your media measurement, Link for your deep data, Compass. So we have a lot of things that can fit together. And especially for a smaller company, they will look for that partner, hey, I just -- I need to get all this in a hurry. But in general, those things are linked together, and I wouldn't view Vault CRM as a catalyst for Compass. Catalyst for Compass is going to be its product excellence and how well we do on our launch of Prescriber and National, anyway. \nJack Wallace : That's helpful. And then one for Brent around billings. Just to put a bow around the change in terms and cadence of billings, help me with the math here. If we had a $12 million headwind in the third quarter, does that mean about $6 million of billings from the third quarter slip into the first half of next year? And then is that number of, say, $6 million to $9 million from the fourth, so add all up $12 million to $15 million or so that just due to billing cadence got pushed into '25? \nBrent Bowman: Yes. I'm not going to break down to the specific numbers, but I can give you like the directional numbers around this. So I said about half the services. And then there is the duration piece of it, right? So then the balance is split pretty much between 2 buckets with a little bit of FX. So that duration piece, that's a -- that's just a matter of over time, when it's going to build. So we have more quarterly billers than we expected for our new business. So that's about 25%-ish of the residual. And then the other piece was literally the timing of deals. Again, some of that was deals that pushed out from the back half of the year into the first part of the year. So that's at the high level how to break down the buckets and that's been contemplated in our 2,750 revenue number for fiscal year '25. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stan Berenshteyn from Wells Fargo Securities. \nStan Berenshteyn: First, Peter or Paul, in the prepared remarks, it was mentioned you had solid bookings under Crossix including brand expansions. I recall that process has seen some choppy demand in prior quarters. Is the reason that you're seeing a pickup of activity on this front? \nPeter Gassner: I guess the reasons are some is just timing, how things laid out. Also just solid execution by the Crossix team on the product and on the sales and marketing. And I think some of our competitors also last year sort of maybe oversold what they could actually deliver. So we had a few potentials where the customers last year went for some things because they were promised quite a few things actual delivery didn't match. And so they, in some cases, went -- came back to Crossix. In some cases, they went to Crossix for the first time. So really to solid execution and some timing. \nStan Berenshteyn: Got it. And then maybe one for Brent. Services gross margin in the quarter, I think, was the highest in 8 quarters or so. Is there anything to call out here besides hiring? And how should we think about the progression going forward? \nBrent Bowman: Yes. We're talking about from quarter-to-quarter, you're going to see vacillation in services margins. If you look forward in Q4, Q4 is a lower margin quarter because of holiday have less days to be utilized. But we're always going to focus on having the right amount of capacity to address the service demand we have. And we did a nice job of executing to that in Q3, you saw a little bit higher service margin in the quarter. So the range of margins you've seen over the last 4 to 8 quarters, that's probably a reasonable amount to think about. We're not looking to maximize it to 50% or anything like that. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Windley from Jefferies. \nDavid Windley : Pharma company -- so as backdrop, pharma companies have been trying to move commercial -- excuse me, commercial insights deeper into clinical development stages of their R&D. Veeva is unique in its span of solutions across clinical and commercial. I'm wondering how much you think about the integration of those solutions across clinical and commercial to drive stickiness of Veeva's solutions? How important is the transition of Vault in that effort? And how important is data in that effort? \nPeter Gassner: It's Peter. I'll take that one. I would say the most important thing that Veeva can deliver in that area is data on a common data platform. So enabling pharma companies to have a common data architecture across specifically commercial and clinical. So talk about product classes in the same way. Disease areas, therapeutic areas in the same way and so have a common vocabulary and a common source of truth for the data on both sides and to be able to interact with key opinion leaders, the same view of commercial a key opinion leader with a clinical key parameter. That's a key thing, the most important thing that Veeva can do. And I think we're really the only one setting out to do that.  The second one is enabling the process flow between commercial and clinical. So the connection between, for example, our CTMS system and our CRM system, that's useful. And then maybe potentially, the biggest barrier is process inside of pharmaceutical companies. Do they have processes? Do they have operating model? Do they have responsibility for enabling that flow? Our business consulting can really help there, especially as we're building up our business consulting and clinical, I think we're going to be experts at helping companies with their business process. Because you're right, I do feel, and I know most executives of large pharmaceutical companies feel that there's lost value because their integration -- process integration between commercial and clinical is not where they like it to be.  I don't -- I think you can't do that if you're not looking at a common view of the data. You won't be able to accomplish it. That's not deficient to make that connection happen, but I don't -- but I think it's necessary to make it happen. \nDavid Windley : That's great. As a follow-up and on a different topic, just on thinking about pipeline, funnel discussions for -- in your sales team. I think you've talked over multiple quarters as have others in life sciences, talked about slower decision-making budget scrutiny. You mentioned in your prepared remarks, I -- could you shed -- I mean, not that you haven't talked about it before, but give us the most updated view on how these kind of macroeconomic and IRA-related effects are affecting decision-making? And do you feel like that is getting worse or getting better? \nPeter Gassner: Yes. In terms of interest rates, IRA global conflicts, over the last 60 days, I don't view it as getting worse or better per se, it's kind of staying stable. It does result in questioning on decision-making conservatism. It's kind of a damper on innovation for small biotechs who are, hey, maybe I'm going to start up a biotech company, I need to raise funding. Oh, maybe I can't get funding now. So I don't put that up. I don't create that research. So that's a little bit tamer.  One of the things that has been happening through COVID and this downturn is some deferral thing, right? Veeva is -- a lot of the things we do are core capabilities. You're trying to modernize your core capabilities during COVID, sometimes had other priorities. When there's uncertainty, like conflict interest rates, et cetera, interest rates, et cetera, okay, comparative shift a little bit. But I do feel there's more deferred maintenance building up, especially in sort of top 100 life sciences companies, more deferred modernization of systems that's going to have to be taken care of over the next 2, 3, 4 years. So I think there's some demand starting to get pent up. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke. \nTyler Radke: Apologies if you covered this. I've been jumping around a few earnings all tonight. But I wanted to the top 20 pharma that you did migrate over to Vault CRM. I'm just curious, post that announcement, what's the interest in conversations been with others? And then if you could just share any milestones or other goals that you have in terms of the number of pharmas that you hope to have, call it, over the next few quarters or years? \nPaul Shawah: Yes. Tyler, this is Paul. Yes. So in terms of you mentioned kind of migrations. These companies have announced their selection. The migration will follow. So we'll do a little bit of services work next year, but you can think of their migration starting in 2025. That's when we are -- we'll have early customers next year. You can think about that as a milestone. We we'll have some early customers go through the migration process with us. We treat it like an early adopter program like we do with any other product. So that's what we'll use next year for, and then 2025, we'll be ready to scale. So that's what's next for these companies. They've announced their selection. They want to be able to communicate that internally and align their organization on what their go-forward strategy is. That's really important for them to get organized and focused and aligned. So they're -- they've shifted from decision mode to execution mode.  Now in terms of other companies, we're ready when they are, right? I think this has created some additional urgency or expanded our new commercial cloud has created some additional excitement in energy that moving to the Vault platform unlocked a lot of that innovation. But there's no time line. We're not forcing our customers to go on any particular time line. I do expect most will go starting in 2025. But 2026, '27, that's when you'll start to see the majority of customers moving. \nPeter Gassner: I would -- if I just chime in there, a question about momentum. Our Customer Summit at Europe, calls over 1,000 people there, right? And Bayer were there and GSK were there and they speak both in a large session and in smaller executive sessions. So it\u2019s certainly a momentum builder, right? Not only that they're going to see the CRM, but why? And what was their thought process? Because these companies are kind of leading the charge. The great reference selling there. Also things like we demoed -- we did a concept demo of service center for the first time live to the customers there. And I think that was very well received. So the vision starts to get to get clear and it's building the momentum. \nTyler Radke: Got it. And yes, sorry, I didn't mean migration, though have been impressive if you migrated those customers. And in weeks, I meant more the signing. So good -- good to hear the excitement from other customers. Just as a follow-up, Brent, I know your favorite topic here on billings. But I guess 2 quick clarifications. Number one, as we think about the updated normalized billings guide for this year, and if you walk through some of the puts and takes that's driving it down. I guess the changes to billings terms and invoicing duration, wouldn't that be normalized, if you will, in the normalized billings? Or is the normalization just for TSC? And then I know you're not guiding the billings for FY '25, but just as we think about the historical relationship between revenue and billings and what does seem to be maybe some modest duration headwinds, anything to keep in mind there? \nBrent Bowman: Sure. On your first part of your question, so what we normalize is we normalize this for changes in our renewal base. So if you have an existing customer renewal base, they change frequency or they change duration, we normalize that out. So we take the noise out. What we do for new business is we do our best effort to model what we expect the profile of that new business to come in. And so what you're hearing you say is the expectation we have for new business, there was -- the actual fact pattern was a bit different. So we have more quarterly billers in that new business than we anticipated. We thought we'd have a bit more annual. So it's new business, not normalized. It's the renewal portion that we do normalize.  And then your second question is we contemplated in the billings that we are exiting fiscal year '24 in our reiterated fiscal year '25 total revenue number. So $2.75 billion, and we feel good about our ability to execute against that. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs. \nCarolyn Valenti: This is Carolyn Valenti on for Gabriela. Just one for me and going to be again on the billings dynamic. But just related to the deals that you talked about being pushed from the back half of this year into early next year. There was clearly a change versus your initial expectations. And I know you said there's nothing incremental in the past 90 days on macro, but can you help us reconcile those 2 comments a little bit? \nBrent Bowman: Yes. I mean you're going to have -- it's going to be customer by customer, right? There is no exact pattern, that you can say across the larger cohorts. And in the first half of the year, I recall, the actual -- we had favorable linearity. So from period to period, it's going to ebb and flow depending on the specific customer situation, what approvals they require, the size and scale and the complexity of the deal. So it's a continuation of what we've seen. Sometimes it's in your favor, sometimes it's not. And that's what we saw. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. \nKirk Materne : Paul, just -- there's going to be a lot of discussion about migrations over the next couple of years. How should we think about sort of the services work around all this, meaning you're going to have a lot of customers, obviously, going through the migration process? How do you make sure that there's not sort of a bottleneck from a services perspective so that -- and maybe there's just not enough work, so that's not that big of a deal, but I was just kind of curious, how do you make sure that the right customers, especially your big ones, are aligned with either your own services capabilities or your GSI partners. Can you just talk about that a little bit? \nPaul Shawah: Yes, sure. And one of the things we're laser focused on right now is making the migration as repeatable as possible, and that's going to include some product work that we're doing to automate some of the migration. But it also includes scaling out the Vault CRM services team, and we have people now dedicated and focused to that. Part of this is focus pays off. And this is specific, the kind of thing that we think about when we think about executing really well. Part of our strategy is to execute really well in this area, and we're putting dedicated people on it. And that's going to help us create the focus but also the team to expand and scale and support customers as they -- we know roughly what that time line looks what we'll be ready to support it.  And I would say the third part of it is enabling our partner ecosystem. So we are working closely to make sure that they know what our role is and they know what their role is and how they can help us and how we can scale, support customers really across the globe. Remember, this is the U.S., it's Europe, it's Asia, it's LatAm. So we have a lot of customers, and we're making sure that we're ready with our own tooling, our services and our partners. \nKirk Materne : Yes. And you mentioned that -- go ahead, please. \nPeter Gassner: I would chime in there a little bit. One way to think about, it is you had a big bolus of work around Veeva\u2019s CRM between 2012 and 2017. Roughly speaking, maybe we move somewhere around half the market, a bit less than that from Siebel or Cegedim or some other things to be this year. And that was a big bolus of work that was done by Veeva services and our partners Accenture and regional partners over a 5-year period. Now we have this 5 year period from 2025 to 2030, we probably have about as much work to do. Now we have more movement to do because we have to move 90% of the industry over, but the effort is less than -- significantly less than half of the effort and certainly in the migration it\u2019s less than half. So we have to mobilize our own services and the partners to do that. But these are things that we know how to do. \nKirk Materne : That's helpful, Peter, for dimensionalizing that. And then, Brent, one more just on billings. In terms of the duration changes that you're seeing, are these bigger customers that just want to break it up into bite-size pieces from a payments perspective, smaller customers just trying to save cash. I was just wondering if there's any commonality that you're seeing that's sort of hitting duration right now? I realize it fluctuates, but has anything changed, I guess, on that front? \nBrent Bowman: Again, nothing fundamentally changed. I mean specifically, a couple of the large items were simple co-terms. So you have -- they're just co-terming to the number of deals they have onto a common date. So it's nothing more fundamental than that. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jilinda Singh from Truist Securities. \nJailendra Singh: Given some of the macro issues you, guys, talked about. I was just curious how our price increased conversations trending so far, especially in the environment when macro has gone a little challenging, making sure you still feel good about your 4% price increase expectations for next year? \nPeter Gassner: I can take that one. overall, we're not doing price increases we are doing -- we keep up with the CPI, and we're doing in a very customer-friendly way. So we're capping that by 4%. And we're doing that in arrears by giving customers at least 8 months\u2019 notice depending on when their order form is. So no, it's going well. And I definitely don't view it as a price increase. It's very predictable from Veeva. So the macro is not really affecting that. \nJailendra Singh: Then my follow-up is around the comment you had in your prepared remarks about data market and life science moving somewhat slower than the softer market, you called out anticompetitive behavior from one of your peers. Can you elaborate more on that? Is that something you have observed more recently after your push in this market? And how does those market dynamics impact approach and generally just pushing this market? \nPeter Gassner: Yes. I called out the behavior of our competitor IQVIA. No, that's not a dynamic. I've been aware of that for more than 10 years. And of course, IQ has been recorded multiple times for this. So it's not a -- it's just not a new dynamic. I just felt in the prepared remarks to call it out. But in data, it can be a bit slower moving because of the conservative in that area, conservatism in that area. That's understandable. And then the anticompetitive behavior of IQVIA also creates significant barriers there because let's say the customer is using the IQVIA data for one data product, and we're selling one data product. And our services are necessary to mix those 2 data products together to provide a solution for the customer as well. IQVIA is not going to allow us to do that. They're not going to grant, let's call it a third-party agreement. So that's what slows things down. But we're making great progress, and it's easier for a small company when they start up.  So I think next year, you'll see some smaller companies commercializing for the first time that just decide, look, I'm going to be IQVIA free for my whole life, and I'm going to start out that way. I don't need to deal with that old stuff anymore. I think that's going to happen, but it's -- that's a long way from, hey, most of the top 20 using Veeva for most of their data products for most of their brands. That's a that's a 15-year journey. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. \nCraig Hettenbach: Just following up on the Bayer and GSK commentary. Is there anything in particular about those customer relationships that made it logical for them to be early adopters on both CRM? And how are you thinking about the cadence for additional customers from an announcement perspective like next year? \nPaul Shawah: Yes. quite good question. And every customer is unique. They're all in their own different stages, whether that's things related to their business or their pipeline or when they may have product launches. GSK and Bayer, we've had good, long-standing partnerships with both companies for a very long time. And they're thinking, they both had this idea of leading thinking. We want to put the decision-making process behind us, and we want to start focus on executing. They were confident they did their due diligence. They very quickly became very confident in their answer and their approach, so they wanted to put a clear stake in the ground and make that decision and communicate it and now shift into execution mode. So I would say just a strong partnership. We've delivered very well and consistently for them for a very, very long time. They trust Veeva. So they're ready to move forward.  In terms of other customers and the rest of the market, we're certainly in conversations with the rest of top 20, all of the large enterprise companies, of course, are small and medium-sized customers. Many of those conversations have started. It's not a mathematical thing. You won't see -- we know we have the next roughly 5 or 6 years, but it's not mathematical. It's dependent upon many different factors and variables. So I would think of it as we're in that early summer stage right now, and then over time, we'll start to see it ramp in.  And some of these, you may not see announcements. I think the way to think about it is we'll provide updates when there's kind of a material update to give. You may not see an announcement for every customer. But when there's something material, we'll kind of let The Street know. \nCraig Hettenbach: That's helpful. And then, Peter, you made a comment regarding the IRA in terms of smaller biotech innovation and that's certainly and focus here. I'm curious just your larger pharma companies, any feedback you're hearing from them, whether it's maybe trade-offs they're making as they kind of manage around this? Any feedback there? \nPeter Gassner: Yes, they're looking at that in terms of their product planning where will they invest, should they invest in that molecule, should they delay running a trial or accelerate running a trial. So certainly, it affects their planning. But pharma is good at that. They have to adjust to these factors, these government factors around the globe. And so I think they're adjusting and it may become the new normal in a year or two. So no dramatic change is causing some adjustments. \nOperator: Your next question call comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from TD Cowen. \nLucas Romanski: This is Lucas on for Charles. I want to ask about the development cloud and the subscription growth framework you guys have going forward. If I look back at the Investor Day slides, where you guys break out customers and products per customer. It shows that you guys are seeing fewer total products sold in the Development Cloud through fiscal first half. At the same time, you're guiding to 22% to 23% growth in 4Q after accounting for the impact of TFC, which is a step down from 3Q and 2Q. You guys have noted that you're not seeing an impact from macro on subs quite yet, but this is a notable step down in growth. Is this an indication that the segment is starting to mature a bit and that we think about this category growing at a more mature rate going forward? And then understand that we'll get guidance at the next print, but is this 22% growth rate ex-TFC, a good jumping off point for R&D subs growth in fiscal '25. \nBrent Bowman: Yes. So to your point, we reiterated the fiscal year '25 guide at $2.75 billion. So clearly, that factors the subscription and services and the mix underneath that. What we did see was timing when you talk about in the year. So some timing that impacted fiscal year '24, it will have less of an impact on fiscal year '25. But importantly, we have a long runway for growth in front of us. We're very early days and across the portfolio, specifically R&D and to your point, we'll get into the details in about coming days. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler. \nHannah Rudoff: This is Hannah Rudoff on for Brent. Encouraged to hear about your early traction with Vault CRM. Those 6 non-Vault Veeva CRM customers you landed in the quarter, do most of them plan to migrate to Vault CRM before that 2030 deadline? Or is that even part of the discussion when you're signing with them? \nPaul Shawah: Yes. So we did have -- we had a good strong quarter with CRM overall. So we had 9 wins. And you're right, some of them are on Veeva CRM. And each of those is a discussion with the customer, and what's right for them and based on their timing. And yes, of course, that's the strategy is to -- they'll start on Veeva CRM. And then at some point before 2030, they'll move over to Vault CRM. And certainly, for some of these customers that are now doing Veeva CRM. That transition path becomes pretty clear and very, very clean. So they have full awareness and knowledge and that's part of the strategy. \nHannah Rudoff: Great. Super helpful. And then at your European Commercial Summit other than Vault CRM, what commercial developments were customers most excited to hear about? \nPaul Shawah: Yes. Sure we do pick one. We had a very lively Europe Summit. So and part of that is related to -- we now have our commercial products, our software products that are moving in all part of the all platforms. So that unlocks a lot of potential for us. So we were able to announce it. One is that Peter alluded to the service center demo. Remember, we announced that 5, 6 months ago at our U.S. Summit and now we demoed it live. So really strong execution that resonated really well. The announcements around marketing and outpatient CRM were some appreciated. And then in the data space, we had a new data announcement around Pulse data, and Peter talked a lot about that during our Investor Day. But more broadly, what we're doing in data, the innovation we're bringing in data by creating this common data architecture. So you asked for one thing, I gave you 4 or 5, but it was really kind of an action-packed summit with lots of announcements and we put a lot of momentum in multiple different areas. \nPeter Gassner: There's a lot of -- Paul, there's a lot of excitement around modular content and the commercial content area as well, right? That track was very largely because we've done things over the last year in modular product content and now it's sitting adopted in the field, so this great excitement over the one too. \nPaul Shawah: For sure -- and that -- and just to go into that a little bit deeper, that we're executing really well on the commercial content side and modular content. But as we think about what Vault allows us to do, it's bringing that content closer to the engagement channel. It's a platform that uniquely sorts both of those content and the engagement, whether it's the sales channel or field medical or even marketing in the future. So it's highly unique in that we're in a unique position to be able to solve that, that content distribution from the time frame in a very modular efficient way all the way to the time it gets out to the end customer, whether it's a marketing channel or a sales channel. So yes, that was also an exciting announcement. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills from Bank of America. \nBradley Sills : Great. I wanted to ask about the comments on some of the deals slipping that affected the quarterly billings into the next year. Any more color there? I mean we typically hear about the slipping and then they close in the subsequent quarter. So what are the puts and takes that are impacting that? And what gives you that confidence that deals will close next year? \nPeter Gassner: I will take that one. Each deal is different, but I would say, by and large, just timing that gets pushed out by some random bounces of the ball and some conservatism and extra scrutiny. So that's what it is. What gives us confidence is the competitive environment is stronger than ever, right? So that is what gives us real confidence, both in each of our product areas and then customers seeing that, wow, we can bring complete solutions across R&D and commercial software and data.  Also, the customers being slightly a bit more conservative, they're not -- customers are spending less on speculative projects. So they tend to go more towards Veeva and core capabilities. So that's what gives me even more confidence about our strong market position. And then since our products aren't optional over time. I have a lot of confidence that our market share, we're in a better market position than we were 12 months ago. \nBradley Sills : Wonderful. And then if you could comment, please, Peter, on just the clinical deal pipeline and how that's been impacted. It would seem less impacted by the macro because it's trial-related but these are also big transformational projects, if it's a new customer, for example. Any commentary or observations on how the macro has impacted that clinical business, which is such a critical growth driver. \nPeter Gassner: Yes. We have a small amount of our business in the clinical and the very small customers maybe that have under 500 employees, under 300 employees. So that certainly impacted because sometimes food can't get funding to do the trial or they move and go out of business. So that's impacted specifically. Other than that, the general conservatism doesn't impact clinical any more than it would be regulatory or safety or quality. These are large infrastructure projects, and they're just having a bit more scrutiny than they used to. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Poland from RBC Capital Markets. \nRishi Jaluria : This is actually Rishi Jaluria from RBC. Not sure why it but my colleague's name. Actually wanted to ask 2 questions around generative AI. First, I would like to maybe drill a little bit into kind of a theme that we've been hearing more as we've been doing our conversation with partners and industry in which is that as generative AI is working behind clinical trials. It is leading to maybe more of a tailwind towards personalized and precision medicine, which feels like not only should that benefit your CDMS platform, but even on the data side, what you have with Compass, correct me if I'm wrong, it seems like it's maybe a little bit more tailored to that. So maybe if you could help us understand some of the trends that you're seeing out there and how that can play out and then I have a follow-up. \nPeter Gassner: In terms of the generative AI, mostly, I haven't seen a big impact in clinical. There's good experimentation and projects around helping to write or evaluate protocols, for example, but not using things like generative AI to do statistical analysis or predict where the patients are. I think there, the more appropriate tool, which people are using and continue to use more and more data. Really having the right data, running the right algorithms being systematic about it. So yes, I just haven't seen that impact of generative AI. You see it more in other areas that relate to content accretion and asking of questions, writing 15 narratives, things like that. \nRishi Jaluria : Got it. No, that's really helpful. And then maybe just sticking on the theme of clinical and Gen AI, coming off the EU Commercial Summit. I'm sure you heard a lot of use cases from customers that they want to explore around Gen AI and the society. I think a lot of those very straightforward. Maybe on the clinical side, right? I mean you talked a little bit about CDMS. But I imagine there's a lot of data you have you put through around content, including regulatory submissions in FDA. I imagine there's probably use cases around the sector language that people can use to expedite their approvals and so on and so forth. Maybe just to talk a little bit about what sort of use cases you're hearing from customers that they want you to be part of when it comes to the clinical side of the equation that would be really helpful. \nPeter Gassner: Yes. So -- some are just very straightforward what's called the clinical master data. Who are the investigators, who are in the sites around the world and what is their patient characteristics like that's hugely important for site selection, but also for recording your internal operations, how efficient are you. Then -- so that's what we call OpenData clinical.  SiteBase is the deep profiles around all the sites and investigators, all their specialties, all their activity. So that's again for more detailed section. Then Clinical Pulse. That's something we've announced, which we'll be producing next year. And that's things like, okay, I'm a pharmaceutical company, and I picked these 2 milestones to measure. What's the time between my last patient visit and my lack of my clinical database. And I'm a pharmaceutical company, what's my time there. Okay. And now what's the industry's average time there? So that I can start to see. Am I head behind there? What's my opportunity for improvement or not. And that's just one measurement. So I think it's those 3 areas that customers are excited about from Veeva, the clinical master data. The deep data, specifically around site selection, critically important. And then the Clinical Pulse to optimize their internal business processes and benchmark the industry. \nOperator: We have no further questions in our queue at this time. I will now turn the call over to Peter Gassner, Chief Executive Officer, for closing remarks. \nPeter Gassner : I'd like to close by thanking our customers for their trust and partnership and our employees for their continued commitment to our values and do the right thing, customer success, employee success and speed. \nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brent Bowman",
            "content": "Yes, happy to, Ken. So about half of it is related to services, the services reduction we talked about on Investor Day. The balance of it is really split into a couple of buckets. One is on the proportion of quarterly billers versus new billers in our new business. So we had a higher mix of quarterly billers than we expected. And then the other portion of that is related to timing of deals. So some deals we expected to close in the Q4 time frame. Now it's going to be early fiscal year '25. And then to a smaller extent, there was some FX headwinds as well. So relative to our prior expectations. So those are the pieces of it, but the biggest portion of it was clearly services. Services, happy to, Brian. Services is not a leading indicator. And there's a number of reasons. There's timing of deals. There's product requirements that are different between the type of product you're buying, customer-specific requirements. So that's not going to be a good leading indicator. And then on the subscription side, you have things like ramping deals and pricing and the like. So there a number of reasons why those 2 don't rely correlate and you shouldn't think of it that way. Hi, Joe. So we reiterated the $2.75 billion and the visibility that we have, every day you move forward, you have better visibility, and we have no less visibility than we had a year ago. So similar as we look out in front of us. And some things that to contemplate is we have some multiyear ramping deals that will contribute a larger amount next year. That's something that comes into play. But we have a long runway for growth. Our visibility is not less than it has been historically, at least as good, and we're confident in our ability to execute to the number. Yes, Joe, it's Brent. I'll take that one as well. So we have increased that commercial number through the course of the year. And you put it quite nicely in that it's a combination of our more established products, continuing to contribute revenue growth by content. And then our newer products like Link really kicking in nicely. And we're still very early days there. And then the data products, I think you saw in Peter's prepared remarks, really coming along nicely. We're very early days, but we're optimistic in a very long journey there. So those are the things that we think about. And Crossix is another one that's contributing nicely as well to our growth. Yes. So overall, our hiring strategy hasn't changed. We're focused on hiring for growth and we're going to focus on areas where we can drive customer success and innovation. So that's always been our approach. And we're going to do it in a disciplined way. You saw in Q3, we had a lower hiring quarter than you have seen in the recent past. And looking out to the balance of fiscal year '24, it's reasonable to expect that, that lower higher rate continues. Not going to get into fiscal year '25 at this point in 90 days, we'll provide our traditional metrics, which would include operating income and margin. And obviously, headcount will be factored into that. Yes. I'm not going to break down to the specific numbers, but I can give you like the directional numbers around this. So I said about half the services. And then there is the duration piece of it, right? So then the balance is split pretty much between 2 buckets with a little bit of FX. So that duration piece, that's a -- that's just a matter of over time, when it's going to build. So we have more quarterly billers than we expected for our new business. So that's about 25%-ish of the residual. And then the other piece was literally the timing of deals. Again, some of that was deals that pushed out from the back half of the year into the first part of the year. So that's at the high level how to break down the buckets and that's been contemplated in our 2,750 revenue number for fiscal year '25. Yes. We're talking about from quarter-to-quarter, you're going to see vacillation in services margins. If you look forward in Q4, Q4 is a lower margin quarter because of holiday have less days to be utilized. But we're always going to focus on having the right amount of capacity to address the service demand we have. And we did a nice job of executing to that in Q3, you saw a little bit higher service margin in the quarter. So the range of margins you've seen over the last 4 to 8 quarters, that's probably a reasonable amount to think about. We're not looking to maximize it to 50% or anything like that. Sure. On your first part of your question, so what we normalize is we normalize this for changes in our renewal base. So if you have an existing customer renewal base, they change frequency or they change duration, we normalize that out. So we take the noise out. What we do for new business is we do our best effort to model what we expect the profile of that new business to come in. And so what you're hearing you say is the expectation we have for new business, there was -- the actual fact pattern was a bit different. So we have more quarterly billers in that new business than we anticipated. We thought we'd have a bit more annual. So it's new business, not normalized. It's the renewal portion that we do normalize.  And then your second question is we contemplated in the billings that we are exiting fiscal year '24 in our reiterated fiscal year '25 total revenue number. So $2.75 billion, and we feel good about our ability to execute against that. Yes. I mean you're going to have -- it's going to be customer by customer, right? There is no exact pattern, that you can say across the larger cohorts. And in the first half of the year, I recall, the actual -- we had favorable linearity. So from period to period, it's going to ebb and flow depending on the specific customer situation, what approvals they require, the size and scale and the complexity of the deal. So it's a continuation of what we've seen. Sometimes it's in your favor, sometimes it's not. And that's what we saw. Again, nothing fundamentally changed. I mean specifically, a couple of the large items were simple co-terms. So you have -- they're just co-terming to the number of deals they have onto a common date. So it's nothing more fundamental than that. Yes. So to your point, we reiterated the fiscal year '25 guide at $2.75 billion. So clearly, that factors the subscription and services and the mix underneath that. What we did see was timing when you talk about in the year. So some timing that impacted fiscal year '24, it will have less of an impact on fiscal year '25. But importantly, we have a long runway for growth in front of us. We're very early days and across the portfolio, specifically R&D and to your point, we'll get into the details in about coming days."

            "name": "Peter Gassner",
            "content": "Thank you, Gunnar, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We have solid Q3 with revenue and operating income ahead of guidance, including total revenue of $617 million and GAAP operating income of $235 million. As I shared in our prepared remarks, we had a number of great milestones and new product announcements in the quarter as we progressed in building our industry cloud for life sciences. With the growing set of high-value applications, data and services in R&D and commercial, we can help the industry become more efficient and effective across the even broader of areas. We have a significant opportunity ahead. And with a focus on product excellence and customer success, we're becoming an essential strategic partner to the industry.  Now I'll open up the call to your questions. I'll take that one. Yes, a little -- we'll start the development of that next year in 2024. So I think that's something you're seeing from Veeva as a strategic partner. We have a lot of products across R&D and commercial data, software and services. So we're a very strategic partner to our customers. So in general, once we know we're going to do something, we let our customers know so that they can do long-range planning around that. So in this case, you saw us announce that before we have established a development team, for example, for it. So it's very, very early and too early to say what the revenue ramp would be. In terms of what most of our customers are using, they might use Salesforce.com Marketing Cloud. They might use product from Adobe. Some of the smaller customers will outsource this to agencies. But those are probably the -- those are the predominant products that are used. Yes, I'm really excited about that. I think our clinical opportunity and data can be which were maybe larger than our commercial one. It really can be large. Now we're much earlier. So that has all proven out. And there's a very strong, very strong synergy between our software and clinical and the data products that we can build.  So if you look at it big picture, I think Veeva has been working pretty hard at cleaning up the software side of life sciences over the last 15 years, and we've made a lot of progress, still more to go with adoption, but we've clearly got great footprint for it.  Now with Data Cloud, I see us cleaning up the industry data and harmonizing the industry data, and then we'll make our data and software work very well together. So that's really what we're talking about for the industry cloud, it's a digital transformation, which is software and data, all working together. So I'm very excited about it. I think the special sauce on the clinical side is clinical data all on its own is not as valuable as clinical data that can work with clinical software. And I think we're into revolutionize that area. It will just take some time. Yes. Great question about the clinical data software. You have EDC is the core of it, the first thing and then you have others CDB, we have Study Training. We have ePRO and RTSM. Customers are generally going to be very conservative in that area. So really, we have to innovate first and then they will come along because this is -- these are their studies, right? And they plan these studies for a long time. So there's going to be pretty conservative. So I think it's an area that starts slowly, but then for the same reason why it starts slowly, and then it develops momentum. And if customers end up having something that they really like, boy, will they stick to with it.  And right now, the industry is not well served. If you look at the sort of, I would say, the professionalism of the ePRO applications out there or the RTSM applications out there. They're not of the level of professionalism of what is Veeva doing. Our products are getting there. So that's one thing which is both the products and the services. And then I think the real code is the integration, the process integration, for example, between our RTSM and our ePRO had a discussion last week with some clinical leaders at a top 20 pharma. And when we were discussing the integration that we will do between our RTSM and our EDC and how that affects the prescreening -- the screening process and the ability to get patients into the right trial, this can be transformational.  In some cases, when that workflow breaks down, you might lose 6 months exclusivity on a blockbuster product because of the delay of a pivotal trial. That's money you never get back. That's the criticality of these systems, and it causes a little bit of conservatism, right?  Well, so I might use your RTSM who else is using your RTSM for all of your studies? Well, nobody is yet, you can be first. Well, hey, I'll just -- I'll wait and see on that. So it's that type of thing. Hard to get in there, really hard to get out if you're doing a good job. It's a great question, Jack about Compass and Vault CRM. I would say they're not the same at all. They're quite disconnected. Compass in many ways, is a much more strategic decision because that really affects how you apply your resources and in Compass we're reinventing how you can do data. So it's a much more strategic decision. It's related to analytics and its purchase brand level for brand analytics. So it has these dynamics. Also, for example, Compass is something we sell to companies that are 2 years sometimes away from having a field force. They're doing their planning involved of their market potential. So it's quite disconnected versus where CRM is, hey, now you're ready to launch you just need a system with the full functionality, Veeva, that's kind of a soft problem. So there would be the CRM playing into that. On Compass, well, gosh, we've been using IQVIA for 20 years. You're coming with a different approach. We're all, hey, they're really out of phase, and they don't depend on each other.  Now it's nice to have multiple products to be able to bring in to a customer so you can provide the full commercial solution, be the CRM, commercial content, Crossix for your media measurement, Link for your deep data, Compass. So we have a lot of things that can fit together. And especially for a smaller company, they will look for that partner, hey, I just -- I need to get all this in a hurry. But in general, those things are linked together, and I wouldn't view Vault CRM as a catalyst for Compass. Catalyst for Compass is going to be its product excellence and how well we do on our launch of Prescriber and National, anyway. I guess the reasons are some is just timing, how things laid out. Also just solid execution by the Crossix team on the product and on the sales and marketing. And I think some of our competitors also last year sort of maybe oversold what they could actually deliver. So we had a few potentials where the customers last year went for some things because they were promised quite a few things actual delivery didn't match. And so they, in some cases, went -- came back to Crossix. In some cases, they went to Crossix for the first time. So really to solid execution and some timing. It's Peter. I'll take that one. I would say the most important thing that Veeva can deliver in that area is data on a common data platform. So enabling pharma companies to have a common data architecture across specifically commercial and clinical. So talk about product classes in the same way. Disease areas, therapeutic areas in the same way and so have a common vocabulary and a common source of truth for the data on both sides and to be able to interact with key opinion leaders, the same view of commercial a key opinion leader with a clinical key parameter. That's a key thing, the most important thing that Veeva can do. And I think we're really the only one setting out to do that.  The second one is enabling the process flow between commercial and clinical. So the connection between, for example, our CTMS system and our CRM system, that's useful. And then maybe potentially, the biggest barrier is process inside of pharmaceutical companies. Do they have processes? Do they have operating model? Do they have responsibility for enabling that flow? Our business consulting can really help there, especially as we're building up our business consulting and clinical, I think we're going to be experts at helping companies with their business process. Because you're right, I do feel, and I know most executives of large pharmaceutical companies feel that there's lost value because their integration -- process integration between commercial and clinical is not where they like it to be.  I don't -- I think you can't do that if you're not looking at a common view of the data. You won't be able to accomplish it. That's not deficient to make that connection happen, but I don't -- but I think it's necessary to make it happen. Yes. In terms of interest rates, IRA global conflicts, over the last 60 days, I don't view it as getting worse or better per se, it's kind of staying stable. It does result in questioning on decision-making conservatism. It's kind of a damper on innovation for small biotechs who are, hey, maybe I'm going to start up a biotech company, I need to raise funding. Oh, maybe I can't get funding now. So I don't put that up. I don't create that research. So that's a little bit tamer.  One of the things that has been happening through COVID and this downturn is some deferral thing, right? Veeva is -- a lot of the things we do are core capabilities. You're trying to modernize your core capabilities during COVID, sometimes had other priorities. When there's uncertainty, like conflict interest rates, et cetera, interest rates, et cetera, okay, comparative shift a little bit. But I do feel there's more deferred maintenance building up, especially in sort of top 100 life sciences companies, more deferred modernization of systems that's going to have to be taken care of over the next 2, 3, 4 years. So I think there's some demand starting to get pent up. I would -- if I just chime in there, a question about momentum. Our Customer Summit at Europe, calls over 1,000 people there, right? And Bayer were there and GSK were there and they speak both in a large session and in smaller executive sessions. So it's certainly a momentum builder, right? Not only that they're going to see the CRM, but why? And what was their thought process? Because these companies are kind of leading the charge. The great reference selling there. Also things like we demoed -- we did a concept demo of service center for the first time live to the customers there. And I think that was very well received. So the vision starts to get to get clear and it's building the momentum. I would chime in there a little bit. One way to think about, it is you had a big bolus of work around Veeva's CRM between 2012 and 2017. Roughly speaking, maybe we move somewhere around half the market, a bit less than that from Siebel or Cegedim or some other things to be this year. And that was a big bolus of work that was done by Veeva services and our partners Accenture and regional partners over a 5-year period. Now we have this 5 year period from 2025 to 2030, we probably have about as much work to do. Now we have more movement to do because we have to move 90% of the industry over, but the effort is less than -- significantly less than half of the effort and certainly in the migration it's less than half. So we have to mobilize our own services and the partners to do that. But these are things that we know how to do. I can take that one. overall, we're not doing price increases we are doing -- we keep up with the CPI, and we're doing in a very customer-friendly way. So we're capping that by 4%. And we're doing that in arrears by giving customers at least 8 months' notice depending on when their order form is. So no, it's going well. And I definitely don't view it as a price increase. It's very predictable from Veeva. So the macro is not really affecting that. Yes. I called out the behavior of our competitor IQVIA. No, that's not a dynamic. I've been aware of that for more than 10 years. And of course, IQ has been recorded multiple times for this. So it's not a -- it's just not a new dynamic. I just felt in the prepared remarks to call it out. But in data, it can be a bit slower moving because of the conservative in that area, conservatism in that area. That's understandable. And then the anticompetitive behavior of IQVIA also creates significant barriers there because let's say the customer is using the IQVIA data for one data product, and we're selling one data product. And our services are necessary to mix those 2 data products together to provide a solution for the customer as well. IQVIA is not going to allow us to do that. They're not going to grant, let's call it a third-party agreement. So that's what slows things down. But we're making great progress, and it's easier for a small company when they start up.  So I think next year, you'll see some smaller companies commercializing for the first time that just decide, look, I'm going to be IQVIA free for my whole life, and I'm going to start out that way. I don't need to deal with that old stuff anymore. I think that's going to happen, but it's -- that's a long way from, hey, most of the top 20 using Veeva for most of their data products for most of their brands. That's a that's a 15-year journey. Yes, they're looking at that in terms of their product planning where will they invest, should they invest in that molecule, should they delay running a trial or accelerate running a trial. So certainly, it affects their planning. But pharma is good at that. They have to adjust to these factors, these government factors around the globe. And so I think they're adjusting and it may become the new normal in a year or two. So no dramatic change is causing some adjustments. There's a lot of -- Paul, there's a lot of excitement around modular content and the commercial content area as well, right? That track was very largely because we've done things over the last year in modular product content and now it's sitting adopted in the field, so this great excitement over the one too. I will take that one. Each deal is different, but I would say, by and large, just timing that gets pushed out by some random bounces of the ball and some conservatism and extra scrutiny. So that's what it is. What gives us confidence is the competitive environment is stronger than ever, right? So that is what gives us real confidence, both in each of our product areas and then customers seeing that, wow, we can bring complete solutions across R&D and commercial software and data.  Also, the customers being slightly a bit more conservative, they're not -- customers are spending less on speculative projects. So they tend to go more towards Veeva and core capabilities. So that's what gives me even more confidence about our strong market position. And then since our products aren't optional over time. I have a lot of confidence that our market share, we're in a better market position than we were 12 months ago. Yes. We have a small amount of our business in the clinical and the very small customers maybe that have under 500 employees, under 300 employees. So that certainly impacted because sometimes food can't get funding to do the trial or they move and go out of business. So that's impacted specifically. Other than that, the general conservatism doesn't impact clinical any more than it would be regulatory or safety or quality. These are large infrastructure projects, and they're just having a bit more scrutiny than they used to. In terms of the generative AI, mostly, I haven't seen a big impact in clinical. There's good experimentation and projects around helping to write or evaluate protocols, for example, but not using things like generative AI to do statistical analysis or predict where the patients are. I think there, the more appropriate tool, which people are using and continue to use more and more data. Really having the right data, running the right algorithms being systematic about it. So yes, I just haven't seen that impact of generative AI. You see it more in other areas that relate to content accretion and asking of questions, writing 15 narratives, things like that. Yes. So -- some are just very straightforward what's called the clinical master data. Who are the investigators, who are in the sites around the world and what is their patient characteristics like that's hugely important for site selection, but also for recording your internal operations, how efficient are you. Then -- so that's what we call OpenData clinical.  SiteBase is the deep profiles around all the sites and investigators, all their specialties, all their activity. So that's again for more detailed section. Then Clinical Pulse. That's something we've announced, which we'll be producing next year. And that's things like, okay, I'm a pharmaceutical company, and I picked these 2 milestones to measure. What's the time between my last patient visit and my lack of my clinical database. And I'm a pharmaceutical company, what's my time there. Okay. And now what's the industry's average time there? So that I can start to see. Am I head behind there? What's my opportunity for improvement or not. And that's just one measurement. So I think it's those 3 areas that customers are excited about from Veeva, the clinical master data. The deep data, specifically around site selection, critically important. And then the Clinical Pulse to optimize their internal business processes and benchmark the industry. I'd like to close by thanking our customers for their trust and partnership and our employees for their continued commitment to our values and do the right thing, customer success, employee success and speed."

            "name": "Paul Shawah",
            "content": "Ken, thanks for the question. This is Paul. Yes, so we're super excited about Bayer and GSK, probably everybody on the call have seen the press releases but we also have them join us during the keynote on the main stage at Europe Summit, which was last week. A super exciting survey.  Essentially answered your question on the main stage, which was why did they select Vault CRM, and it came for them, it came down to something very similar, which was innovation. They're thinking about the future. They are excited about the next generation of CRM. And for them, even I'll paraphrase what GSK said because they said it very concisely, it was this idea that pharmacy is not a commodity, but it's a stall problem, thanks to Veeva. And with what that means is this is something that's very hard. It's difficult. It's something that they've done multiple CRM implementations in us. And it's not something they want to spend any energy on. They want a solution that works and that's proven and they want to be able to innovate and look forward. So that, in a nutshell, is the reason it's innovation, it's looking forward. It's building for the future. So we are super excited to have both Bayer and GSK talk about their selection. Yes. So it is a great validation of what we're doing. We have -- we're excited -- we have a very clear product strategy with what we're doing in data and more broadly overall with Data Cloud. We're building a modern data platform. Compass is a key part of that. We started with patient data. We did announce the expansion of that portfolio at the beginning part of next year with prescriber and national. So with those 3 products in Compass, we are well positioned to be the standard data provider for even the very largest pharma companies. And the momentum that you saw in the quarter is a good indicator for us. It's a good indicator that new customers are starting and trialing our data products but that existing customers are expanding, where we started with one brand and then we expand to an additional brand. So it is, in fact, a great validation product strategy, our commitment to getting product excellence. So we're on the right path with Compass. We feel good about that. Yes. Tyler, this is Paul. Yes. So in terms of you mentioned kind of migrations. These companies have announced their selection. The migration will follow. So we'll do a little bit of services work next year, but you can think of their migration starting in 2025. That's when we are -- we'll have early customers next year. You can think about that as a milestone. We we'll have some early customers go through the migration process with us. We treat it like an early adopter program like we do with any other product. So that's what we'll use next year for, and then 2025, we'll be ready to scale. So that's what's next for these companies. They've announced their selection. They want to be able to communicate that internally and align their organization on what their go-forward strategy is. That's really important for them to get organized and focused and aligned. So they're -- they've shifted from decision mode to execution mode.  Now in terms of other companies, we're ready when they are, right? I think this has created some additional urgency or expanded our new commercial cloud has created some additional excitement in energy that moving to the Vault platform unlocked a lot of that innovation. But there's no time line. We're not forcing our customers to go on any particular time line. I do expect most will go starting in 2025. But 2026, '27, that's when you'll start to see the majority of customers moving. Yes, sure. And one of the things we're laser focused on right now is making the migration as repeatable as possible, and that's going to include some product work that we're doing to automate some of the migration. But it also includes scaling out the Vault CRM services team, and we have people now dedicated and focused to that. Part of this is focus pays off. And this is specific, the kind of thing that we think about when we think about executing really well. Part of our strategy is to execute really well in this area, and we're putting dedicated people on it. And that's going to help us create the focus but also the team to expand and scale and support customers as they -- we know roughly what that time line looks what we'll be ready to support it.  And I would say the third part of it is enabling our partner ecosystem. So we are working closely to make sure that they know what our role is and they know what their role is and how they can help us and how we can scale, support customers really across the globe. Remember, this is the U.S., it's Europe, it's Asia, it's LatAm. So we have a lot of customers, and we're making sure that we're ready with our own tooling, our services and our partners. Yes. quite good question. And every customer is unique. They're all in their own different stages, whether that's things related to their business or their pipeline or when they may have product launches. GSK and Bayer, we've had good, long-standing partnerships with both companies for a very long time. And they're thinking, they both had this idea of leading thinking. We want to put the decision-making process behind us, and we want to start focus on executing. They were confident they did their due diligence. They very quickly became very confident in their answer and their approach, so they wanted to put a clear stake in the ground and make that decision and communicate it and now shift into execution mode. So I would say just a strong partnership. We've delivered very well and consistently for them for a very, very long time. They trust Veeva. So they're ready to move forward.  In terms of other customers and the rest of the market, we're certainly in conversations with the rest of top 20, all of the large enterprise companies, of course, are small and medium-sized customers. Many of those conversations have started. It's not a mathematical thing. You won't see -- we know we have the next roughly 5 or 6 years, but it's not mathematical. It's dependent upon many different factors and variables. So I would think of it as we're in that early summer stage right now, and then over time, we'll start to see it ramp in.  And some of these, you may not see announcements. I think the way to think about it is we'll provide updates when there's kind of a material update to give. You may not see an announcement for every customer. But when there's something material, we'll kind of let The Street know. Yes. So we did have -- we had a good strong quarter with CRM overall. So we had 9 wins. And you're right, some of them are on Veeva CRM. And each of those is a discussion with the customer, and what's right for them and based on their timing. And yes, of course, that's the strategy is to -- they'll start on Veeva CRM. And then at some point before 2030, they'll move over to Vault CRM. And certainly, for some of these customers that are now doing Veeva CRM. That transition path becomes pretty clear and very, very clean. So they have full awareness and knowledge and that's part of the strategy. Yes. Sure we do pick one. We had a very lively Europe Summit. So and part of that is related to -- we now have our commercial products, our software products that are moving in all part of the all platforms. So that unlocks a lot of potential for us. So we were able to announce it. One is that Peter alluded to the service center demo. Remember, we announced that 5, 6 months ago at our U.S. Summit and now we demoed it live. So really strong execution that resonated really well. The announcements around marketing and outpatient CRM were some appreciated. And then in the data space, we had a new data announcement around Pulse data, and Peter talked a lot about that during our Investor Day. But more broadly, what we're doing in data, the innovation we're bringing in data by creating this common data architecture. So you asked for one thing, I gave you 4 or 5, but it was really kind of an action-packed summit with lots of announcements and we put a lot of momentum in multiple different areas. For sure -- and that -- and just to go into that a little bit deeper, that we're executing really well on the commercial content side and modular content. But as we think about what Vault allows us to do, it's bringing that content closer to the engagement channel. It's a platform that uniquely sorts both of those content and the engagement, whether it's the sales channel or field medical or even marketing in the future. So it's highly unique in that we're in a unique position to be able to solve that, that content distribution from the time frame in a very modular efficient way all the way to the time it gets out to the end customer, whether it's a marketing channel or a sales channel. So yes, that was also an exciting announcement."

If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Veeva disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We may discuss our guidance on today's call, but we will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. On the call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today's earnings release and in the supplemental investor presentation, both of which are available on our website. With that, thank you for joining us, and I'll turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you, Gunnar, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We had another strong quarter, delivering results ahead of guidance, including total revenue of $590 million and non-GAAP operating income of $212 million. In commercial, I'm excited about our first Vault CRM customer win and planned general availability date in April 2024. That's really strong progress by the Veeva team as we deliver the next generation of CRM. We also saw great activity in clinical, both with our established products and our newer products in clinical operations and clinical data management. At this point, we'll open up the call to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird. Your line is open.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Hi, everyone. I guess I wanted to start with the news this week on Vault CRM signing its first new customer. Really the question with the go-live later this year that does strike me as a bit earlier of a timetable. I think in the past, there was talk of 2024, maybe ahead of the Summit next year. So, if I'm right on -- maybe this being a bit earlier of a timetable. Just any views on why that might be the case? And then, does that at all influence kind of how you think about launch and strategy progressing from that point onward?\nPaul Shawah: Hey, Joe. Yeah, this is Paul. Thanks for the question. So, yes, we're certainly very excited to announce our first customer win. This is an early adopter. They will go live, that's the plan, in in Q4 of this year. It is a little bit earlier than we had expected. But Vault CRM is progressing really well. The product team has really delivered with excellence over the last year since we announced Vault CRM. So, we're excited with the progress. We're excited where we're headed. In terms of the timing, it's generally in line with what we talked about. So, we'll look at new -- all new customers after April next year. So that's what the general availability date means. We'll have our first migration starting in 2025, and we'll expect to migrate most of our customers in 2026 through 2028. So that fundamentally doesn't change that much. But yes, you're right, it's a good indicator of the progress we're making.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay, that's great. And then, just pertaining to the strength in EDC with the wins this quarter, and then really the highlighting of the broader clinical data management strategy in the prepared remarks. When you step back and look at all of this, would you say really no different than what Veeva has now done several times over its history in terms of product leadership, lighthouse account wins, and then building out the suite? Or just given the size and consequence of this category, would you maybe start highlighting different things in terms of strategy, the consequences going forward about your clinical data, specifically?\nPeter Gassner: I'll take that one, the broader clinical overall, which is clinical operations and clinical data management. They kind of -- they go together. A few high-level thoughts. When we start a new product area, we always have plans and we always try to do our best. And sometimes we achieve those internal goals for ourselves and sometimes we fall short. I think in the clinical area, we probably exceeded what we -- so far, what we thought we would set out to do. When we first got into our first pieces of clinical with CTM was really eTMF in 2012 and CTMS in 2016. So, we're a bit ahead. And then, all product areas are important, but clinical is just a very, very big one. So maybe in that way, it's a bit more important than others. A long way of saying we're really happy with our progress, and we've executed well. We've probably got some -- I had some good luck along the way as well, and now we just really have to focus on our customer success, and we'll do just fine.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Wong with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open.\nKen Wong: Great. Fantastic. This first question for Brent. Just wanted to understand the moving pieces on the billing side. Exceptionally strong in Q2, held the line for the full year. Just wondering if maybe some pull forward, some realignments. Like, what drove those moving pieces?\nBrent Bowman: Hi, Ken. It's -- yeah, I'll take that one. So, from a full year perspective, we reiterated the full year billings guide. So, we're growing at about 15%. What we've always said when you look at any one quarter, it can be -- it can move a little bit. So, in Q2, we're pleased to see some benefit from some linearity of some deals, so a little bit better deal timing. Those deals, we expected to close within the year, it just happened to close in Q2. So that's not going to impact the full year number, but we'd rather have the business earlier than later. So overall, happy with the execution.\nKen Wong: Got it. Makes a ton of sense. And then for Peter, just you guys touched on SMB softness. I think that's something you called out a year ago, but it did sound like it was more towards the commercial side when you first called it out. Would you say you've seen any impact or more meaningful impact on clinical, or is it held roughly the same in terms of how that SMB exposure has weighed on the business?\nPeter Gassner: Well, I think, we always knew that the macro would affect commercial and SMB, and particularly the smaller SMB, the emerging biotech, because when the funding environment is down, they might not be able to fund their clinical trials, get the money they need to expand. So overall, I would say, it's playing out as we expected, and that's -- I don't know when things would change. Who knows, right? They may change in the future, but you won't know that until they change. Right now, it's a business as we expected.\nKen Wong: Got it. Okay. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nRichard Poland: Hey, thanks for taking my question. This is Richard Poland on for Rishi. So, just one for me. On the China exposure that you called out in some of the prepared remarks, and you said that you kind of factored that into guidance. Just wanted to get a little bit of clarification on what exactly is factored into guidance on that side.\nPaul Shawah: Yeah. Hey, this is Paul. I can answer that. Just a little context. I think it might be helpful on China. This is regard -- in regards to some regulations that have come about over the last couple of years, which impact how data is transferred outside of outside of China, which starts to impact Veeva CRM. Veeva CRM is the predominant CRM that's used for most of the multinationals in the Chinese market. So, what it's doing is it's forcing them to rethink their solution. We have a solution for them in the Chinese market. That's our China SFA product. In terms of the size and the impact of this, this is not material. It's all factored in, but it's really not a material impact, either this year or next year. So, maybe that's how to think about it.\nRichard Poland: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Peterson with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nBrian Peterson: Hi, gentlemen. Congrats on the strong quarter. So, I wanted to double click on the Vault CRM. It was good to see the win this quarter. I'm curious, you did announce some other wins this quarter. As we progress towards GA, should we expect to hear more of the kind of net new CRM wins be Vault, or would they still kind of go with the Salesforce CRM? Any way to kind of level set expectations there?\nPaul Shawah: Yeah, it's a good question. And it will be customer specific. So, we'll think very deeply and work very closely with our customers. We're obviously very transparent about our direction. For some companies, Veeva CRM is the right thing to do, and that's what we will sell to them and work with them. But I do think it's a fair way to think about it as we get closer to that April date. And certainly after that April date, it'll start to become more Vault CRM and eventually all and exclusively Vault CRM for new -- so, that's for new customers.\nBrian Peterson: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dylan Becker with William Blair. Your line is open.\nDylan Becker: Hey, gentlemen. I appreciate you taking the question here. Maybe for Peter too, you emphasized the multi-product kind of strategy effort. It seems like as you guys are going wider, you're also going deeper functionally. I think you called out a number of new solutions that that have the potential to be larger markets than kind of what some of your respective offerings currently have. I guess, how do you think about that in context to the durability of kind of the growth equation and what Veeva can look like over time as you go deeper from a functional perspective?\nPeter Gassner: Thanks, Dylan. Yeah, it's really good way you said it. One of our special things is this multi-product company approach, our operating model that allows us to do that. So, excellence in an area like clinical or quality or safety, but because we have a lot of autonomy in those areas, we can go deep in those areas and provide the full suite of things, not just the surface level. So, if we look actually in clinical, there's not been a company that has attempted to do the full broad suite of clinical applications such as Veeva is trying. Nobody has attempted that before, let alone succeeded at it. So, it is absolutely our strategy to go in each area with autonomy, deep in each area with excellent applications, the main ones that people need, and then have things aligned across areas on a common set of values, how we operate as a company, how we strive for product excellence, how we do controls, and so that we see if we have some customer success issues and catch that. One of the reasons why we're durable is we're optimizing for the whole, and customers appreciate that. They know when we sell them, let's say, our RTSM solution, we care deeply about that success, not only for the reputation of our RTSM business, but for the reputation of the overall Veeva, which is much more than the RTSM business. So, in other words, we have more to lose if we have an unhappy customer in an area. So, we will work harder to protect that, which is what the customers want. And that's the beauty of our operating model.\nDylan Becker: Got it. That's super helpful. And then maybe just kind of piggybacking off of that too. I think the R&D Summit coming up here in a handful of weeks to support all of these kind of maturing product offerings, 2,000 attendees. I guess, is it -- maybe for Peter or Paul, highlight kind of the importance of what that event can mean as you build out that customer and product excellence into not only the existing platform set, but obviously some of these newer initiatives you guys are going after? Thank you.\nPeter Gassner: Yeah. Customer summit in Boston for R&D in U.S. coming up here in a couple of weeks. And we'll have about 2,000 people. It's absolutely one of our key reference selling events. Now reference selling goes on all the time across the globe every day, people talking to other people. \"Hey, what about those Veeva products? What do you think about that? Are you having a good experience? Not a good experience? I'm thinking about using it. What do you think?\" That's reference selling. But it happens really in a hurry in the customer summit, because there's 2,000 people and they're there. Their time is focused, and they have fortuitous run-ins with each other in the hallways, unplanned pollination, that's a little bit difficult to get without a physical event. And I think, you saw that, not just with Veeva, but with other companies. During the COVID crisis, there was initially a massive spread of information, everybody getting on zoom. But then after a while, you noticed the information didn't spread as much because there weren't these spontaneous interactions happening. So, you're right to say it's our massive cross-selling event.\nDylan Becker: Great. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan MacDonald with Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nRyan MacDonald: Hi, thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on a nice quarter. Peter, maybe first for you. Great to see the continued success with Compass patient and starting to get more wins there. Can you just talk about how you're sort of driving that success in an environment that seems to be quite tough in terms of data investment right now given the [tight] (ph) budgets?\nPeter Gassner: Yeah. For Compass, I'm very excited about that. Now in terms of the wins, those wins are going to happen. When -- there are a lot of companies wanting to buy a lot of data products, and sometimes they buy multiple data products. They might buy some data from Company A and some data from Company B and Company C, that's going to happen. So, the wins itself, they don't excite me that much, that's relatively easy to happen. What excites me is our product vision and the product team needs put together and the goal we're setting out. We're setting out to have a unique, highly-integrated, highly-excellent suite of data products from Compass to Link to OpenData, and to be the leader in life sciences data. Nobody else has set out to do that over the last -- as far as I know, over the last 20 years, because [IQVIA is unquestioned] (ph) leader. So, we're setting out to do that. And then, we have this product team in architecture that's really clean. It's making a clean new way thing. It's sort of like there's a client server and we're coming out with cloud. We're coming out with something fundamentally cleaner. And the real thing is getting the enthusiasm from the early customers, hearing not so much what they're saying, but why they're saying it. So the early intuition here is that it could be something great if we execute well.\nRyan MacDonald: Maybe just a quick follow-up on that. I mean, from the customers you've won so far, do you get the sense that they're sort of committed and bought into the broader product strategy with the additional datasets coming out where you can start to have, take that multi-product adoption to sort of consolidate more on Veeva? Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: No, I wouldn't say the customer is rightly so or committed yet. I do think they see the potential. This might be really good. This could be very differentiated. There's potential here, and I should keep my eyes on it. But I would -- no one committed because we haven't released these major products, which are Compass Prescriber and Compass National. So, we have to deliver those. Customers have to start working with them or to delivering them with quality month after month after month after month. That's how people really get enthused about it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. Your line is open.\nTyler Radke: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. So, if I look at the full year guidance, obviously a lot of the metrics stayed pretty unchanged. It did look like you slightly took up the commercial guidance. But in the quarter, it seemed like R&D, at least, outperformed consensus. So, I know it's not big changes, but could you just talk to the modest changes you're expecting for the full year outlook? And I guess to the extent macro is impacting the business, are you seeing it more in R&D versus commercial? Thank you.\nBrent Bowman: Yeah. So -- hey, Tyler. So, what we did is we increased our full year subscription guide by about $5 million. So that was driven in the commercial space. So what we saw in the commercial space is we saw some favorable linearity with some deals closed a little bit earlier. So that's what you're seeing kind of flow through to the full year. R&D, it basically played out exactly as expected. So, we're executing well there, and the linearity of the deals are as expected. So that's kind of what you see from a subscription perspective. The macro, again, no [serial] (ph) surprises. When we set out the year, we said it was going to be a continuation of what we have been seeing, so not better, not worse. And we saw that in the first half, and we expect that in the second half as well.\nTyler Radke: Got it. And maybe another follow-up for you, Brent. As I think about the billings guidance and your expectations for normalized billings versus calculated billings, I think last quarter, you were expecting more of a headwind on the normalized billings about a $8 million headwind. This quarter, it seemed like it maybe turned out to be a tailwind, if I'm reading those signs correctly. Could you just talk through kind of what you saw in the quarter from a normalized billings perspective that differed relative to your original guidance, and I guess if there's any changes for the full year? Thank you.\nBrent Bowman: Yeah. So, from a normalized billings, so just to make sure we're level set, so what we're doing there is for our renewal business, we normalize for changes in frequency. That's when the customer goes from annual to quarterly or vice versa, and also for things like co-terms. So, for that renewal business, that's what we're focused on is taking that noise out of the equation. So, looking at normalize is the best way to look at the number. Now there's always going to be movements between calculating that because what a customer may co-term or change that, so those term -- billing term changes is what you're seeing there. But that doesn't impact the normalized number. That's just an adjustment to calculate it. So, I wouldn't be so worried about that $8 million versus $3 million. I'd look at the full year. The full year, we're going at 15% and we feel good about it.\nTyler Radke: Great. Thank you.\nBrent Bowman: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nBrent Bracelin: Thank you. Good afternoon. Maybe first for Peter. I wanted to double click into the clinical data management space. I mean you talked about some pretty strong momentum with ePRO and RTSM. I think you framed that as an opportunity bigger than EDC. What are the catalysts that you think can drive broader adoption of ePRO and RTSM? Are we in an environment where this is still largely a push, or are we starting to see kind of customer pull?\nPeter Gassner: Good questions. RTSM and ePRO, first, I would say, there are areas where -- these are two areas where life sciences is going to be cautious. The randomization and trial supply management, that's very, very critical. If that's done incorrectly, you could have patient safety problems. You could wipe out a significant part of the investment in your whole trial. So they're going to be cautious. The companies are going to try some trials first and see how it goes, rightly so. And in the ePRO area that patient reported outcomes, that's patient-facing things. So again, they're going to be extra sensitive on that. So, I think the way it will play out is, people experimenting at first trial at a time, and if they like it, they'll try a little more. And if they like it -- what we see may happen over the coming years play out is they might look for an enterprise standard, for example, an enterprise standard for randomization and trial supply management, and they really haven't done that before because of way the market dynamics have been. They can would pick randomization and trial supply management on a trial-by-trial basis and have multiple vendors almost as if they were using a contract research organization. Our innovation and the way we're doing it, we're set up for scale such that a company might say, \"You know, hey, I'm going with Veeva with all my trial for randomization and trial supply management.\" And in ePRO over time, that may also play out as well, where they could use is not selecting on a trial by trial who has the best ePRO for this or for that. We would like to, over time, earn the right to have an enterprise agreement. That's one for the ePRO. And then the second, we're a big fan of what's called bring your own device, meaning that the patient would use their own web browser or their own iPhone, their own Android and put their own app on it rather than the pharmaceutical company provisioning a specific iPad application. So, we've done a lot of things to make that happen and make that work really well, which, by the way, of course, you couldn't do 10 years ago when ePRO started, but you couldn't do that. So, we're taking a new approach. We think it's better -- that will take time for it to work its way through the system and the company's sponsors and CROs to get comfortable with that. So, we're taking an innovative approach and we hope to have innovative results.\nBrent Bracelin: Got it. Very clear. And if you become the standard, obviously, a lot to gain there. My last question for Brent here. If I just look at net cash, it's on pace to eclipse $4 billion for the first time in the second half of the year. You're now looking at generating $1 billion in cash flow annually here. What are the plans for that excess cash position? Is there an opportunity to maybe accelerate your product plan that's ambitious with more tuck-ins? How do you think about that $4 billion in the second half, going to $5 billion end of next year, and what the appropriate uses for that cash would be? Thanks.\nBrent Bowman: Yes, sure. So, Brent, yes, so you're right, we run a profitable business, and we're generating a good amount of cash, and we're at about $3.9 billion. But we're focused on M&A. M&A is a use of cash. If we see the right acquisition, that's what we're going to do. But as always, in Veeva fashion, we're going to be disciplined about it in our strategy, in our approach. And we have done a few deals in the past, and we've been successful in those deals. So that's really our focus, Brent, right now is to really invest for growth and M&A is a big part of that.\nBrent Bracelin: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Wallace with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nJack Wallace: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Brent, first one for you, diving into the rest of your billings guide. Am I right by inferring here that it looks like there's a little bit of a mix shift towards more subscription billings versus services and the read there would be from the services guide to the lower half of the prior range? And then within that, is that -- if that is the case, is that related to some of the larger deals that you're either signed this year or anticipate to sing later in the year that may need less of Veeva resources during implementation?\nBrent Bowman: Yes, there's a few moving pieces there. Like if you take a big step back on in the area here, services, was down a little bit. So that will have a small impact, a small impact on billings. But what you saw happen in Q2 was some favorability, right? So, the visibility we have to the business is still the same visibility. It's just we closed some deals a little bit earlier. And that takes some of the pressure of that half when you look at the growth rate. So, we're very happy with the visibility we have and the growth rates we see in that business, which is -- in that metric, which is 15%.\nJack Wallace: Excellent, thanks. And then Peter and Paul, your question about the kind of competitive landscape in commercial. What have we seen since last quarter in terms of activity from Salesforce and essentially even IQVIA in and around the public migration taking place?\nPaul Shawah: Yes, I can talk about that. So, we haven't -- as it relates to Salesforce, really business as usual. They've been a good partner. They continue to support our existing customers. I expect they're going to continue to do that through the end of our agreement. So that's business as usual as far as that goes. In terms of them in the competitive landscape, I can't comment on their direction, their plans. What I can tell you is this is really hard building a pharma CRM. It's a really deep life sciences specific application. It's complex. It's different and different parts of the globe. Brazil is different than Japan is different than Italy. So, it's really a -- it's a different beast from what Salesforce is accustomed to doing. And then there's the full commercial cloud. So we have CRM. We have full commercial cloud. There's software, there's data. They all interoperate and work together, and nobody else really has that. So, as far as my perspective on Salesforce, I don't see this as an attractive market for them. You asked about IQVIA also, nothing has really changed there. We haven't seen any difference. We still win most of the deals. We won eight SMBs in the quarter. Maybe one thing to think about as you kind of think about the longer term here, also one data point to put things into perspective. Veeva CRM and our add-ons is roughly 25% of our total revenue. And we expect to move the vast majority of that over to Vault CRM over, let's say, the next five years. So just a way to frame kind of what that looks like, yes, there's the competitive landscape and that may change, but that's how we're thinking about it. We expect to move the vast majority over and focus on our boards, and that's the next generation CRM.\nJack Wallace: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just a quick last one here. What should we be anticipating in terms of the migration costs maybe on the back end side versus also the implementation side?\nPaul Shawah: I'm sorry, can you repeat -- you're talking about the migration path? Can you just repeat the question, just to understand?\nJack Wallace: The cost for migrating customers, just incremental to the existing expense base.\nPaul Shawah: Got it. Yes, costs for migrating, so the way to think about it is the cost -- there's a lot of variables that are going to go into what that cost looks like. And one big one will be the approach that customers take from a very lift and shift to something that may be more optimizing around business process. The way I would think about it is we're building a lot of the tools to make that migration a whole lot easier. So the cost of just moving a Vault CRM, I estimate could be 20% of the total cost of trying to do something new, and build some new offering. So, we have a significant advantage because our customers are going to get everything we've delivered in Veeva CRM, in Vault CRM on day one. That's what happens with our existing customers, plus they'll get more on top of that. So it's a much more efficient way and it's a much better way. Ultimately, we'll deliver a better application.\nJack Wallace: Thank you so much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nCraig Hettenbach: Yes, thank you. In R&D, can you touch on the ramping nature of some of the larger wins in EDC? And how do you think about that in terms of layering on to the growth rate?\nPeter Gassner: Brent, do you want to take that one?\nBrent Bowman: Yes, I'm happy to -- yes, I'm happy to take that one. So, if you think about these large EDC deals, these are not single-year deals. These are these multi-year arrangements, which could be three, four, five years. So think about them in the first year, it's not going to be a significant amount. And as you get into years three, four, and five, it will become much more material. Revenue will follow that billings path as well. So those two will be aligned as you look forward. That's kind of a way to think about it.\nCraig Hettenbach: Okay. And then just switching gears back to some of the questions on the data business in commercial. Can you touch on just how you're thinking about just from a timeline perspective when you could see some inflection in that business?\nPeter Gassner: I'll take that one. Real inflection, I do think will be -- first, it's going to be customer success wise and product excellence. And that, I think, we'll have a pretty good view about 12 months from now, really. Now that is going to lead the financial significance by a long way. So it will be multiple years from now before -- Compass is not going to be a [$60 million] (ph) business, even a [$50 million] (ph) business. It's not going to be that anytime soon, anytime in the next few years. So that's how long of a path these things are. The leading indicator will be the customer success and the customers and that would start probably with a very small biotechs who can -- who would say, \"Hey, I run my business, and I don't use any IQVIA data products. That's -- I just use the Veeva data products. That's -- and I'm happy with that. And I'm able to see things that I couldn't see before.\" That's when you know you have something. So that -- those are the things that we're really looking for every day trying to optimize for, trying to listen for, trying to make changes, so we can arrive at that next year.\nCraig Hettenbach: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jailendra Singh with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nJailendra Singh: Thank you, and congrats on a strong quarter. First, I want to better understand the margin trends in the quarter, which came in nicely ahead of your quarterly guidance when you adjust for TFC and FX impact. Just trying to understand what drove the upside there? And it looks like you're only raising the EBIT guide for the full year to reflect outperformance in the quarter. So, how are you thinking about those cost trends in the second half?\nBrent Bowman: Yes, thank you. So, we're really happy with the performance in Q2. And you're right, we did flow through that outperformance in op income about $10 million to the full year. So, we increased our full year number by 10%. So, growing at 38% in the quarter, and that's really about just great focused execution across everyone at Veeva, all functions. So really good execution. And so, we're real pleased with that. And if you look at our full year guide, we're guiding to about 37%. Remember, there's a little bit of seasonality in Q4. But other than that, it's just purely about execution, and we're going to continue to focus on investing in areas that make sense that can accelerate our value to our customers.\nJailendra Singh: Okay. And then following up on the question on macro front, asked earlier with respect to the funding environment, putting pressure on smaller biotech companies. I understand your fiscal '24 guidance does not assume any change there. But what are you assuming in your fiscal '25 outlook? Are you assuming any improvement in trends there? And then my broader question on macro is that I completely understand that Veeva products are core to pharma R&D, but some of your peers and competitors have been talking about shrinking R&D budgets for pharma and cut down on discretionary spending. What gives you comfort that these trends will not start spilling over to your focus area? Just trying to understand the comfort there.\nBrent Bowman: Yes. Let me take the first one. So in our guidance, we've assumed that the macro environment will continue. So, we don't expect it to get better nor do we expect it to get worse. Fiscal year '25 is long ways out, but that's our base assumption as you think about our guide.\nPaul Shawah: I'll take the second part of that. The life sciences industry is a healthy industry. There's always going to be some level of ups and downs in a quarter -- quarter-to-quarter as it relates to clinical trial activity. But as we look out over the next couple of years, we're seeing growth in R&D budgets on average around 3% growth in R&D spend. So it's a healthy industry, you'll certainly see a little bit of kind of ups and downs. And as far as that impact on our business, I don't expect that to be material, given where that focus is on the smaller segment of our business, and we're a little bit more ELA centric.\nJailendra Singh: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stan Berenshteyn with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nStan Berenshteyn: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. In the prepared remarks, you called out Veeva Link as contributing to commercial subscription growth in the quarter. Brent, could you maybe give us an update on the ARR under Link? And then, Peter or Paul, can you share with us what are some of the newer products under Link? Thanks.\nBrent Bowman: Yeah. So, I'm not going to get into specific ARR values, but just -- what's important is Link is a big opportunity for us. We're executing well. Our first application Link for Key People is getting really good traction, and you're seeing that as a driver to our revenue growth. So, it's one of the -- that is one of the primary drivers you saw in Q2 and for the balance of the year from a commercial revenue growth perspective.\nPeter Gassner: This is Peter. I'm sorry. I'll talk about the -- sorry for the audio there. I had a little issue. This is Peter. I'll talk about Link overall. We started out with Link for Key People. And when we were building that, we were also building the Link platform, so that we could expand it to different solution areas and you're seeing that. You started seeing that last year. So, Link for Key Accounts, for [Multiple Countries] (ph), Link for Scientific Awareness, for Medical Insights, Link Workflow. And then over into the clinical area, we've announced Link TrialBase and Link SiteBase. So, we've really announced a broad, broad set of products. Now each of those products, they're going to take a long time to mature, as Brent said. The bulk of our Link revenue, I don't have the exact number, but let's say probably more than 90% right now, is in the Link for Key People. We think it can be a broad, broad set of solutions that can add significant value. But we'll have to see. We'll have to see, can we make excellent applications and make customers happy. We're very mature in Link Key People. A lot more customers to sell into. The product is very mature, by far the market-leading product. We have to see if we can get there with our other Link products.\nStan Berenshteyn: Got it. And then maybe just a quick one on Crossix. Obviously, that's a choppier business quarter-to-quarter, but can you share with us any trends you're seeing as it relates to pharma marketing activities and demand? Thanks.\nPeter Gassner: Marketing, no broad level trends that we haven't seen before, just increased scrutiny. Marketing is a spend, and I would say there's increased scrutiny, especially more than it was a couple years ago. But it continues to go well for us at Crossix. And it's going to have its ups and down quarter-to-quarter. But as companies, they want to reach their customers, in the U.S., specifically in two ways: face to face and through digital. And they're always going to use both methods and digital marketing is a big part of it. Crossix is the leading measurement solution. So, I think you have a good long-term business there. Our focus is to integrate Crossix more tightly with CRM, so that it becomes more towards enterprise license agreements and it became -- comes a little bit less of a standalone measurement tool.\nStan Berenshteyn: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is open.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Apologies in advance if these questions have been asked, but I'm going to try it anyway. Peter, maybe first for you. Great to see the growth in the EDC customer base. I think we said we added eight, right, in the quarter. Maybe the question for you is, are there any commonalities that you're seeing across some of those wins? Whether it's coming from one or two specific competitors or maybe a common reasoning that you're seeing those customers choose to switch Any observations that that you would make just as you look at a bigger EDC customer base now?\nPeter Gassner: Yeah, there are some commonalities. I would say, the bulk of them are either coming from Medidata, which is the leading by volume in industry solution, or they're coming from a series of small competitors that are targeted for the SMB. As it relates to Medidata, I would say, they're like the EDC solutions from Veeva, but they also like the integration with our clinical operations suite. In the [EAC] (ph) solution, why they like our solution better at times -- sometimes is, and that'll be the primary driver, it -- specific, what I call, meat and potatoes things. For example, when you do a study amendment, you change the design of the study many times with competitive solutions, you have to unload the data, reload the data. The site can't -- the clinical research site can't operate during time. With Veeva, because there's a newer architecture, that doesn't happen. We also are able to -- through the use of our tooling, our customers can build their studies, can define their studies dramatically faster. It might do four weeks instead of eight weeks. And then, the way that Veeva system works has less custom programming. There's custom programming needed in these other solutions that is expensive, but also [indiscernible] specialized skill. You don't need that. You can define that and leave it. So these very specific things. And then as to why they would use Veeva instead of maybe smaller SMB solutions, I think, again, they would like to get solutions from one partner that fits together. And that's what we do. A good example of that is we have a great clinical trial management system and we have a great EDC system. You don't have to use both. If you use both, they're better together. Our ePRO system and our RTSM system, they work fine if you don't have our EDC. They don't require our EDC at all. Their best stand alone, and nobody else has done that before, right? Nobody else that has an EAC product. But if you have all of our products, the integration is even better, and it's just easier to get these solutions from -- an integrated solution from one company. So that's what we're seeing. People want a broad clinical partner where all of the applications are excellent, and that's what they can find in Veeva.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. That makes a lot of sense. Brent, maybe for my follow-up for you, and, again, apologies if this has already been asked. But some competitors during the quarter talked about maybe some lower clinical trial volume just kind of industry wide, and that potentially impacting their revenue. Maybe just to level set for all of us, can you just remind us how much of Veeva's business, if any at all, is dependent on sort of near-term in-quarter clinical trial volume that we could sort of get a sense for Veeva's exposure to that potential trend?\nBrent Bowman: Hi, Saket. So, minimal -- a very small amount is going to be variable based on near-term trial volumes. If you think about our six top 20 EDC wins, those are typically multi-year predefined ramping deals. So, they're going to -- they're not going to move with the ebb and flow of a near-term trial volume. So, I would say that has a minimal impact in kind of how we go to market and contract with our customers.\nSaket Kalia: Very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, this is Carly on for Brad. I know we talked about just the fiscal year guidance, I guess the implied Q3 guidance kind of assuming current macro to continue. I just want to dig in a little deeper into, I guess, specific cohort or product wise. I know you guys pointed out smaller biotech customers impacting the R&D business. But just wondering, going forward, looking at the second half, what segments do you expect to be impacted more than the other, perhaps and maybe some that are going to recover sooner than the other, which will offset some of that weaker macro. Yes, I just want to like learn -- dig into a little deeper into nuances here.\nBrent Bowman: Yes. So, starting from the top, the macro, again, we expect it to be a continuation of what we saw in the first half and the back half. If you look at our full year guide and you look at R&D, we're growing that business at about 28% adjusted for termination for convenience. So that's a very healthy business, growing nicely, and we continue to execute, and we see the strength to be broad-based across clinical, quality, and safety in the rest of the businesses in regulatory. So broad-based strength there. The macro was going to impact both commercial and R&D, but nothing more than what we've been seeing. So, we're happy with the execution we have broadly across the portfolio.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And then just a follow-up for me, if I may. You definitely have broad solutions stack, 35 products. Just looking beyond the macro here, perhaps fiscal year '25, you reiterate $2.8 billion target. So just wondering, in your broad product suite, are there any ramping more meaningfully in the pipeline that might contribute more to the growth going forward?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. So, we reiterated the $2.8 billion. We're not going to get into specific splits of the product portfolio. But as Peter has indicated in his prepared remarks, we're less than 20% penetrated broadly and across R&D. So the beauty of being a multi-product company and have 35-plus major products is you have broad-based strength, and that's what we're seeing. We see a broad opportunity and it's up to us to execute to that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen -- TD Cowen, sorry. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Lucas on for Charles. Most of our questions have been asked. So, I guess a longer-term question around Vault CRM. As we understand it, bringing the CRM product on to your own platform, give you guys the ability to develop some add-ons or added functionality that your customers may be currently going to other vendors for. So two questions, I guess. Would like to hear what sort of functionality this may entail, maybe that's asking too far down the roadmap, but would be curious to hear how you guys are thinking about this opportunity. And then two, is the timeline for when you guys may look to add such functionality?\nPaul Shawah: Yes. Hey, Lucas, this is Paul. So the way I would think about it, first and foremost, the decision was mainly about having complete control over the platform, the application, so we can deliver on customer success. That's the highest level. We want to make sure that we can do what we need to do to deliver the very best application and the best customer experience. That's the decision at the highest level. Now beyond that, that means we may be able to unlock new functionality, and we've announced some of that already. I'm not going to introduce new announcements or new things that we may do in the future. But one really interesting one that's been really well received by our customers is this idea of how do we help the industry become more service-centric, enabling some of these new therapies, new complex medicines, complex therapies, it's important for doctors to be able to get information inbound from life sciences. And service center will allow them to do that. So that's just one example. I would expect -- our model is we continue to innovate. So I would expect that over time, we'll do new things on Vault CRM that we haven't done before. But that's standard Veeva operating model.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Appreciate it. That was it. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back to Peter for closing remarks.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today, and thank you to our customers for your continued partnership and to the Veeva team for your outstanding work in the quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Brent Bowman",
            "content": "Hi, Ken. It's -- yeah, I'll take that one. So, from a full year perspective, we reiterated the full year billings guide. So, we're growing at about 15%. What we've always said when you look at any one quarter, it can be -- it can move a little bit. So, in Q2, we're pleased to see some benefit from some linearity of some deals, so a little bit better deal timing. Those deals, we expected to close within the year, it just happened to close in Q2. So that's not going to impact the full year number, but we'd rather have the business earlier than later. So overall, happy with the execution. Yeah. So -- hey, Tyler. So, what we did is we increased our full year subscription guide by about $5 million. So that was driven in the commercial space. So what we saw in the commercial space is we saw some favorable linearity with some deals closed a little bit earlier. So that's what you're seeing kind of flow through to the full year. R&D, it basically played out exactly as expected. So, we're executing well there, and the linearity of the deals are as expected. So that's kind of what you see from a subscription perspective. The macro, again, no [serial] (ph) surprises. When we set out the year, we said it was going to be a continuation of what we have been seeing, so not better, not worse. And we saw that in the first half, and we expect that in the second half as well. Yeah. So, from a normalized billings, so just to make sure we're level set, so what we're doing there is for our renewal business, we normalize for changes in frequency. That's when the customer goes from annual to quarterly or vice versa, and also for things like co-terms. So, for that renewal business, that's what we're focused on is taking that noise out of the equation. So, looking at normalize is the best way to look at the number. Now there's always going to be movements between calculating that because what a customer may co-term or change that, so those term -- billing term changes is what you're seeing there. But that doesn't impact the normalized number. That's just an adjustment to calculate it. So, I wouldn't be so worried about that $8 million versus $3 million. I'd look at the full year. The full year, we're going at 15% and we feel good about it. Sure. Yes, sure. So, Brent, yes, so you're right, we run a profitable business, and we're generating a good amount of cash, and we're at about $3.9 billion. But we're focused on M&A. M&A is a use of cash. If we see the right acquisition, that's what we're going to do. But as always, in Veeva fashion, we're going to be disciplined about it in our strategy, in our approach. And we have done a few deals in the past, and we've been successful in those deals. So that's really our focus, Brent, right now is to really invest for growth and M&A is a big part of that. Yes, there's a few moving pieces there. Like if you take a big step back on in the area here, services, was down a little bit. So that will have a small impact, a small impact on billings. But what you saw happen in Q2 was some favorability, right? So, the visibility we have to the business is still the same visibility. It's just we closed some deals a little bit earlier. And that takes some of the pressure of that half when you look at the growth rate. So, we're very happy with the visibility we have and the growth rates we see in that business, which is -- in that metric, which is 15%. Yes, I'm happy to -- yes, I'm happy to take that one. So, if you think about these large EDC deals, these are not single-year deals. These are these multi-year arrangements, which could be three, four, five years. So think about them in the first year, it's not going to be a significant amount. And as you get into years three, four, and five, it will become much more material. Revenue will follow that billings path as well. So those two will be aligned as you look forward. That's kind of a way to think about it. Yes, thank you. So, we're really happy with the performance in Q2. And you're right, we did flow through that outperformance in op income about $10 million to the full year. So, we increased our full year number by 10%. So, growing at 38% in the quarter, and that's really about just great focused execution across everyone at Veeva, all functions. So really good execution. And so, we're real pleased with that. And if you look at our full year guide, we're guiding to about 37%. Remember, there's a little bit of seasonality in Q4. But other than that, it's just purely about execution, and we're going to continue to focus on investing in areas that make sense that can accelerate our value to our customers. Yes. Let me take the first one. So in our guidance, we've assumed that the macro environment will continue. So, we don't expect it to get better nor do we expect it to get worse. Fiscal year '25 is long ways out, but that's our base assumption as you think about our guide. Yeah. So, I'm not going to get into specific ARR values, but just -- what's important is Link is a big opportunity for us. We're executing well. Our first application Link for Key People is getting really good traction, and you're seeing that as a driver to our revenue growth. So, it's one of the -- that is one of the primary drivers you saw in Q2 and for the balance of the year from a commercial revenue growth perspective. Hi, Saket. So, minimal -- a very small amount is going to be variable based on near-term trial volumes. If you think about our six top 20 EDC wins, those are typically multi-year predefined ramping deals. So, they're going to -- they're not going to move with the ebb and flow of a near-term trial volume. So, I would say that has a minimal impact in kind of how we go to market and contract with our customers. Yes. So, starting from the top, the macro, again, we expect it to be a continuation of what we saw in the first half and the back half. If you look at our full year guide and you look at R&D, we're growing that business at about 28% adjusted for termination for convenience. So that's a very healthy business, growing nicely, and we continue to execute, and we see the strength to be broad-based across clinical, quality, and safety in the rest of the businesses in regulatory. So broad-based strength there. The macro was going to impact both commercial and R&D, but nothing more than what we've been seeing. So, we're happy with the execution we have broadly across the portfolio. Yes. So, we reiterated the $2.8 billion. We're not going to get into specific splits of the product portfolio. But as Peter has indicated in his prepared remarks, we're less than 20% penetrated broadly and across R&D. So the beauty of being a multi-product company and have 35-plus major products is you have broad-based strength, and that's what we're seeing. We see a broad opportunity and it's up to us to execute to that."

            "name": "Peter Gassner",
            "content": "Thank you, Gunnar, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We had another strong quarter, delivering results ahead of guidance, including total revenue of $590 million and non-GAAP operating income of $212 million. In commercial, I'm excited about our first Vault CRM customer win and planned general availability date in April 2024. That's really strong progress by the Veeva team as we deliver the next generation of CRM. We also saw great activity in clinical, both with our established products and our newer products in clinical operations and clinical data management. At this point, we'll open up the call to your questions. I'll take that one, the broader clinical overall, which is clinical operations and clinical data management. They kind of -- they go together. A few high-level thoughts. When we start a new product area, we always have plans and we always try to do our best. And sometimes we achieve those internal goals for ourselves and sometimes we fall short. I think in the clinical area, we probably exceeded what we -- so far, what we thought we would set out to do. When we first got into our first pieces of clinical with CTM was really eTMF in 2012 and CTMS in 2016. So, we're a bit ahead. And then, all product areas are important, but clinical is just a very, very big one. So maybe in that way, it's a bit more important than others. A long way of saying we're really happy with our progress, and we've executed well. We've probably got some -- I had some good luck along the way as well, and now we just really have to focus on our customer success, and we'll do just fine. Well, I think, we always knew that the macro would affect commercial and SMB, and particularly the smaller SMB, the emerging biotech, because when the funding environment is down, they might not be able to fund their clinical trials, get the money they need to expand. So overall, I would say, it's playing out as we expected, and that's -- I don't know when things would change. Who knows, right? They may change in the future, but you won't know that until they change. Right now, it's a business as we expected. Thanks, Dylan. Yeah, it's really good way you said it. One of our special things is this multi-product company approach, our operating model that allows us to do that. So, excellence in an area like clinical or quality or safety, but because we have a lot of autonomy in those areas, we can go deep in those areas and provide the full suite of things, not just the surface level. So, if we look actually in clinical, there's not been a company that has attempted to do the full broad suite of clinical applications such as Veeva is trying. Nobody has attempted that before, let alone succeeded at it. So, it is absolutely our strategy to go in each area with autonomy, deep in each area with excellent applications, the main ones that people need, and then have things aligned across areas on a common set of values, how we operate as a company, how we strive for product excellence, how we do controls, and so that we see if we have some customer success issues and catch that. One of the reasons why we're durable is we're optimizing for the whole, and customers appreciate that. They know when we sell them, let's say, our RTSM solution, we care deeply about that success, not only for the reputation of our RTSM business, but for the reputation of the overall Veeva, which is much more than the RTSM business. So, in other words, we have more to lose if we have an unhappy customer in an area. So, we will work harder to protect that, which is what the customers want. And that's the beauty of our operating model. Yeah. Customer summit in Boston for R&D in U.S. coming up here in a couple of weeks. And we'll have about 2,000 people. It's absolutely one of our key reference selling events. Now reference selling goes on all the time across the globe every day, people talking to other people. \"Hey, what about those Veeva products? What do you think about that? Are you having a good experience? Not a good experience? I'm thinking about using it. What do you think?\" That's reference selling. But it happens really in a hurry in the customer summit, because there's 2,000 people and they're there. Their time is focused, and they have fortuitous run-ins with each other in the hallways, unplanned pollination, that's a little bit difficult to get without a physical event. And I think, you saw that, not just with Veeva, but with other companies. During the COVID crisis, there was initially a massive spread of information, everybody getting on zoom. But then after a while, you noticed the information didn't spread as much because there weren't these spontaneous interactions happening. So, you're right to say it's our massive cross-selling event. Yeah. For Compass, I'm very excited about that. Now in terms of the wins, those wins are going to happen. When -- there are a lot of companies wanting to buy a lot of data products, and sometimes they buy multiple data products. They might buy some data from Company A and some data from Company B and Company C, that's going to happen. So, the wins itself, they don't excite me that much, that's relatively easy to happen. What excites me is our product vision and the product team needs put together and the goal we're setting out. We're setting out to have a unique, highly-integrated, highly-excellent suite of data products from Compass to Link to OpenData, and to be the leader in life sciences data. Nobody else has set out to do that over the last -- as far as I know, over the last 20 years, because [IQVIA is unquestioned] (ph) leader. So, we're setting out to do that. And then, we have this product team in architecture that's really clean. It's making a clean new way thing. It's sort of like there's a client server and we're coming out with cloud. We're coming out with something fundamentally cleaner. And the real thing is getting the enthusiasm from the early customers, hearing not so much what they're saying, but why they're saying it. So the early intuition here is that it could be something great if we execute well. No, I wouldn't say the customer is rightly so or committed yet. I do think they see the potential. This might be really good. This could be very differentiated. There's potential here, and I should keep my eyes on it. But I would -- no one committed because we haven't released these major products, which are Compass Prescriber and Compass National. So, we have to deliver those. Customers have to start working with them or to delivering them with quality month after month after month after month. That's how people really get enthused about it. Good questions. RTSM and ePRO, first, I would say, there are areas where -- these are two areas where life sciences is going to be cautious. The randomization and trial supply management, that's very, very critical. If that's done incorrectly, you could have patient safety problems. You could wipe out a significant part of the investment in your whole trial. So they're going to be cautious. The companies are going to try some trials first and see how it goes, rightly so. And in the ePRO area that patient reported outcomes, that's patient-facing things. So again, they're going to be extra sensitive on that. So, I think the way it will play out is, people experimenting at first trial at a time, and if they like it, they'll try a little more. And if they like it -- what we see may happen over the coming years play out is they might look for an enterprise standard, for example, an enterprise standard for randomization and trial supply management, and they really haven't done that before because of way the market dynamics have been. They can would pick randomization and trial supply management on a trial-by-trial basis and have multiple vendors almost as if they were using a contract research organization. Our innovation and the way we're doing it, we're set up for scale such that a company might say, \"You know, hey, I'm going with Veeva with all my trial for randomization and trial supply management.\" And in ePRO over time, that may also play out as well, where they could use is not selecting on a trial by trial who has the best ePRO for this or for that. We would like to, over time, earn the right to have an enterprise agreement. That's one for the ePRO. And then the second, we're a big fan of what's called bring your own device, meaning that the patient would use their own web browser or their own iPhone, their own Android and put their own app on it rather than the pharmaceutical company provisioning a specific iPad application. So, we've done a lot of things to make that happen and make that work really well, which, by the way, of course, you couldn't do 10 years ago when ePRO started, but you couldn't do that. So, we're taking a new approach. We think it's better -- that will take time for it to work its way through the system and the company's sponsors and CROs to get comfortable with that. So, we're taking an innovative approach and we hope to have innovative results. Brent, do you want to take that one? I'll take that one. Real inflection, I do think will be -- first, it's going to be customer success wise and product excellence. And that, I think, we'll have a pretty good view about 12 months from now, really. Now that is going to lead the financial significance by a long way. So it will be multiple years from now before -- Compass is not going to be a [$60 million] (ph) business, even a [$50 million] (ph) business. It's not going to be that anytime soon, anytime in the next few years. So that's how long of a path these things are. The leading indicator will be the customer success and the customers and that would start probably with a very small biotechs who can -- who would say, \"Hey, I run my business, and I don't use any IQVIA data products. That's -- I just use the Veeva data products. That's -- and I'm happy with that. And I'm able to see things that I couldn't see before.\" That's when you know you have something. So that -- those are the things that we're really looking for every day trying to optimize for, trying to listen for, trying to make changes, so we can arrive at that next year. This is Peter. I'm sorry. I'll talk about the -- sorry for the audio there. I had a little issue. This is Peter. I'll talk about Link overall. We started out with Link for Key People. And when we were building that, we were also building the Link platform, so that we could expand it to different solution areas and you're seeing that. You started seeing that last year. So, Link for Key Accounts, for [Multiple Countries] (ph), Link for Scientific Awareness, for Medical Insights, Link Workflow. And then over into the clinical area, we've announced Link TrialBase and Link SiteBase. So, we've really announced a broad, broad set of products. Now each of those products, they're going to take a long time to mature, as Brent said. The bulk of our Link revenue, I don't have the exact number, but let's say probably more than 90% right now, is in the Link for Key People. We think it can be a broad, broad set of solutions that can add significant value. But we'll have to see. We'll have to see, can we make excellent applications and make customers happy. We're very mature in Link Key People. A lot more customers to sell into. The product is very mature, by far the market-leading product. We have to see if we can get there with our other Link products. Marketing, no broad level trends that we haven't seen before, just increased scrutiny. Marketing is a spend, and I would say there's increased scrutiny, especially more than it was a couple years ago. But it continues to go well for us at Crossix. And it's going to have its ups and down quarter-to-quarter. But as companies, they want to reach their customers, in the U.S., specifically in two ways: face to face and through digital. And they're always going to use both methods and digital marketing is a big part of it. Crossix is the leading measurement solution. So, I think you have a good long-term business there. Our focus is to integrate Crossix more tightly with CRM, so that it becomes more towards enterprise license agreements and it became -- comes a little bit less of a standalone measurement tool. Yeah, there are some commonalities. I would say, the bulk of them are either coming from Medidata, which is the leading by volume in industry solution, or they're coming from a series of small competitors that are targeted for the SMB. As it relates to Medidata, I would say, they're like the EDC solutions from Veeva, but they also like the integration with our clinical operations suite. In the [EAC] (ph) solution, why they like our solution better at times -- sometimes is, and that'll be the primary driver, it -- specific, what I call, meat and potatoes things. For example, when you do a study amendment, you change the design of the study many times with competitive solutions, you have to unload the data, reload the data. The site can't -- the clinical research site can't operate during time. With Veeva, because there's a newer architecture, that doesn't happen. We also are able to -- through the use of our tooling, our customers can build their studies, can define their studies dramatically faster. It might do four weeks instead of eight weeks. And then, the way that Veeva system works has less custom programming. There's custom programming needed in these other solutions that is expensive, but also [indiscernible] specialized skill. You don't need that. You can define that and leave it. So these very specific things. And then as to why they would use Veeva instead of maybe smaller SMB solutions, I think, again, they would like to get solutions from one partner that fits together. And that's what we do. A good example of that is we have a great clinical trial management system and we have a great EDC system. You don't have to use both. If you use both, they're better together. Our ePRO system and our RTSM system, they work fine if you don't have our EDC. They don't require our EDC at all. Their best stand alone, and nobody else has done that before, right? Nobody else that has an EAC product. But if you have all of our products, the integration is even better, and it's just easier to get these solutions from -- an integrated solution from one company. So that's what we're seeing. People want a broad clinical partner where all of the applications are excellent, and that's what they can find in Veeva. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today, and thank you to our customers for your continued partnership and to the Veeva team for your outstanding work in the quarter. Thank you."

            "content": "Hey, Joe. Yeah, this is Paul. Thanks for the question. So, yes, we're certainly very excited to announce our first customer win. This is an early adopter. They will go live, that's the plan, in in Q4 of this year. It is a little bit earlier than we had expected. But Vault CRM is progressing really well. The product team has really delivered with excellence over the last year since we announced Vault CRM. So, we're excited with the progress. We're excited where we're headed. In terms of the timing, it's generally in line with what we talked about. So, we'll look at new -- all new customers after April next year. So that's what the general availability date means. We'll have our first migration starting in 2025, and we'll expect to migrate most of our customers in 2026 through 2028. So that fundamentally doesn't change that much. But yes, you're right, it's a good indicator of the progress we're making. Yeah. Hey, this is Paul. I can answer that. Just a little context. I think it might be helpful on China. This is regard -- in regards to some regulations that have come about over the last couple of years, which impact how data is transferred outside of outside of China, which starts to impact Veeva CRM. Veeva CRM is the predominant CRM that's used for most of the multinationals in the Chinese market. So, what it's doing is it's forcing them to rethink their solution. We have a solution for them in the Chinese market. That's our China SFA product. In terms of the size and the impact of this, this is not material. It's all factored in, but it's really not a material impact, either this year or next year. So, maybe that's how to think about it. Yeah, it's a good question. And it will be customer specific. So, we'll think very deeply and work very closely with our customers. We're obviously very transparent about our direction. For some companies, Veeva CRM is the right thing to do, and that's what we will sell to them and work with them. But I do think it's a fair way to think about it as we get closer to that April date. And certainly after that April date, it'll start to become more Vault CRM and eventually all and exclusively Vault CRM for new -- so, that's for new customers. Yes, I can talk about that. So, we haven't -- as it relates to Salesforce, really business as usual. They've been a good partner. They continue to support our existing customers. I expect they're going to continue to do that through the end of our agreement. So that's business as usual as far as that goes. In terms of them in the competitive landscape, I can't comment on their direction, their plans. What I can tell you is this is really hard building a pharma CRM. It's a really deep life sciences specific application. It's complex. It's different and different parts of the globe. Brazil is different than Japan is different than Italy. So, it's really a -- it's a different beast from what Salesforce is accustomed to doing. And then there's the full commercial cloud. So we have CRM. We have full commercial cloud. There's software, there's data. They all interoperate and work together, and nobody else really has that. So, as far as my perspective on Salesforce, I don't see this as an attractive market for them. You asked about IQVIA also, nothing has really changed there. We haven't seen any difference. We still win most of the deals. We won eight SMBs in the quarter. Maybe one thing to think about as you kind of think about the longer term here, also one data point to put things into perspective. Veeva CRM and our add-ons is roughly 25% of our total revenue. And we expect to move the vast majority of that over to Vault CRM over, let's say, the next five years. So just a way to frame kind of what that looks like, yes, there's the competitive landscape and that may change, but that's how we're thinking about it. We expect to move the vast majority over and focus on our boards, and that's the next generation CRM. I'm sorry, can you repeat -- you're talking about the migration path? Can you just repeat the question, just to understand? Got it. Yes, costs for migrating, so the way to think about it is the cost -- there's a lot of variables that are going to go into what that cost looks like. And one big one will be the approach that customers take from a very lift and shift to something that may be more optimizing around business process. The way I would think about it is we're building a lot of the tools to make that migration a whole lot easier. So the cost of just moving a Vault CRM, I estimate could be 20% of the total cost of trying to do something new, and build some new offering. So, we have a significant advantage because our customers are going to get everything we've delivered in Veeva CRM, in Vault CRM on day one. That's what happens with our existing customers, plus they'll get more on top of that. So it's a much more efficient way and it's a much better way. Ultimately, we'll deliver a better application. I'll take the second part of that. The life sciences industry is a healthy industry. There's always going to be some level of ups and downs in a quarter -- quarter-to-quarter as it relates to clinical trial activity. But as we look out over the next couple of years, we're seeing growth in R&D budgets on average around 3% growth in R&D spend. So it's a healthy industry, you'll certainly see a little bit of kind of ups and downs. And as far as that impact on our business, I don't expect that to be material, given where that focus is on the smaller segment of our business, and we're a little bit more ELA centric. Yes. Hey, Lucas, this is Paul. So the way I would think about it, first and foremost, the decision was mainly about having complete control over the platform, the application, so we can deliver on customer success. That's the highest level. We want to make sure that we can do what we need to do to deliver the very best application and the best customer experience. That's the decision at the highest level. Now beyond that, that means we may be able to unlock new functionality, and we've announced some of that already. I'm not going to introduce new announcements or new things that we may do in the future. But one really interesting one that's been really well received by our customers is this idea of how do we help the industry become more service-centric, enabling some of these new therapies, new complex medicines, complex therapies, it's important for doctors to be able to get information inbound from life sciences. And service center will allow them to do that. So that's just one example. I would expect -- our model is we continue to innovate. So I would expect that over time, we'll do new things on Vault CRM that we haven't done before. But that's standard Veeva operating model."

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Gunnar Hansen, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nGunnar Hansen: Good afternoon, and welcome to Veeva's fiscal 2024 first quarter earnings conference call for the quarter ended April 30, 2023. As a reminder, we posted prepared remarks on Veeva's Investor Relations website just after 1:00 p.m. Pacific today. We hope you have had a chance to read them before our call. Today's call will be used primarily for Q&A. With me today for Q&A are Peter Gassner, our Chief Executive Officer; Paul Shawah, EVP, Commercial Strategy; and Brent Bowman, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding trends, our strategies and the anticipated performance of the business, including guidance regarding future financial results. These forward-looking statements will be based on our current views and expectations and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the risks listed in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our most recent filing on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements made during this call are being made as of today, May 31, 2023 based on the facts available to us today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Veeva disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We may discuss our guidance on today's call, but we will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. On the call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe aid in the understanding of our financial results. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics can be found in today's earnings release and in the supplemental earnings investor presentation, both of which are available on our website. With that, thank you for joining us, and I'll turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Gassner: Thank you, Gunnar, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We had a great start to the year, delivering results ahead of guidance with total revenue coming in at $526 million. The macroeconomic environment was stable and it was another quarter of strong execution across R&D and Commercial. In Commercial, development of Vault CRM is on track, and we gave a compelling demo at Summit. We expect to have our first customers live on Vault CRM early next year. We also announced two new Compass data products in our first AI application, CRM Bot for Vault TRM. We also saw continued momentum in Development Cloud across all areas. Our product strategies in R&D and Commercial are clear and compelling, and we have a long runway of growth ahead. At this point, we'll open up the call to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink of Baird. Please go ahead.\nJoe Vruwink: Hi, great. hi, everyone. Maybe just to start off, the Commercial Summit a few weeks ago. Curious to hear feedback from customers and partners on what they saw and liked or maybe didn't like out of Vault CRM. And any key messages out of the summit that maybe help inform or change, how you're thinking about introducing the product starting 2024 and into 2025.\nPaul Shawah: Hi Joe, this is Paul. Thanks for the question. So Summit was great. We had nearly 2,000 people there. It was a great event. It was our first showcase of Vault CRM. We demoed to a broad audience and generated a lot of excitement. I'd say there was a couple of specific things that our customers were excited about. First is the idea that they're going to get the full functionality of everything we've delivered in Veeva CRM over the past 15 years. All of that plays forward into Vault CRM. So what that means for our customers is they never have to go backwards. They -- everything they've invested in they'll get the advantage of. So full functionality was a really big value prop for our customers. I would say number two is the big announcements that we have. Service Center, which is for inside sales reps and hybrid reps. These are people that need access to the core Veeva CRM functionality, but they also need access to things like handling inbound calls and cases. So they're excited that this is all going to be part of one application, but also CRM Bot, which is super exciting. You saw some of Peter's remarks about generative AI, and this is going to be the first application that we're building. It's going to be part of Vault CRM. So that generated a lot of excitement. And then I guess maybe the third thing was the approach we're taking to helping the industry move to Vault CRM. So same application, same data model, helping customers move their data, their configuration. They're excited about how we're going to help them make the transition. So overall, really positive events, a lot of really positive feedback on our direction in Vault CRM.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. That's all great. Thanks Paul. And then maybe just on the macro. It's been a few quarters now where Veeva has ultimately macro meeting your expectations. I guess, sitting here on the outside the macro and things like biotech funding, it seems pretty dynamic over that same stretch of time. Is the delta here, just maybe Veeva's opportunity? Is it your execution? How do you maybe reconcile kind of those two comments?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, I'll take that one. This is Peter. In general, the industry operates on pretty long cycles, especially our very established and large customers. So the ups and downs of the macro environment don't really affect them too much. We do see a little bit more effect in what we call our emerging biotech. These are small customers, generally don't have an approved product. So we see -- when funding gets tight, we see a little bit of pressure there. But nothing that really has changed in the last 90 days at a macro level. So I guess that's why we're not so susceptible to those small ups and downs and business just continues to move forward.\nJoe Vruwink: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ken Wong of Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead.\nKen Wong: Hi, fantastic. This first question is for Brent. Just wanted to ask about unbilled AR, saw a big spike up on the cash flow. What drove that? And how should we think about that trajectory? Is it just going to be a tailwind until the balance sheet runs to zero? What's the right mapping on that?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. So a couple of things there. On the unbilled AR, I think there was a decline, right? So in that part of what you're seeing there was on the termination for convenience playing through. But on the OCF line, overall, we're really pleased with our strong execution in the quarter. On a full year basis, we've increased the number by $30 million. So we're at $840 million, which is growing about 20%. So I feel really good about the execution and -- for the quarter and for the outlook for the year.\nKen Wong: Got it. So it wasn't any kind of abnormal contract, this was kind of how you expected it to play out with the removal of -- or the inclusion of the TFCs?\nBrent Bowman: Absolutely correct. So from a TFC perspective, just put it in complete context, we know what we expect to happen, happened in Q1 and what we expected to happen for the full year is still intact. So no surprises.\nKen Wong: Got it.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Peterson of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nBrian Peterson: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one for Paul. So Paul, I think there's been some debate on -- at least from investors, on how customized some of the CRM implementations are and how big of a lift it may be to actually migrate over to Vault. Has there been any feedback on that so far? And I also would love to understand there was a comment in the prepared remarks that you expect to have some early customers live at the Summit next year. How is that trending relative to your expectations? Thanks guys.\nPaul Shawah: Yes. Brian, thanks for the question. Yes, so the way I would think about it is some companies have adhered pretty close to what Veeva delivers kind of standard in our standard product or have done relatively straightforward configurations and other companies have done more customizations, particularly some of the larger companies. So -- and then there's different ways to make the move to Vault CRM. So one way is to just do in a sense, a technical migration. And then another way is to think about changing process, business process change as they make that transition. So the level of complexity of the move is going to depend on how much customization they've done, but also the approach that they're taking to move over, if they're going to change process or if they're just going to keep things and just do a simple technical migration. So lots of variables going on there. But what we are doing is we're trying to make it as easy as possible for our customers. And we made some really important design decisions to try to make that simple. Keeping the data model the same, keeping the application the same, moving all of their data for them, moving their configuration for customers. So we're automating as much of a move as possible. Now you're right, we did talk about early customers going live potentially as early as our Summit next year. Likely what those will be, will be some net new customers. For example, this quarter, we announced 11 new SMB wins, it would likely be a company like that, that would go live in that first move. And then I would expect migrations to happen starting in 2025. So the first customers who are on Veeva CRM moving over to Vault CRM starting in 2025, with most of those still happening in the 2026 to 2029 frame.\nBrian Peterson: Great. Thanks Paul.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nRichard Poland: Great. Thanks. This is Rich Poland on for Rishi. So first question would just be on the 2026 to 2029 time frame. Just curious with some of the new functionality that you're adding into the platform like the bots as well as the service center, should we think about that as being something that could help those migrations happen a little bit earlier on that curve? Is that something that's kind of, I guess, specific to the Vault platform?\nPaul Shawah: Yes, you're right. Those announcements will be specific to the Vault platform. So will be service center that will be part of the Vault CRM application and also the same with CRM all be part of Vault CRM. So there may or may not be additional incentive for customers to move. But I can tell you that based on the feedback that we've heard from Summit customers are excited about both of them are excited about those opportunities. And that was the promise. The promise was they get the full functionality of Veeva CRM. They get a deep market-leading application and they're going to get new innovation over time.\nRichard Poland: Great. Thank you. And then just a follow-up. On some of the -- I know Compass with all of the, I guess, new data personas that have been added there. It seems like you're now kind of ready to take on the incumbents in that space and the messaging has kind of come across that in the past two quarters. So am I thinking about that right? And how should we think about the time line, I guess, for starting to really attack that opportunity?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. That's the right way to think about the full suite of data products for the Commercial area and a streamlined, simplified suite of data products. One thing you could compare it to, it's a different domain, but in our quality area, and that's something we've had for many years now, and we introduced QualityDocs, document management system, regulated content management system. We have QMS, which is a structured data quality management system, and we have training. It all fits together on a unified data model on one common platform. That's what we're doing for Compass. So we have patient now, which is the anonymous patient data, 60 billion rows of patient data in the U.S. about prescriptions, procedures, diagnoses. Now what we're adding in January is Compass Prescriber and Compass Sales, and those are projected data products about prescribers' prescribing patterns, the individual prescribers and also at the Zip and State level and the national level. So they all sit together on one common data model. They're separate products, very separate different purposes. So for the first time in January, we'll have this suite of products. And I think that's what customers will find compelling. And then just like we always do, we have to get a customer to have all three of those products, have to get them live using it, have to get them happy, round off the corners, have to get them talking to other customers. And that's one thing about competition. Usually the best product and the best service will win. And when you look at Compass and how we talk to customers there, our message is pretty simple. It's about better data and better service. And so it's just an execution game. I feel very comfortable about our product strategy. It feels so similar to what we've done in some of our Vault suites before, and now it's just down to executing.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Dylan Becker of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nDylan Becker: Hi, guys. Appreciate for taking the question and really, really nice job here. Maybe, Peter, I wanted to hone in on two comments in the prepared remarks. First, you talked about kind of serving as the AI focal point for the industry. I know you rolled out CRM Bot, but wondering how you're thinking about the long-term optionality there to utilize AI and machine learning models to automate these key processes. Again, you have highly specialized unique data that gives you a holistic view through the Commercial, the clinical and the Compass kind of data sets. So wondering how you're thinking about the evolution of the AI capabilities over time?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. We -- I like our position as it relates to AI because we're a core system of record. So that's something you're always going to need. I think that's one thing that people should always understand. Core system of records will be needed even in the world of AI. If I ask Brent, hey, Brent, do you think 10 years from now, you'll need a financial system to manage your financials. He's going to tell me, yes, I really need one, you can't take it away. ChatGPT won't do it for me, right? I'm making a joke there, but our customers have the same critical operational systems around drug safety, around clinical trials, around regulatory, around their quality processes. So those are always going to be needed. Now we are also building our data assets, and these are proprietary data assets, Link, Compass and we're building more data assets. Those will also be not affected by AI, but AI will be able to leverage those assets and make those assets more valuable. So I think we'll develop more -- we'll do basically three things. We'll develop more applications over time. CRM Bot the first. We got to get that right. We also will -- our proprietary data will get more valuable. And the third thing we'll do is make our applications fit very well when customers have their own proprietary AI applications. So especially the Vault platform, we'll do a lot of work in there to make it fit really well with the other AI applications they have from other vendors or that they develop themselves, because it's an open ecosystem, and that's how that's part of being Veeva. We are this broad platform for the customers, and we're an ecosystem in which they can plug in their own intelligence and their own partnerships. So I'm really excited about how AI is going to play out for Veeva. It's very clear what we need to do.\nDylan Becker: That's crystal clear, and I appreciate the color there. Maybe another one, too, and maybe just kind of piggyback off that a little bit. But I think there was a comment around the innovation engine being as strong as ever at Veeva today, too, which is, again, impressive given the historical track record of the business. I wonder, is this a function of the relative kind of maturation of some of these larger opportunities like Compass clinical data, safety, quality, et cetera, that you've been able to maybe scratch the surface on and now dig deeper in with those customers. Maybe how that pairs with the customers that are now increasingly look to you for standardization and maybe opening up their road maps and saying, hey, here's how I want to develop the plan with Veeva? Thank you, guys.\nPeter Gassner: Yes, two things. I think the main thing is we're getting very good at being a multiproduct company. We've been working on that for -- we've been in business for, what, 16 years now. We've been a multiproduct company, really, I guess, since 2012-ish, something like that. So more than 10 years now. We have a lot of products. And we're getting good at it in our operating model, how we manage economy, what roles and responsibilities are. And there's a lot of people in Veeva that know that operating model and know how to fit into it. So 6,000 people at Veeva, so we can do more parallel processing. And we just keep doubling down and getting better at being a true great multiproduct company, which is relatively rare here. And then -- so that's, I would say, the macro level. That's what I mean by our innovation engine. For instance, we have people at Veeva now other than me, who are good at overseeing others, who are doing the innovation. So we have that level of scale, and it's relatively rare. Now also, we have deeper customer relationships than we've ever had, and that just really helps, because you get the benefit of the doubt when you have that customer relationship, you get early customers faster, you get more clear feedback. And I would say, the third thing is also when we make an innovation, we're often making an integration to our existing products. So if you look at, for example, our safety product, it's a very good product on its own. But the promise of having it integrated into our clinical products, that's an advantage that another company doesn't have, if they're just starting up a safety product on their own. So long-winded answer there, but it is an insightful question, something I'm very proud of our innovation engine. It's very rare.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nCraig Hettenbach: Yes, thank you. Just following up on the macro commentary, are you able to provide some context just the rough exposure to emerging biotech, given that's kind of a source of debate in terms of funding. And then more broadly, I think last year, you talked about in the SMB space kind of impact to add on just kind of what you're seeing on that front.\nBrent Bowman: Sure, Craig. This is Brent. I'll take that. Yes. So as Peter mentioned earlier, we're not -- we don't have a significant exposure to the emerging biotech. And if you think about it in terms of total revenue, it's about 4%. So kind of you can think about that. And that's comprised of about 1,000 employees with no approved product. So that kind of gives you some context of that part of the business. And then your second question, Craig, I want to make sure I get it right?\nCraig Hettenbach: Just on SMB more broadly in terms of the macro, just maybe some impact to add on kind of what you've been seeing recently.\nBrent Bowman: Yes. So over the last 90 days, we really haven't seen a significant change in the macro. So we -- it continues to be impacted, but we factored that all into the guide, and we're executing well in that area.\nCraig Hettenbach: Got it. And then just a quick follow-up for Peter, just on the Sanofi announcement recently. And more broadly, kind of what's resonating in the R&D space and what that means for your target, the multiyear target of a 30% CAGR, how are you feeling about that?\nPeter Gassner: Sorry, I didn't catch that question about which announcement.\nCraig Hettenbach: The Sanofi announcement?\nPeter Gassner: Okay. And that one, I know we do a lot of work with Sanofi. I don't know the specifics of the announcement. Paul, do you -- are you more in...\nPaul Shawah: Yes, I think you're I think you're probably referring to the Sanofi quality announcement where they've adopted our quality documentation, quality management suite. Is that...\nCraig Hettenbach: Yes.\nPaul Shawah: So I think what you're seeing there, first of all, we're excited about quality. It's a significant market. We've introduced a lot of new applications and innovation in there. And this is another good example of that unified quality suite, that value proposition playing through. And I think that's what Sanofi saw. They're trying to streamline and modernize their quality processes, and they're standardizing on bot quality to do that. So super exciting, a good example of another large company kind of in a sense going all in to modernize the quality of manufacturing process.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nHannah Rudoff: Hi, guys. This is Hannah Rudoff on for Brent today. Thanks for taking my question. Just first one for you, Paul. I guess are there customers that are waiting for all three of your Compass products to BGA before adopting them as a full suite rather than just adopting one at a time?\nPaul Shawah: We have been -- the way we announced and launched this, we focused in on patient data. So we're focused in on customers that can get started relatively quickly, and they're exploring, they're testing our patient data. Most of them are finding that, to Peter's point earlier, it's actually better data. They're getting a broader view into the market. They're finding more patients, they're finding more doctors. So that's the very specific market segment that we've been focused on. We haven't been focused on trying to sell the full suite, because it hasn't been available yet. So I wouldn't say that companies are holding back, because we're not really focused on that part of the market yet. Now given the fact that we're not that far away from having that full set of products, by January of next year, we'll have everything we need to be a full replacement. It will open up a broader part of the market.\nHannah Rudoff: Okay. Makes sense. And then second one for you, Brent. How are you thinking about the monetization of your CRM Bot product and then any future AI products release?\nBrent Bowman: Yes, it's really early right now. We're focused on ensuring that we have the right product working with our customers. So that's our focus right now. Let's get the product right, and then we'll get into more of the details on kind of the sizing and the opportunity there. But we're excited overall about the opportunity we have in front of us.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ryan MacDonald of Needham. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Matt Shea on for Ryan. I wanted to start with some of the new applications you guys announced around Vault CRM, the service center and the CRM Bot. I know at the service center and you announced it would be free, but the CRM bought, it's not clear if it will be free. So do you plan on monetizing the CRM Bot or some of your other generative AI investments in the future? And as we think about likely additional applications you add around the CRM, do you view this as a lever to potentially increase revenue per account over time or more so as a retention tool as you go through the replatforming on to Vault?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, I can take that one. So if we start with Service Center, that's included in Veeva CRM. It will probably result in more CRM licenses over time, because maybe somebody that was a pure inside sales rep, maybe they didn't use Veeva CRM, some type of thing like that. So it's included in the license, but it may mean more users. CRM Bot will -- that's not an included product so that will have a license that will most likely be licensed by the user. So that will be net new. But as Brent mentioned, we're focused on getting the product right and we don't have pricing for that or sizing for that yet.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That's helpful. And then with your data assets, Link and Compass, what has been the selling point when competing against some of the other data incumbents? Has service quality and integrations across the broader platform, but enough to displace existing vendors or do you anticipate being competitive on price as well? Just would love to get some of your strategic go-to-market thinking around those data assets.\nPeter Gassner: With Link, which we've had for a while, specifically Link key people, that's it's often somewhat of a new category for customers. This is real-time customer intelligence. So either they did it internally or they had a vendor that was sort of substandard in that area. So it's kind of there, we're kind of creating the market and teaching people, here's the value you can get with a data asset like that. And that then is continuing on as we broaden out the Link suite, the Link for key accounts and then we're bringing out for clinical trials and preclinical research sites. So that's more of an education campaign. For Compass, yes, that's a direct replacement where the major incumbent there is IQVIA. And IQVIA has a set of data products, there are quite a few that they've built up over the -- over time. And there, it's more simple, hey, we have a more modern solution, fewer moving parts. They can probably save some money on that. But that -- I don't think that's the primary reason that would go with us. It'd be a more modern product that works for more complex medicines better data and better delivery, but that one is the replacement. Just like originally, when the company started, there was a SebelCRM that was from Oracle that was a dominant market leader in Pharma CRM. And that was a replacement job, replacement parts. Veeva CRM is better. It's cloud, it's better out with Sebel and with Aviva. This is going to be a similar type of thing out, with the IQVIA for that data and with Aviva. No. Make no mistake, that's hard work, right? We have to execute well to make that happen.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is [Kelly Valenti] on for Gabriela. Can you provide some visibility into fiscal year '25 last year? Can you just walk us through under what circumstances that outlook could turn out to be too bullish? Or in what circumstances you would kind of exceed that outlook? And how your visibility into that now -- compares now to last quarter?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. So thanks for the question. So looking out at fiscal year '25, we reiterated our guidance. So at least $2.8 billion and at least $1 billion in operating income. And we're expecting that the current macro situation is constant. There's no change. There's no improvement. It doesn't get worse. So that's kind of our assumption as we look out in time. So we're excited about the opportunities. We're early days in a large market opportunity, and that's the best look of the business we have right now.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then I want to circle back to the Merck partnership you announced last year. I realize it's still early days with that, but are you seeing any impact to Veeva's business as a result of that partnership either from a product roadmap perspective or any additional product adoption for Merck?\nPeter Gassner: I'll take that one. I couldn't comment on specifics of Merck product adoption. I would really say that the partnership is working. We're thrilled with the partnership, I think Merck is getting value from it by a very open relationship with Veeva that's helping to transform their business to be more digital and data driven. We're certainly getting value out of it, because we're learning how to manage a customer with a true, true partnership like that, that starts at the CEO level. So we are rethinking about what's possible. I don't -- it's not shaping our product strategy so much as specifically what we'll do and what products. But I think it is shaping our delivery strategy and how we manage and partnership and partner with customers because it's a whole different selling notion. It's a more -- it's not a selling notion. It's a partnership notion. So I couldn't be more happy with that. To me, it's one of the highlights of our year.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jack Wallace of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nJack Wallace: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about the competitive environment for the CRM business. It has been six, seven months since the announcement to move to your own platform. What have you seen so far from your larger -- your other competitors, Salesforce and IQVIA? Thank you.\nPaul Shawah: Yes, Jack. I can take that. So we still see IQVIA pretty consistently. We also see regional competitors. None of that has changed. We continue to compete with them. We win most of the time. I'm excited about the 11 new wins that we've added in the quarter. So we're continuing to add customers in a pretty tight environment. So I'm excited about our progress, our execution in CRM. With regard you asked about IQVIA, you asked about Salesforce also, I'll give you some commentary on Salesforce. It's been six months since we made that announcement, the partnership, the way we're working together to support joint to support our joint customers is working well. I'm not surprised by that, but I'm pleased that, that's continuing. So we continue to work well together from an operational day-to-day standpoint. I would add the -- maybe the one thing that's changed is Salesforce does have the technically the right to compete with us in the pharma CRM space. We did terminate -- we announced terminating our agreement with them. There's language in the contract, which gives them that right. So I guess, maybe that's a little bit of a difference, but the reality is, I guess, maybe the bigger picture is the space needs pharma CRM. We're the market leader in this space for a reason. We've invested a lot in building a very, very deep industry-specific applications. And I haven't seen any competitor, any company really go down that path. Nobody is there, and nobody is really even close to that. So we continue to focus on customer success, continuing to innovate and really enabling that very deep functionality for the industry. So pleased where the competitive environment is.\nJack Wallace: Thanks. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up to that, the wins in the quarter, particularly the competitive wins for those in North America and Europe or most of those in the Latin America and Asia where you're still muscling out local players?\nPaul Shawah: Most of them were in North America. There were a couple in one or two, I believe, in Europe, but the majority were in North America. And these are -- most of them are also companies commercializing for the first time. There were a couple of competitive displacements that we had. So companies that had existing products like IQVIA, and we replaced them. So it's a bit of a mix, but biased more towards the U.S. market.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jailendra Singh of Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nJailendra Singh: Thank you. And Thanks for taking my questions. I want to go back to discussion around macro environment. In your prepared remarks, you called out the funding environment continuing to put pressure on project scrutiny. Can you give a little bit more color there? What kind of projects are being scrutinized? Is it across the board or specific to certain type of solutions? Are you seeing these projects getting like pushed out to a later date or getting canceled? And what does your guidance assume in terms of these projects going through?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. Our - so we haven't seen any real changes in the last 90 days. If you compare with two years ago, for example, funding environment is tighter. It's not as easy for small biotech to get funding at the valuations that they want and project screening is tighter. It's not as easy for large companies to justify spending for the future because they're a little more apprehensive about the curve. So -- but none of that has changed in the last 90 days, and it's been included in our guidance. And you asked specifically how does that project scrutiny play out? Honestly, just extra scrutiny. Let's say they're going to -- it doesn't depend on product area. It could be in the quality area, in the CRM area and the safety and the regulatory area, and there's just extra scrutiny. This project is going to be done, how much is the budget for this project. When is the ROI going to happen for our company and just double check that. Now with that project scrutiny, we do -- our projects generally do pretty well on that. What has not done well is companies that focus on more discretionary spend or more just one-off project type of stuff. That doesn't do well, and you'll see a lot of those companies having more issues. But ours are -- our projects are investment in core capabilities that people need for the long term, and those tend to be a little more thoughtful and go through.\nJailendra Singh: Yes, that's really helpful.\nPeter Gassner: I'd say, to put a clear point of that experimentation, there's less experimentation going on now than there was two years ago. And that's due to more scrutiny.\nJailendra Singh: Okay. That makes sense. And then a quick follow-up on normalized billings quarterly cadence. Now kind of we can calculate what the growth is for embedded in fiscal Q3 number. Can you remind us on the drivers behind the growth acceleration you expect from what you expect in Q2 fiscal quarter to Q3? And of course, we have talked about Q4, but just curious like if you can remind us on the growth drivers for billings in the second half?\nBrent Bowman: Yes, sure. And so yes, so we're providing normalized billings to try to take some of the noise out of the equation for you. So to anchor on a full year basis, we increased our number by $5 million. So that's growth of about 15%. So real pleased with the execution there. Specifically to Q3, what you've seen in some of our newer business, the underlying renewal base has shifted a bit. So it was shifting away from the first half more to the back half, Q3, Q4. So that's part of why you're seeing an acceleration in the billings growth. Also the price increase CPI will start to come into play in Q3 and Q4 as well. So those are a couple of the contributors and why we are confident in the acceleration in the back half of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Peter, maybe for you, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the clinical data management business a little bit, and maybe specifically, whether you think some of the displacements, which have been great by the way, for -- I think it was six of the top 20. Whether some of those displacements are adding more value and potentially higher revenue run rates than what customers were paying for before? Does that sort of make sense? Like do you feel like Veeva EDC is kind of replacing what a customer had before kind of one for one? Or do you find that Veeva is able to add more value and maybe comment a little bit more?\nPeter Gassner: Yes, I think we're able to add more value because we're modernizing. So if you look in the clinical data management area, one of the core areas of that are our EDC, electronic data capture. We're able to -- customers are able to build their clinical studies faster. So that means getting that clinical studies going faster, and they're being able to do their amendments to studies without downtime, without data unloads. So that means they can work better with their clinical research side. Those are just a couple of the examples. So it's a better system that helps them with their efficiency. In terms of what they pay for it, I think they probably pay us actually a little bit less usually. I mean it depends, right? Our customers are all over the map with the different competitors. But maybe on the average, they pay us a little bit less, but I think their cost is significantly less because they have to put less people -- manpower on it. So we always want to do that. We want to deliver more value at a lower price. We want to innovate and make things better and more efficient. So we want to share some -- in some of that return, but the customer -- the industry gets some of that return. And then if you look at the clinical data area, one point I want to bring up. We have two top 20 customers now that have our clinical data management and our safety product only two, and only one of them is live with both and just recently live both. Now what we'll do here over the next 12 months is develop a highly efficient integration between those systems. Highly efficient and standardized integration at the business process level. The industry hasn't seen that before, because no companies had both of those systems, clinical data management and a drug safety system. That efficiency, the customers are just going to get and it's going to make the industry just much, much more efficient. So that's what we always want to do. Charge less, deliver more and run a real profitable business.\nSaket Kalia: Yes, absolutely, it shows. Brent, maybe for my follow-up for you, very helpful answer, by the way, before just on the billings acceleration in the second half. I have a little bit more of a mechanical question, which was just the normalized billings and calculated billings. I think there was a minor difference between the two before. Now we're thinking about them being roughly equal. Just for our own sort of notification, can you just go on a little deeper just into what changed, if anything, around your expectations on billings terms that maybe make both of those now a little bit more similar than what you were thinking before?\nBrent Bowman: Yes, happy to, Saket. So first, what are we normalizing? So what we're normalizing is for our remote business, if there's a change in frequency or a co-term. So we have a view entering the year what that's going to look like for the full year. So once we got into Q1, there were a few customers where they had changing billing terms. So basically, those new deals offset what we thought before. So on a full year basis, calculated billings and normalized billings are one and the same. You're going to have differences quarter-to-quarter, but for the full year, it nets out.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Stephanie Davis of SVB Securities. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Davis: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I just want to follow up on the Salesforce questions that you had a little bit earlier. Asked in another way, what has feedback been so far from your client base about the transition off of the platform and into your new in-house platform? Is it apparent on the radar yet?\nPaul Shawah: Yes. I mean for -- it is a topic of conversation, certainly with our larger customers, the global customers, companies in the large enterprise, they're focused on this. This is something that they know they're going to have to do at some point and focus on over the next several years. Remember, customers have through 2030, but for some of these large companies, this is a big deal. They have to make sure that they plan and think about this. So we're working very closely with all of our large customers to help them understand the implications, what it means for them, but also the benefits that they get out of this. So I think there's a lot of -- the last six months was about understanding what does this mean and the rationale. And I think the Summit helped with that, having them see it and understand that it's real and understanding that there's a path forward. And that they're ultimately going to get a new level of innovation for them. Now there's certainly going to be work to do to get there. Our customers will have to -- this will be projects for our customers. It's on us to make sure that we minimize the size of that. And certainly, relative to doing some other alternatives that doesn't really exist in the market today. This will be a whole lot easier. So that's how they're thinking about it. They're helping, the last six months was about digesting and understanding and now appreciating some of the innovation we're going to deliver over time.\nStephanie Davis: All right. Helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on billings. You had the $5 million of normalized billings this quarter. Could you kind of parse out the unbilled receivables, takedown benefit, the benefit from some of the new clients that you called out? And how are you bridging that growth rate to the acceleration in the second half to 18%?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. So if we kind of maybe just break it down to what happened in Q1. So from a Q1 perspective, we had a nice beat and a portion of that was from more annual billers than we expected. And then part of it was the underlying strength in the business. So we slowed that through. The unbilled AR that you foresee, like that question you asked me had no impact on how we look at the full year normalized billings. So -- but there's not a direct impact there.\nStephanie Davis: Awesome. Thanks folks.\nBrent Bowman: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Please go ahead.\nTyler Radke: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to come back to the Compass suite. It sounds like you're expecting some customers next year at your Summit to be rolled out on that product. Is that going to be kind of net new customers similar to the 1G you referenced in terms of adopting the Vault CRM suite or are you actively engaging in customers who look to be displacing IQVIA and rolling out on the Compass suite?\nPeter Gassner: I think it will be a mix. It may be a mix of a particular brand, maybe for our patient product in a large customer, it could be in the top 20. But for a full replacement sort of being IQVIA free, that will come from a small customer, whether they're existing or a brand-new customer, that will come from a company that sort of maybe has one brand, whether just precommercial, that were not quite ready to launch. That will be the pattern, which is very similar to what we see in many of our products, right? Continue for a smaller, more nimble company to just go all in with Veeva.\nTyler Radke: Got it. That's helpful. And then on the R&D side, you talked about a lot of nice wins in EDC and the broader clinical suite. I was wondering if you could just talk about the trends you're seeing in CDMS, and I believe you have had some product and sales leadership departures on the R&D side, but just kind of help us understand how you're adapting to some of the changes and just given CDMS tends to be longer sales cycles, just how customers are thinking about that in the current environment?\nPeter Gassner: It's going very well in the clinical data management area. What I mentioned in my prepared remarks is actually not a new deal there so much as the customer that went live in six months, a top 20 customer that went live in six months on our core EDC product. That's kind of for all these studies, that's kind of unheard of. That's super, super fast. That's the thing that many customers generally would do in 12 months, 18 months, even two years. So I think that's going to generate its own kind of momentum, especially we have our R&D Summit coming up in the fall. That customer will be talking there about what they did. So I'm really pleased with that and the competitive environment is actually quite benign. It's not moving. If you look at the competitive environment, it's not moved since we entered it into it. Now that's just with our core our EDC product, you also call that CDMS, but that's a core electronic data capture. We're also starting to make early progress in our other areas, randomization and trial supply management, that's a big area as well. And then the EPRO patient-reported outcomes, that's a big area as well. And there's never been a company that has been a leader in all of those three categories before. I think we're set out to do that over time. And it's just sort of what Veeva does, make an integrated suite of products that's all great. And the fact is in the clinical data management area, there's none that's ever been a company that's accomplished that. So while I'm very excited about our EDC progress, that's just getting started for clinical data management.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCharles Rhyee: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Peter, I think you guys mentioned Crossix briefly that it kind of contributed to revenue growth. If I recall, this is one that you've called out in the past talking about the environment being tough, maybe causing some slowing growth in the near term. Can you give us an update here? Has the environment improved at all for Crossix maybe give us a little bit more detail there.\nBrent Bowman: Yes, this is Brent. I'll take that question. So overall, we've talked about the macro over the last 90 days hasn't changed, and that's applicable for Crossix as well. It was one of the areas in the back half of last year that had a little bit more of the headwinds of marketing budgets. So it is still in that unchanged state. So it's still a very exciting business for us with a lot -- very, very strategic and meaningful to our customer base. So we're excited about the opportunity, but no change in the macro.\nCharles Rhyee: Okay. And then, Brent, maybe just a follow-up. In the guidance, you're implying a step up in the operating margins call it, 34-ish percent. You had these Summits and kickoffs. Can you give us a little bit more sense for the mix in the OpEx line that we should kind of expect? I'd imagine sales and marketing steps up in the second quarter. Maybe just give us a little sense for the cadence, how we should think about sort of the various OpEx lines?\nBrent Bowman: Yes. It's going to -- I mean it's going to flow through the course of the year because I think about we have field kickoff in one quarter. We'll have a Commercial Summit, and R&D Summit in a different quarter. So I don't think I would try to over model that, think about that as an incremental step up overall for the year, and it's relatively smooth. Q1 was the field kickoff. That would be one example where it's a little bit larger.\nCharles Rhyee: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.\nBrent Bowman: Sure. No problem.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stan Berenshteyn of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nStanislav Berenshteyn: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just revisiting the EDC win you announced, I'm just curious, have they provided any feedback as to why they switched away from their legacy DC provider and can you share with us who their legacy EDC vendor was or is, I should say?\nPeter Gassner: Yes. In terms of -- I wouldn't mention in general, we're always replacing one of the two main incumbents for large systems. That would be Medidata or Oracle, and we've replaced both of those. And the case for change is really around modernization. It's around modernization, better customer relationship. So modernization would be around a better application, better experience for the clinical research site, faster to go to clinical research study, faster to do a change of a clinical research study. And then also the ability that Veeva has a clinical operations suite as well as a clinical data management suite, and we deliver maintain and update and upgrade that integration between those two things. So we completely take that burden on for the customer. So that's what it is. It's not that complicated. More modern, better service and more integrated because we have the clinical operations suite.\nStanislav Berenshteyn: Okay. And then maybe a quick one on Commercial. Can you give us any updates on Crossix? Are you seeing any changes in the growth rates there? And any updates on global pharma sales rep numbers?\nPeter Gassner: In terms of Crossix, I'll take that one and then, Paul, maybe the one sales reps number. Crossix business continues on. It will have its ups and downs quarter-by-quarter because it's related to marketing spend and campaigns, and that can go up and down a little bit. So in that way, it's a little bit more like our Professional Services business. The directions we're taking Crossix is to use it to -- Crossix and our CRM system to integrate them more tightly together going forward. They're integrated now, integrating more tightly, more bidirectionally to help integrate sales and marketing at our customer sites. And that's something they're really excited about. And remember for Crossix, that's the same core data platform that we use to leverage to build as well. So we're committed to Crossix and excited to Crossix and looking forward to converting more of our customers to enterprise license agreements over time, and that will then smooth out some of that up and down in the quarter. And then in terms of the pharmaceutical sales reps, Paul?\nPaul Shawah: Yes, I'll give you an update there. Just in terms of the reductions, the majority of the reductions have already played out through the system. And then most of the remaining reductions that we had talked about for a long time will play out through the remainder of this year. And I expect when it's all said and done, it will end up being slightly less than the 10% that we initially had projected and talked about it. We did see very slight reductions in the quarter, roughly in line with what we had anticipated.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Natalie Hao of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks for taking my question. So earlier, you touched a bit on Veeva Quality. And in the press release, you mentioned that QMS won a top 20 pharma. So the Quality segment seems to have a pretty large opportunity. Can you talk a bit more on what has been driving the strength in that category and expand a bit more on how you're really going to capture the opportunity there? Thank you.\nPeter Gassner: Yes, Quality is a big area for us. So in that Quality suite, we have QualityDocs, which is the quality documentation management, standard operating procedures, things like that. We have the quality management system. Which is Managing Quality, Managing Deviations, things called CAPA. Then we also have training in there. Then we also announced LIMS, our laboratory information system for manufacturing and our validation product, which is computer systems and other validations. And then also, we have what's called Learn GXT, which is our learning content for quality. So it's a very big area, and that's never been available from one vendor before, all on the unified data model and platform. So that's what we have. It's quite unique. We set out to build that. The early plans of doing that were roughly 10 years ago, and it takes a long time to execute on that. We're very excited. What's fueling the momentum there is customer success. First of all, these systems are not things you change out easily or lightly. Long implementations, and you don't do it unless you need to do it. So each customer has their own time frame when their existing systems are running out of gas. I would say they're not investing much these days in their legacy systems because there's broad awareness that Veeva is probably a better alternative. I do get the feeling now for most customers, they think they probably will be going to Veeva for our core established products, training, quality Docs QMS. The question is when. And then there's a lot of wait and see about our new products, validation and LIMS. Hey, is that product going to be real. I don't want to be first. Let's get that gone. So that's how it is. It's a long, long replacement cycle. When we talk about a long runway for growth ahead, those are the types of things, the seeds we've planted in, things like LIMS where we don't even have our first customer. EPro, where we just have a few customers. Compass, we have nobody on patient and prescriber. Our safety suite, we have more to build out in our safety suite. That's why I say long runway of growth, and there's no magic to it, it's driven by customer success.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Peter Gassner for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nPeter Gassner: All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today, and thank you to our customers for your continued partnership and to the Veeva team for really an outstanding work in this quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brent Bowman",
            "content": "Yes. So a couple of things there. On the unbilled AR, I think there was a decline, right? So in that part of what you're seeing there was on the termination for convenience playing through. But on the OCF line, overall, we're really pleased with our strong execution in the quarter. On a full year basis, we've increased the number by $30 million. So we're at $840 million, which is growing about 20%. So I feel really good about the execution and -- for the quarter and for the outlook for the year. Absolutely correct. So from a TFC perspective, just put it in complete context, we know what we expect to happen, happened in Q1 and what we expected to happen for the full year is still intact. So no surprises. Sure, Craig. This is Brent. I'll take that. Yes. So as Peter mentioned earlier, we're not -- we don't have a significant exposure to the emerging biotech. And if you think about it in terms of total revenue, it's about 4%. So kind of you can think about that. And that's comprised of about 1,000 employees with no approved product. So that kind of gives you some context of that part of the business. And then your second question, Craig, I want to make sure I get it right? Yes. So over the last 90 days, we really haven't seen a significant change in the macro. So we -- it continues to be impacted, but we factored that all into the guide, and we're executing well in that area. Yes, it's really early right now. We're focused on ensuring that we have the right product working with our customers. So that's our focus right now. Let's get the product right, and then we'll get into more of the details on kind of the sizing and the opportunity there. But we're excited overall about the opportunity we have in front of us. Yes. So thanks for the question. So looking out at fiscal year '25, we reiterated our guidance. So at least $2.8 billion and at least $1 billion in operating income. And we're expecting that the current macro situation is constant. There's no change. There's no improvement. It doesn't get worse. So that's kind of our assumption as we look out in time. So we're excited about the opportunities. We're early days in a large market opportunity, and that's the best look of the business we have right now. Yes, sure. And so yes, so we're providing normalized billings to try to take some of the noise out of the equation for you. So to anchor on a full year basis, we increased our number by $5 million. So that's growth of about 15%. So real pleased with the execution there. Specifically to Q3, what you've seen in some of our newer business, the underlying renewal base has shifted a bit. So it was shifting away from the first half more to the back half, Q3, Q4. So that's part of why you're seeing an acceleration in the billings growth. Also the price increase CPI will start to come into play in Q3 and Q4 as well. So those are a couple of the contributors and why we are confident in the acceleration in the back half of the year. Yes, happy to, Saket. So first, what are we normalizing? So what we're normalizing is for our remote business, if there's a change in frequency or a co-term. So we have a view entering the year what that's going to look like for the full year. So once we got into Q1, there were a few customers where they had changing billing terms. So basically, those new deals offset what we thought before. So on a full year basis, calculated billings and normalized billings are one and the same. You're going to have differences quarter-to-quarter, but for the full year, it nets out. Yes. So if we kind of maybe just break it down to what happened in Q1. So from a Q1 perspective, we had a nice beat and a portion of that was from more annual billers than we expected. And then part of it was the underlying strength in the business. So we slowed that through. The unbilled AR that you foresee, like that question you asked me had no impact on how we look at the full year normalized billings. So -- but there's not a direct impact there. Sure. Yes, this is Brent. I'll take that question. So overall, we've talked about the macro over the last 90 days hasn't changed, and that's applicable for Crossix as well. It was one of the areas in the back half of last year that had a little bit more of the headwinds of marketing budgets. So it is still in that unchanged state. So it's still a very exciting business for us with a lot -- very, very strategic and meaningful to our customer base. So we're excited about the opportunity, but no change in the macro. Yes. It's going to -- I mean it's going to flow through the course of the year because I think about we have field kickoff in one quarter. We'll have a Commercial Summit, and R&D Summit in a different quarter. So I don't think I would try to over model that, think about that as an incremental step up overall for the year, and it's relatively smooth. Q1 was the field kickoff. That would be one example where it's a little bit larger. Sure. No problem."

            "name": "Peter Gassner",
            "content": "Thank you, Gunnar, and welcome, everyone, to the call. We had a great start to the year, delivering results ahead of guidance with total revenue coming in at $526 million. The macroeconomic environment was stable and it was another quarter of strong execution across R&D and Commercial. In Commercial, development of Vault CRM is on track, and we gave a compelling demo at Summit. We expect to have our first customers live on Vault CRM early next year. We also announced two new Compass data products in our first AI application, CRM Bot for Vault TRM. We also saw continued momentum in Development Cloud across all areas. Our product strategies in R&D and Commercial are clear and compelling, and we have a long runway of growth ahead. At this point, we'll open up the call to your questions. Yes, I'll take that one. This is Peter. In general, the industry operates on pretty long cycles, especially our very established and large customers. So the ups and downs of the macro environment don't really affect them too much. We do see a little bit more effect in what we call our emerging biotech. These are small customers, generally don't have an approved product. So we see -- when funding gets tight, we see a little bit of pressure there. But nothing that really has changed in the last 90 days at a macro level. So I guess that's why we're not so susceptible to those small ups and downs and business just continues to move forward. Yes. That's the right way to think about the full suite of data products for the Commercial area and a streamlined, simplified suite of data products. One thing you could compare it to, it's a different domain, but in our quality area, and that's something we've had for many years now, and we introduced QualityDocs, document management system, regulated content management system. We have QMS, which is a structured data quality management system, and we have training. It all fits together on a unified data model on one common platform. That's what we're doing for Compass. So we have patient now, which is the anonymous patient data, 60 billion rows of patient data in the U.S. about prescriptions, procedures, diagnoses. Now what we're adding in January is Compass Prescriber and Compass Sales, and those are projected data products about prescribers' prescribing patterns, the individual prescribers and also at the Zip and State level and the national level. So they all sit together on one common data model. They're separate products, very separate different purposes. So for the first time in January, we'll have this suite of products. And I think that's what customers will find compelling. And then just like we always do, we have to get a customer to have all three of those products, have to get them live using it, have to get them happy, round off the corners, have to get them talking to other customers. And that's one thing about competition. Usually the best product and the best service will win. And when you look at Compass and how we talk to customers there, our message is pretty simple. It's about better data and better service. And so it's just an execution game. I feel very comfortable about our product strategy. It feels so similar to what we've done in some of our Vault suites before, and now it's just down to executing. Yes. We -- I like our position as it relates to AI because we're a core system of record. So that's something you're always going to need. I think that's one thing that people should always understand. Core system of records will be needed even in the world of AI. If I ask Brent, hey, Brent, do you think 10 years from now, you'll need a financial system to manage your financials. He's going to tell me, yes, I really need one, you can't take it away. ChatGPT won't do it for me, right? I'm making a joke there, but our customers have the same critical operational systems around drug safety, around clinical trials, around regulatory, around their quality processes. So those are always going to be needed. Now we are also building our data assets, and these are proprietary data assets, Link, Compass and we're building more data assets. Those will also be not affected by AI, but AI will be able to leverage those assets and make those assets more valuable. So I think we'll develop more -- we'll do basically three things. We'll develop more applications over time. CRM Bot the first. We got to get that right. We also will -- our proprietary data will get more valuable. And the third thing we'll do is make our applications fit very well when customers have their own proprietary AI applications. So especially the Vault platform, we'll do a lot of work in there to make it fit really well with the other AI applications they have from other vendors or that they develop themselves, because it's an open ecosystem, and that's how that's part of being Veeva. We are this broad platform for the customers, and we're an ecosystem in which they can plug in their own intelligence and their own partnerships. So I'm really excited about how AI is going to play out for Veeva. It's very clear what we need to do. Yes, two things. I think the main thing is we're getting very good at being a multiproduct company. We've been working on that for -- we've been in business for, what, 16 years now. We've been a multiproduct company, really, I guess, since 2012-ish, something like that. So more than 10 years now. We have a lot of products. And we're getting good at it in our operating model, how we manage economy, what roles and responsibilities are. And there's a lot of people in Veeva that know that operating model and know how to fit into it. So 6,000 people at Veeva, so we can do more parallel processing. And we just keep doubling down and getting better at being a true great multiproduct company, which is relatively rare here. And then -- so that's, I would say, the macro level. That's what I mean by our innovation engine. For instance, we have people at Veeva now other than me, who are good at overseeing others, who are doing the innovation. So we have that level of scale, and it's relatively rare. Now also, we have deeper customer relationships than we've ever had, and that just really helps, because you get the benefit of the doubt when you have that customer relationship, you get early customers faster, you get more clear feedback. And I would say, the third thing is also when we make an innovation, we're often making an integration to our existing products. So if you look at, for example, our safety product, it's a very good product on its own. But the promise of having it integrated into our clinical products, that's an advantage that another company doesn't have, if they're just starting up a safety product on their own. So long-winded answer there, but it is an insightful question, something I'm very proud of our innovation engine. It's very rare. Sorry, I didn't catch that question about which announcement. Okay. And that one, I know we do a lot of work with Sanofi. I don't know the specifics of the announcement. Paul, do you -- are you more in... Yes, I can take that one. So if we start with Service Center, that's included in Veeva CRM. It will probably result in more CRM licenses over time, because maybe somebody that was a pure inside sales rep, maybe they didn't use Veeva CRM, some type of thing like that. So it's included in the license, but it may mean more users. CRM Bot will -- that's not an included product so that will have a license that will most likely be licensed by the user. So that will be net new. But as Brent mentioned, we're focused on getting the product right and we don't have pricing for that or sizing for that yet. With Link, which we've had for a while, specifically Link key people, that's it's often somewhat of a new category for customers. This is real-time customer intelligence. So either they did it internally or they had a vendor that was sort of substandard in that area. So it's kind of there, we're kind of creating the market and teaching people, here's the value you can get with a data asset like that. And that then is continuing on as we broaden out the Link suite, the Link for key accounts and then we're bringing out for clinical trials and preclinical research sites. So that's more of an education campaign. For Compass, yes, that's a direct replacement where the major incumbent there is IQVIA. And IQVIA has a set of data products, there are quite a few that they've built up over the -- over time. And there, it's more simple, hey, we have a more modern solution, fewer moving parts. They can probably save some money on that. But that -- I don't think that's the primary reason that would go with us. It'd be a more modern product that works for more complex medicines better data and better delivery, but that one is the replacement. Just like originally, when the company started, there was a SebelCRM that was from Oracle that was a dominant market leader in Pharma CRM. And that was a replacement job, replacement parts. Veeva CRM is better. It's cloud, it's better out with Sebel and with Aviva. This is going to be a similar type of thing out, with the IQVIA for that data and with Aviva. No. Make no mistake, that's hard work, right? We have to execute well to make that happen. I'll take that one. I couldn't comment on specifics of Merck product adoption. I would really say that the partnership is working. We're thrilled with the partnership, I think Merck is getting value from it by a very open relationship with Veeva that's helping to transform their business to be more digital and data driven. We're certainly getting value out of it, because we're learning how to manage a customer with a true, true partnership like that, that starts at the CEO level. So we are rethinking about what's possible. I don't -- it's not shaping our product strategy so much as specifically what we'll do and what products. But I think it is shaping our delivery strategy and how we manage and partnership and partner with customers because it's a whole different selling notion. It's a more -- it's not a selling notion. It's a partnership notion. So I couldn't be more happy with that. To me, it's one of the highlights of our year. Yes. Our - so we haven't seen any real changes in the last 90 days. If you compare with two years ago, for example, funding environment is tighter. It's not as easy for small biotech to get funding at the valuations that they want and project screening is tighter. It's not as easy for large companies to justify spending for the future because they're a little more apprehensive about the curve. So -- but none of that has changed in the last 90 days, and it's been included in our guidance. And you asked specifically how does that project scrutiny play out? Honestly, just extra scrutiny. Let's say they're going to -- it doesn't depend on product area. It could be in the quality area, in the CRM area and the safety and the regulatory area, and there's just extra scrutiny. This project is going to be done, how much is the budget for this project. When is the ROI going to happen for our company and just double check that. Now with that project scrutiny, we do -- our projects generally do pretty well on that. What has not done well is companies that focus on more discretionary spend or more just one-off project type of stuff. That doesn't do well, and you'll see a lot of those companies having more issues. But ours are -- our projects are investment in core capabilities that people need for the long term, and those tend to be a little more thoughtful and go through. I'd say, to put a clear point of that experimentation, there's less experimentation going on now than there was two years ago. And that's due to more scrutiny. Yes, I think we're able to add more value because we're modernizing. So if you look in the clinical data management area, one of the core areas of that are our EDC, electronic data capture. We're able to -- customers are able to build their clinical studies faster. So that means getting that clinical studies going faster, and they're being able to do their amendments to studies without downtime, without data unloads. So that means they can work better with their clinical research side. Those are just a couple of the examples. So it's a better system that helps them with their efficiency. In terms of what they pay for it, I think they probably pay us actually a little bit less usually. I mean it depends, right? Our customers are all over the map with the different competitors. But maybe on the average, they pay us a little bit less, but I think their cost is significantly less because they have to put less people -- manpower on it. So we always want to do that. We want to deliver more value at a lower price. We want to innovate and make things better and more efficient. So we want to share some -- in some of that return, but the customer -- the industry gets some of that return. And then if you look at the clinical data area, one point I want to bring up. We have two top 20 customers now that have our clinical data management and our safety product only two, and only one of them is live with both and just recently live both. Now what we'll do here over the next 12 months is develop a highly efficient integration between those systems. Highly efficient and standardized integration at the business process level. The industry hasn't seen that before, because no companies had both of those systems, clinical data management and a drug safety system. That efficiency, the customers are just going to get and it's going to make the industry just much, much more efficient. So that's what we always want to do. Charge less, deliver more and run a real profitable business. I think it will be a mix. It may be a mix of a particular brand, maybe for our patient product in a large customer, it could be in the top 20. But for a full replacement sort of being IQVIA free, that will come from a small customer, whether they're existing or a brand-new customer, that will come from a company that sort of maybe has one brand, whether just precommercial, that were not quite ready to launch. That will be the pattern, which is very similar to what we see in many of our products, right? Continue for a smaller, more nimble company to just go all in with Veeva. It's going very well in the clinical data management area. What I mentioned in my prepared remarks is actually not a new deal there so much as the customer that went live in six months, a top 20 customer that went live in six months on our core EDC product. That's kind of for all these studies, that's kind of unheard of. That's super, super fast. That's the thing that many customers generally would do in 12 months, 18 months, even two years. So I think that's going to generate its own kind of momentum, especially we have our R&D Summit coming up in the fall. That customer will be talking there about what they did. So I'm really pleased with that and the competitive environment is actually quite benign. It's not moving. If you look at the competitive environment, it's not moved since we entered it into it. Now that's just with our core our EDC product, you also call that CDMS, but that's a core electronic data capture. We're also starting to make early progress in our other areas, randomization and trial supply management, that's a big area as well. And then the EPRO patient-reported outcomes, that's a big area as well. And there's never been a company that has been a leader in all of those three categories before. I think we're set out to do that over time. And it's just sort of what Veeva does, make an integrated suite of products that's all great. And the fact is in the clinical data management area, there's none that's ever been a company that's accomplished that. So while I'm very excited about our EDC progress, that's just getting started for clinical data management. Yes. In terms of -- I wouldn't mention in general, we're always replacing one of the two main incumbents for large systems. That would be Medidata or Oracle, and we've replaced both of those. And the case for change is really around modernization. It's around modernization, better customer relationship. So modernization would be around a better application, better experience for the clinical research site, faster to go to clinical research study, faster to do a change of a clinical research study. And then also the ability that Veeva has a clinical operations suite as well as a clinical data management suite, and we deliver maintain and update and upgrade that integration between those two things. So we completely take that burden on for the customer. So that's what it is. It's not that complicated. More modern, better service and more integrated because we have the clinical operations suite. In terms of Crossix, I'll take that one and then, Paul, maybe the one sales reps number. Crossix business continues on. It will have its ups and downs quarter-by-quarter because it's related to marketing spend and campaigns, and that can go up and down a little bit. So in that way, it's a little bit more like our Professional Services business. The directions we're taking Crossix is to use it to -- Crossix and our CRM system to integrate them more tightly together going forward. They're integrated now, integrating more tightly, more bidirectionally to help integrate sales and marketing at our customer sites. And that's something they're really excited about. And remember for Crossix, that's the same core data platform that we use to leverage to build as well. So we're committed to Crossix and excited to Crossix and looking forward to converting more of our customers to enterprise license agreements over time, and that will then smooth out some of that up and down in the quarter. And then in terms of the pharmaceutical sales reps, Paul? Yes, Quality is a big area for us. So in that Quality suite, we have QualityDocs, which is the quality documentation management, standard operating procedures, things like that. We have the quality management system. Which is Managing Quality, Managing Deviations, things called CAPA. Then we also have training in there. Then we also announced LIMS, our laboratory information system for manufacturing and our validation product, which is computer systems and other validations. And then also, we have what's called Learn GXT, which is our learning content for quality. So it's a very big area, and that's never been available from one vendor before, all on the unified data model and platform. So that's what we have. It's quite unique. We set out to build that. The early plans of doing that were roughly 10 years ago, and it takes a long time to execute on that. We're very excited. What's fueling the momentum there is customer success. First of all, these systems are not things you change out easily or lightly. Long implementations, and you don't do it unless you need to do it. So each customer has their own time frame when their existing systems are running out of gas. I would say they're not investing much these days in their legacy systems because there's broad awareness that Veeva is probably a better alternative. I do get the feeling now for most customers, they think they probably will be going to Veeva for our core established products, training, quality Docs QMS. The question is when. And then there's a lot of wait and see about our new products, validation and LIMS. Hey, is that product going to be real. I don't want to be first. Let's get that gone. So that's how it is. It's a long, long replacement cycle. When we talk about a long runway for growth ahead, those are the types of things, the seeds we've planted in, things like LIMS where we don't even have our first customer. EPro, where we just have a few customers. Compass, we have nobody on patient and prescriber. Our safety suite, we have more to build out in our safety suite. That's why I say long runway of growth, and there's no magic to it, it's driven by customer success. All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today, and thank you to our customers for your continued partnership and to the Veeva team for really an outstanding work in this quarter. Thank you."

            "name": "Paul Shawah",
            "content": "Hi Joe, this is Paul. Thanks for the question. So Summit was great. We had nearly 2,000 people there. It was a great event. It was our first showcase of Vault CRM. We demoed to a broad audience and generated a lot of excitement. I'd say there was a couple of specific things that our customers were excited about. First is the idea that they're going to get the full functionality of everything we've delivered in Veeva CRM over the past 15 years. All of that plays forward into Vault CRM. So what that means for our customers is they never have to go backwards. They -- everything they've invested in they'll get the advantage of. So full functionality was a really big value prop for our customers. I would say number two is the big announcements that we have. Service Center, which is for inside sales reps and hybrid reps. These are people that need access to the core Veeva CRM functionality, but they also need access to things like handling inbound calls and cases. So they're excited that this is all going to be part of one application, but also CRM Bot, which is super exciting. You saw some of Peter's remarks about generative AI, and this is going to be the first application that we're building. It's going to be part of Vault CRM. So that generated a lot of excitement. And then I guess maybe the third thing was the approach we're taking to helping the industry move to Vault CRM. So same application, same data model, helping customers move their data, their configuration. They're excited about how we're going to help them make the transition. So overall, really positive events, a lot of really positive feedback on our direction in Vault CRM. Yes. Brian, thanks for the question. Yes, so the way I would think about it is some companies have adhered pretty close to what Veeva delivers kind of standard in our standard product or have done relatively straightforward configurations and other companies have done more customizations, particularly some of the larger companies. So -- and then there's different ways to make the move to Vault CRM. So one way is to just do in a sense, a technical migration. And then another way is to think about changing process, business process change as they make that transition. So the level of complexity of the move is going to depend on how much customization they've done, but also the approach that they're taking to move over, if they're going to change process or if they're just going to keep things and just do a simple technical migration. So lots of variables going on there. But what we are doing is we're trying to make it as easy as possible for our customers. And we made some really important design decisions to try to make that simple. Keeping the data model the same, keeping the application the same, moving all of their data for them, moving their configuration for customers. So we're automating as much of a move as possible. Now you're right, we did talk about early customers going live potentially as early as our Summit next year. Likely what those will be, will be some net new customers. For example, this quarter, we announced 11 new SMB wins, it would likely be a company like that, that would go live in that first move. And then I would expect migrations to happen starting in 2025. So the first customers who are on Veeva CRM moving over to Vault CRM starting in 2025, with most of those still happening in the 2026 to 2029 frame. Yes, you're right. Those announcements will be specific to the Vault platform. So will be service center that will be part of the Vault CRM application and also the same with CRM all be part of Vault CRM. So there may or may not be additional incentive for customers to move. But I can tell you that based on the feedback that we've heard from Summit customers are excited about both of them are excited about those opportunities. And that was the promise. The promise was they get the full functionality of Veeva CRM. They get a deep market-leading application and they're going to get new innovation over time. Yes, I think you're I think you're probably referring to the Sanofi quality announcement where they've adopted our quality documentation, quality management suite. Is that... So I think what you're seeing there, first of all, we're excited about quality. It's a significant market. We've introduced a lot of new applications and innovation in there. And this is another good example of that unified quality suite, that value proposition playing through. And I think that's what Sanofi saw. They're trying to streamline and modernize their quality processes, and they're standardizing on bot quality to do that. So super exciting, a good example of another large company kind of in a sense going all in to modernize the quality of manufacturing process. We have been -- the way we announced and launched this, we focused in on patient data. So we're focused in on customers that can get started relatively quickly, and they're exploring, they're testing our patient data. Most of them are finding that, to Peter's point earlier, it's actually better data. They're getting a broader view into the market. They're finding more patients, they're finding more doctors. So that's the very specific market segment that we've been focused on. We haven't been focused on trying to sell the full suite, because it hasn't been available yet. So I wouldn't say that companies are holding back, because we're not really focused on that part of the market yet. Now given the fact that we're not that far away from having that full set of products, by January of next year, we'll have everything we need to be a full replacement. It will open up a broader part of the market. Yes, Jack. I can take that. So we still see IQVIA pretty consistently. We also see regional competitors. None of that has changed. We continue to compete with them. We win most of the time. I'm excited about the 11 new wins that we've added in the quarter. So we're continuing to add customers in a pretty tight environment. So I'm excited about our progress, our execution in CRM. With regard you asked about IQVIA, you asked about Salesforce also, I'll give you some commentary on Salesforce. It's been six months since we made that announcement, the partnership, the way we're working together to support joint to support our joint customers is working well. I'm not surprised by that, but I'm pleased that, that's continuing. So we continue to work well together from an operational day-to-day standpoint. I would add the -- maybe the one thing that's changed is Salesforce does have the technically the right to compete with us in the pharma CRM space. We did terminate -- we announced terminating our agreement with them. There's language in the contract, which gives them that right. So I guess, maybe that's a little bit of a difference, but the reality is, I guess, maybe the bigger picture is the space needs pharma CRM. We're the market leader in this space for a reason. We've invested a lot in building a very, very deep industry-specific applications. And I haven't seen any competitor, any company really go down that path. Nobody is there, and nobody is really even close to that. So we continue to focus on customer success, continuing to innovate and really enabling that very deep functionality for the industry. So pleased where the competitive environment is. Most of them were in North America. There were a couple in one or two, I believe, in Europe, but the majority were in North America. And these are -- most of them are also companies commercializing for the first time. There were a couple of competitive displacements that we had. So companies that had existing products like IQVIA, and we replaced them. So it's a bit of a mix, but biased more towards the U.S. market. Yes. I mean for -- it is a topic of conversation, certainly with our larger customers, the global customers, companies in the large enterprise, they're focused on this. This is something that they know they're going to have to do at some point and focus on over the next several years. Remember, customers have through 2030, but for some of these large companies, this is a big deal. They have to make sure that they plan and think about this. So we're working very closely with all of our large customers to help them understand the implications, what it means for them, but also the benefits that they get out of this. So I think there's a lot of -- the last six months was about understanding what does this mean and the rationale. And I think the Summit helped with that, having them see it and understand that it's real and understanding that there's a path forward. And that they're ultimately going to get a new level of innovation for them. Now there's certainly going to be work to do to get there. Our customers will have to -- this will be projects for our customers. It's on us to make sure that we minimize the size of that. And certainly, relative to doing some other alternatives that doesn't really exist in the market today. This will be a whole lot easier. So that's how they're thinking about it. They're helping, the last six months was about digesting and understanding and now appreciating some of the innovation we're going to deliver over time. Yes, I'll give you an update there. Just in terms of the reductions, the majority of the reductions have already played out through the system. And then most of the remaining reductions that we had talked about for a long time will play out through the remainder of this year. And I expect when it's all said and done, it will end up being slightly less than the 10% that we initially had projected and talked about it. We did see very slight reductions in the quarter, roughly in line with what we had anticipated."
