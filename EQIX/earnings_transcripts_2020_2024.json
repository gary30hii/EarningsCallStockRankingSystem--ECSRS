At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles.\nCharles Meyers : Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. I hope that 2021 is off to a great start for all of you and that you and your loved ones are safe, healthy and ready for an exciting year ahead. As I reflect on the extraordinary events of 2020, it's clear we are living in a time unlike any other in our history. Without question, the COVID-19 pandemic changed nearly every aspect of our lives. For some, the impact has been and continues to be devastating. Our hearts and our support continue to go out to those suffering or facing great loss. Despite the rapidly changing landscape, our focus has remained clear. Ensuring the health, safety and well-being of our employees, customers and partners, keeping our data centers safely operating around the world and continuing to be a source of strength for our communities. I'd like to take a moment here to thank our employees for not only enduring but excelling in the face of adversity and for powerfully demonstrating our commitment to be in service to: in service to each other, to our customers, to our shareholders, and to the communities in which we live and operate. In the midst of all that has transpired, our business model has proven resilient, and we continue to innovate, execute and deliver for our customers. We closed over 17, 500 deals in 2020, reflecting the strength of our value proposition and highlighting the tremendous scale and momentum of our go-to-market engine. We expanded our scale and reach, both organically and through M&A, solidifying our position as a leading digital infrastructure provider in Canada, entering the Mexico market and announcing our GPX transaction in India, which we believe will be an ideal springboard in this large and growing market. We completed 16 new expansions, our most active build year ever, and have a sizable construction roadmap still ahead to support our backlog and healthy pipeline. We've introduced transformative capabilities on Equinix Fabric and Network Edge, revolutionizing the way enterprises connect digital infrastructure and we launched Equinix Metal, a fully automated and interconnected Bare Metal as a Service offering that provides even greater flexibility for customers to place their digital infrastructure where they need it, when they need it. We also had a very active year in the capital markets, leveraging our investment-grade ratings to refinance our debt, driving substantial interest savings into the business as reflected in our AFFO per share metric. For the year, we delivered $6 billion in revenue, completing our 72nd consecutive quarterly top-line increase and amazing 18 years of continuous revenue growth. In terms of the road ahead, one post-pandemic reality is already clear: our world is increasingly and inescapably more digital. Digital is reshaping our everyday lives and is impacting every element of our customers' businesses, not just how they interact with their customers, but how they interact with their data, how they collaborate and innovate, how they support their employees, how they engage partners, how they architect their network. Everything is changing. Digital transformation is reshaping the competitive landscape across every sector of the global economy and is fueling demand for a new generation of digital infrastructure. Infrastructure that is more distributed, more cloud connected and more flexible, characteristics that represent the hallmarks of Platform Equinix.  As service providers build out their infrastructure to capture burgeoning digital demand and enterprise customers embrace hybrid and multi-cloud as the architecture of choice, Equinix continues to play a key role as a nexus for advancing their digital transformation journeys. We believe that the overall market for digital infrastructure will continue to expand significantly, creating a massive long-term opportunity for those providers able to adapt to the evolving needs of digital buyers. We believe Equinix is uniquely positioned to capture this expanding addressable market, and we entered 2021 with a clear set of priorities to build on our market leadership, reinforce our competitive advantage and invest in targeted ways to position us for sustained value creation. First, supporting our people and strengthening our extraordinary culture will continue to be at the center of our strategy. People are foundational to how we will navigate the challenges and opportunities ahead. And our goal is to ensure that our culture creates a sense of opportunity and belonging for all our employees, affording us a durable source of competitive advantage. This year, we're expanding our award-winning sustainability ambitions, a priority that has resonated with both employees and customers as diversity, inclusion, social justice and climate change all remain front and center on the global stage.  Equinix is an important component of greening digital infrastructure, and we have seen a significant increase in customer interest in this area. We continue to expand our efforts around renewables coverage, energy efficiency projects, green building certifications as well as our pursuit of science-based targets and innovative techniques to push sustainability forward in all 3 regions. Second, we will focus on simplifying and scaling our business to drive long-term operating leverage and enhance our customer experience. This will include targeted efforts aimed at streamlining and automating, ordering and billing, enabling channel self-service and delivering enhanced digital engagement options for our customers. In parallel, we'll continue to evolve and scale our highly productive go-to-market engine, investing in more quota-bearing headcount and leveraging our growing channel to amplify our reach to prosecute the opportunity in front of us. Third, we'll continue to expand our global reach with an ambitious plan across both retail and xScale in direct response to customer demand.  And fourth, we'll accelerate our digital services business, adding new product capabilities, expanding market availability and augmenting our go-to-market motion, all aimed at accelerating new customer acquisition and positioning us for future growth as we drive attach rate across our expansive customer base. Turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for the full year were $6 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 8% year-over-year and AFFO per share grew 12% year-over-year. Interconnection revenues grew 14% year-over-year, driven by strong adoption of Equinix Fabric and solid interconnection adds. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our longer-term product roadmap and platform vision continue to advance to support our position as the world's digital infrastructure company. We now have over 392,000 interconnections and continue to build out ecosystem density across our metros. In Q4, we added an incremental 7,700 interconnections, more than our top 15 competitors combined, fueled by continued strength in network and cloud connectivity. Internet Exchange saw significant increases, both in port capacity and traffic growth, with peak traffic up 8% quarter-over-quarter and 43% year-over-year, driven by cloud, content and gaming segments. Equinix Fabric also saw strong growth, driven by port additions as well as existing customers upgrading to higher speed connections and increasing their use of our intra-metro offering. We also launched a new capability that allows Equinix Fabric users to quickly and easily connect to any other customer on Platform Equinix, unlocking the full value of our scaled digital ecosystems. And with Equinix Fabric integration built into both Network Edge and Equinix Metal, digital leaders are finding it easier than ever to use Equinix to create and connect their foundational infrastructure. In its first quarter as an Equinix branded product, Equinix Metal demonstrated solid momentum and is now available in 8 global metros, with plans for an additional 10 markets early this year. On the xScale side of our business, we continue to be very pleased with our JV strategy and are making significant progress expanding the reach and scale of that business. As planned, xScale is enabling us to extend our product set, capture hyperscale demand and deepen cloud density, while leveraging our balance sheet with the JV structure. We have an ambitious plan for 2021 and are resourcing xScale to accelerate growth. Plans include incrementing our existing JVS, entering in new markets such as Australia and evaluating new options to broaden our reach and leverage our existing land bank. We currently have 8 xScale builds underway, spanning all 3 regions and are moving forward with the second phase of Tokyo 12, given early success in this market. Now let me cover highlights from the verticals. Our Network vertical, again, achieved record bookings, driven by carriers upgrading core, edge and mobile networks to address shifting traffic patterns resulting from the pandemic as well as continued strength in enterprise resale. Network service providers have proven to be some of our most productive channel partners, which has led to sustained momentum in this vertical. New wins and expansions included Senia Networks, a Danish network provider, connecting to partners in Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Hong Kong and London, as well as a Fortune 500 cable operator, leveraging Equinix to re-architect core infrastructure for cloud access to support video-on-demand caching and delivery. Our Financial Services vertical also had a record quarter, led by multinational financial services firms, with particular strength in the Americas. Expansions included a Global 2000 fintech player, expanding their equity options present to access our dense financial ecosystem and a Fortune 500 insurance company, implementing a hybrid cloud strategy on Platform Equinix. Our Content and Digital Media vertical saw particular strength in video and digital advertising as companies are investing to bring their services directly to consumers. New wins, included one of the largest shopping and e-commerce retail groups, deploying infrastructure to support digital e-commerce activities; and Index Exchange, a top independent global ad tech marketplace expanding compute nodes to manage increasing traffic from customers. Our Cloud and IT vertical delivered solid bookings, increasing density and coverage of software-as-a-service providers and winning new cloud on-ramps in smaller markets, including Dubai and Melbourne. Expansions included Fortinet, a global cybersecurity platform provider, expanding to support scale and user experience; and ServiceNow, deploying infrastructure closer to users in Europe to optimize performance, enhance user experience and support their rapid growth. Our Enterprise vertical had a strong quarter driven by healthcare and retail as telehealth and digital initiatives see continued momentum. Work-from-home and collaboration-related use cases remain active, although less than pre-pandemic levels as enterprises shift their focus back to broader digital transformation initiatives. New enterprise wins included Atrium Health, the largest health system in the Southeastern U.S. deploying digital infrastructure to enable compliant, multi-cloud and business partner interconnection as well as a Fortune 500 manufacturing company deploying digital infrastructure at Equinix to facilitate cloud connection. And our channel program had another great quarter, accounting for 35% of bookings. We saw particular strength with our hyperscale and technology alliance partners, capturing wins across a wide range of industry segments focused on digital transformation efforts as well as pandemic response. New partner wins included a Canadian automobile parts manufacturer, accessing our network and cloud density to interconnect to the connected car and broader automotive ecosystems. We continue to expect channel bookings to be an important pillar of our go-to-market strategy in 2021 and beyond. Now, let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter.\nKeith Taylor : Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. As Charles noted, we're living in unique times, and I hope you and your families are healthy and well. Despite the challenges of 2020, the Equinix team rallied at all levels of the organization and delivered another strong year for our investors, our customers and our employees. We ended the year on a high note with record gross bookings, strong inter and intra-reaching deal flow activity, positive net pricing actions and a healthy sales pipeline as we head into 2021. Also, we ended the year with significant backlog of cabinets booked but not yet installed. And consistent with my prior quarter's comment, we anticipate a meaningful increase in our cabinets billing metric in the first half of 2021. So simply put, we continue to drive value on both the top-line and at a per share level. And our core strategy as the world's digital infrastructure company continues to separate us from our peers. In the year ahead, we're leaning into our product and services initiatives, scaling and automating our business and investing to expand our platform. We're also managing substantial construction activity at a level previously not seen. With 44 major expansion projects currently underway across 30 markets and 20 countries, including 8 xScale builds. Our build efforts are dollar-weighted towards major metros that generate over $100 million in revenues. Both the OpEx and CapEx investments are driving and supporting the continued volume of high-quality interconnection-rich wins across both our direct and indirect channels, resulting in durable long-term value creation for our shareholders. We've also been active in the capital markets, benefiting from our investment-grade ratings that helped drove down our cost of borrow. Over the past 2 years, we raised over $11.5 billion in capital, funding the growth and scale of the business, while lowering our overall blended cost to borrow by approximately 160 basis points, another value driver as reflected in our AFFO per share metrics. Now, let me cover the highlights for the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q4 revenues were $1.564 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year and better than expectations, in part due to strong NRR activity, although offset in part by a one-off accounting adjustment. We enjoyed another quarter of net positive pricing actions, a strong reflection of how our operating model differs from our peers. Q4 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $9 million benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. Looking forward, we expect NRR activity to decrease in Q1, although step up again in Q2. Global Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $711 million or 45% of revenues, up 5% over the same quarter last year, outperforming our expectations due to favorable revenue mix, strong operating performance and lower utility costs. Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, included a $4 million net FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q4 AFFO was $517 million, meaningfully above our expectations on a constant currency basis due to strong operating performance while absorbing seasonally higher recurring CapEx investments, a similar scenario to prior years. Consistent with AFFO, our operating cash flows increased significantly in the quarter, largely due to strong collection activities. Interconnection revenues were greater than 18% of recurring revenues, showing continued strong momentum across each of our regions, both on a dollar basis and as a percent of our recurring revenues. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on slides 5 through 7. APAC and EMEA were our fastest-growing revenue regions on a year-over-year normalized basis, both growing 11%, followed by the Americas region at 4%. The Americas region saw its third consecutive quarter of record gross bookings with firm pricing, a high mix of midsized deals and our highest number of new logos in 2 years. Additionally, the team continued to sell across the global platform, delivering on our second consecutive quarter of record exports to the other 2 regions. Americas interconnection adds remained strong. Cabinets billing trended back to normal levels, and we expect a large step-up in cabinet billing in the first half of 2021. Bell Canada assets had a good start under the Equinix banner and our integration efforts remain on track. Our EMEA region saw solid bookings in the quarter, including our best intra region in 2 years, with firm pricing led by activity in both our Amsterdam and Frankfurt markets. Revenue growth remains strong, although we expect some 2021 moderation as we lap past our successful cross-connect repricing initiative in 2020. Also, we're investing broadly in our growth and emerging markets, or GEMs to meet the anticipated demand in these edge metros. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had its second best gross bookings quarter with a solid mix of small ecosystem-accretive deals in our Singapore and Japan businesses. Utilization rates remain high. We expect to bring new capacity online over the coming quarters in key markets to ease the anticipated capacity constraints. And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. At year-end, our balance sheet is greater than $27 billion, including unrestricted cash of approximately $1.6 billion, a meaningful decrease over the prior quarter due to the close of the Bell Canada asset acquisition and the settlement of debt refinanced in the quarter. Also, we moved our Paris 9 asset into the EMEA JV and closed our Japan JV with GIC in December. As a result, net of our equity investment, the JVs reimbursed us over $300 million in the quarter. At year-end, our xScale joint ventures had total assets on their balance sheet of greater than $1 billion, including the capital deployed. In 2021, you should continue to expect a meaningful increase in xScale activity. Our net debt levels remain low relative to our peers at 3.8 times, our Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA within our targeted range. Over the past 2 years, we refinanced a large portion of our historically high-yield debt structure. Yet, we still have another $1.8 billion of debt to refinance over the coming quarters, which at current rates would result in another $50 million plus of annualized interest savings. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $834 million, including a recurring CapEx of $74 million, a meaningful increase over the prior quarter, but as expected. Our construction and procurement teams continue to actively manage our expansion pipeline, delivering capacity at robust build levels, while incorporating the health, safety and well-being of our internal and external teams. Over the past year, we've experienced an average construction delay of a few weeks due to the pandemic, a trend that we will continue to monitor and assess. In Q4, we opened 4 new expansion projects, D.C., Frankfurt, Paris and S\u00e3o Paulo. Additionally, we added 7 projects to our expansion tracking sheet, including our entr\u00e9e into Genoa Italy in support of the subsea cable landing station opportunity. Genoa 1 will have a direct fiber access to Milan 5, our new flagship facility in this metro ready to open in Q1. We continue to expand our ownership, acquiring land for development in Genoa, Madrid, Mexico City, Milan and S\u00e3o Paulo. Revenues from owned assets currently represent about 55%. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our 147 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 84% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested, a step down over the prior quarter due to the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar on our non-U.S. stabilized assets. As a reminder, similar to prior years, we plan to update our stabilized asset summary on the Q1 earnings call. Now please refer to slides 11 through 15 for our summary of 2021 guidance and bridges. Do note, our 2021 guidance does not include any financial results related to the pending GPX India acquisition.  Starting with revenues for 2021, we expect top-line growth of 10% to 11%, reflecting the continued momentum in the business and favorable FX rates relative to the prior year. On a normalized basis, revenues are expected to grow 7% to 8% over the prior year. MRR churn is expected to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter for the year. For Q1, we expect the MRR churn to be at the lower end of this range. We expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 47%, excluding integration costs, the result of operating leverage in the business, offset by investments in our product, xScale and business simplification initiatives. We expect to incur $30 million of integration costs in 2021 for various acquisitions. 2021 AFFO was expected to grow 10% to 12% compared to the previous year. AFFO per share is expected to grow 8% to 10%, including integration costs. We've excluded any capital market activities here. 2021 CapEx is expected to be $2. 5 billion to $2.8 billion, including approximately $180 million of recurring CapEx spend, which represents about 3% of our revenues. This guidance also includes approximately $250 million of on-balance sheet spend related to xScale projects, which we expect to be reimbursed for in the future as we move or sell assets into either our current or our future JVs.  And finally, we expect our 2021 cash dividends to increase to slightly greater than $1 billion, a 10% increase over the prior year or an 8% increase on a per share basis. So let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles.\nCharles Meyers : Thanks, Keith. In closing, as 2020 showed us, our world is a very dynamic place. I'm proud of how we have navigated and adapted through this challenging environment, and I'm pleased with our increasing momentum in unlocking the tremendous opportunity ahead. We had a strong finish to the year, delivering across each of our areas of strategic focus, all while maintaining a disciplined and long-term oriented approach to our capital allocation and shareholder return strategies. Undoubtedly, as with all times of transition and transformation, there will continue to be challenges ahead. But I am as optimistic as ever about our business and the opportunity to serve our customers, partners and shareholders as the world's digital infrastructure company. We need to continue to invest in extending our market leadership and ensuring our long-term relevance to the expansive opportunity presented by digital transformation. As a society and as a company, we learned a lot in 2020. And I believe there are a plethora of silver linings that will come from this past year. We enter 2021 filled with gratitude, ready to tackle the challenges and opportunities ahead and collectively energized by the pursuit of our purpose: to be a platform where the world comes together, enabling the innovations that enrich our work, life and planet.  So let me stop there and open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Rollins with Citi.\nMichael Rollins : I was curious if you could talk a bit more about the revenue growth guidance, organic constant currency of 7% to 8% for 2021. What's driving the difference between 2020 and '21? And with the investments that you're making this year, how do you look at the opportunity to grow in the future? Can you accelerate that? Would you expect to maintain that level? Just some additional color would be great.\nCharles Meyers : Yes, why don't I -- I'll start, Mike, and then Keith, you can comment as you see fit. I think that we're seeing, as we've talked about in the past, it's getting harder and harder to grow on a very -- a much larger base, and I think -- and doing that while maintaining a level of discipline on the strategy. And so that's definitely our focus. We believe that that's the way to continue to drive value creation. We're seeing strong uptake in terms of customers being resonant with the value proposition, but it does take a lot of productivity to drive the bookings that are going to fuel the kind of growth rates that we're seeing at given the size of the business overall. I think in terms of the investments, yes, we do believe that those are going to continue to translate to us sustaining and hopefully maybe increasing growth rates over time. But I think -- and I think we've already seen that. I think without the investments that we've made in the past, into our product teams, in particular, and into other areas of business like xScale, I think -- I don't think we would have seen growth that we saw in 2020. And so I think it has been an opportunity for us to invest in the business and generate returns. I think one factor on operating margins, I think, in 2020, going into 2021, 2020 was an unusual year. And I think it was a difficult time for our world overall. I think we made a decision to both continue to invest in our people in various ways that we've given you visibility to in our last several calls. And give them confidence that they have their jobs. And I stand by that decision is the right one for the company, and I'm confident that the long-term return on that decision is compelling. But it's -- interestingly, I think as we -- I guess, partially expected employee turnover fell significantly. Because I think as people sought the security of a really strong employer like Equinix, and they probably fell even more than we anticipated. And it really, to some degree, reduces your range of motion as a business.  So I think when it falls and yet you're wanting to continue to evolve and adapt your workforce to the changing needs of business and the strategy at hand, you're left with the decision as to whether you add and kind of overrun where you thought you were going to be from a headcount standpoint or whether you delay doing that in an effort to sort of stay tighter on the expense side. Like many, we probably ended somewhere in between. And -- but undoubtedly, I think that's a contributing factor in terms of growth of SG&A as a percentage of revenue. And reversing that trend is a priority for us in 2021 and beyond. But we do feel like we needed to make these investments, need to continue these investments in the business because I think the opportunity associated with the digital transformation sort of needs of our customers are significant, and I think we're uniquely positioned to play into those. Keith, anything you want to add, buddy?\nKeith Taylor : Yes, why don't I just maybe add just a couple of other comments? I think the other thing that's very telling about '21 over '20, and particularly as you look into Q1, there's a meaningful step down in our non-recurring revenue. And as we've said before, it tends to be lumpy. We said there'd be a step-up in Q2. That ties in nicely to the incremental cabinet additions that we should -- we expect as a business. And so that's sort of playing into. The other thing that we can't lose sight of is the level of price increases that went through last year. And as I said in my prepared remarks, that we're going to lap over that. And so you get -- you don't get the same benefit, but you get it in your run rate. And then the last thing I would just say is that we continue to invest in xScale, and I talked about a lot of activity taking place there. But we're not yet banking on that as it relates to how the year will progress, either in fees or contribution from our equity interest in the JV. And so that's sort of what's going on with the business.  And again, when you look at overall, 10% to 11%, recognizing normalized is 7% to 8%. I'll tell you, maybe just one other thing that really comes to note here. Again, the Americas region grew about 4%, as I said last quarter in my prepared remarks. As you come through Q1, you'll continue to see relatively modest growth in the Americas, but then you'll see the acceleration through the last 3 quarters of the year. And that's what was really exciting about what we see in the plan. So part of it is just timing based, part of it is the impact of non-recurring revenue, part of it is the price increases. But overall, we feel very confident in the numbers that we put forth here.\nOperator: Our next question is from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.\nRichard Choe : This is Richard for Phil. Just wanted to follow-up on that a little bit, about the Americas growth. I assume some of that is the growth of the acquisitions of Mexico, Packet and Bell what kind of growth rates are you expecting from them versus kind of the average for the overall region?\nCharles Meyers : Keith, you want to grab that? The one thing I would say on Packet is we don't really think about that as a regionally-oriented investment, it's -- since the capabilities are going to be deployed on a global basis. We definitely expect that to grow, seen a substantially over-index over the rest of the business, but we expect to see success across the regions on that. And then the other businesses also, I think, are likely to over-index, but I think there's other factors. I think it's more a sustained -- the sustained performance having really moved through, I think a lot of the churn that we're seeing associated with the Verizon assets and some of the churn that occurred through there and I think a stabilization business and are really -- several really productive bookings quarters from the Americas bookings into.\nRichard Choe : And to follow-up on that, the churn, I guess, was a little higher in the second half of the year, the 2.6%, but you said it would be lower in the first quarter. Is it mainly because of the rise in churn as well? Or is there something else there that is showing that improvement or driving that improvement?\nCharles Meyers : No. It's -- we did say that, in fact, we had -- in the last call, we had said that this quarter, we expect it to be back in range. And we saw a little bit of timing, adverse timing again this quarter and a little bit of unforecasted churn that pushed us up to 2.6%. So I'm a tad reluctant to tell you we're back in range in Q1, but I do believe that's our firm expectation. So we -- I would say that there -- if you look at it, there were several churns over the last couple of quarters that were from acquired assets that were the types of deployments that we wouldn't generally be targeting. And so I don't think it's a fundamental sort of issue in the business as it is, I think, some of the things that weren't -- aren't really part of our strategy moving through. The other thesis that's similar to that is about 20 bps of the Q4 churn was associated with large, lower margin managed services deal in Europe. And so again, I think when you back those things out, you're really looking at sort of a level of churn performance within the business that's pretty consistent with our expectations. Churn is definitely a focus for us in the year ahead. And I do think kind of where we land on a full year on a revenue basis is going to really depend on where we can land in the churn range that we\u2019ve forecasted through the course of the year. So it's going to be a critical area of focus for us. But nothing fundamental that we're seeing, just volatility in terms of -- or just movement in terms of people evolving their architectures and the normal frictional churn that exists in our business. But I think nothing beyond that.\nOperator: The next question is from Tim Long with Barclays.\nTimothy Long : I wanted to ask on the interconnect business. Maybe a two-parter. Can you just update us on the initiatives for global pricing there for the international markets, getting them more up to Americas type of levels? And can you talk a little bit about your view of that, kind of as we head into 2021, particularly with the really strong cabinet equivalent billing in the first half? Could that be a positive indicator for what we'll see from interconnect activity as we head into the first part of the year?\nCharles Meyers : Sure. Yes. I mean, I would say that overall, we're incredibly pleased with the performance of our interconnection business and what that means for the broader performance of the business because interconnection isn't really -- even though we reported as a product line, if you will, and talk about the performance in its growth, and it continues to over-index meaningful versus the rest of the business, it's really a core part of the value proposition and fuels the rest of the business in terms of the strength of the value proposition when it comes to digital transformation. You mentioned specifically pricing, obviously, we had tremendous success implementing a pricing sort of normalization effort in Europe over the course of 2020. We're largely through that now. And so as Keith said, that's impacting the year-over-year compare on revenue growth in Europe, but we're now seeing those benefits sort of built into our run rate. In terms of broader opportunity for pricing adjustments, I think that we're continuing -- we'll continue to evaluate that. I don't -- I wouldn't see anything meaningful on the horizon for us there. I think we, obviously, are just coming off the European adjustments. But I think that we do have to continue to look at both our underlying costs and the trajectory of those and whether or not adjustments are needed for us to continue to maintain our margin profile. And then also, the real focus for us is looking at the value delivered to our customers. And we do think it is so substantial as they look at implementing Equinix Fabric, for example, as a foundational part of their hybrid multi-cloud architectures that we feel comfortable that we're going to be able to continue to get strong pricing from the interconnection offerings. And then last point, Keith did mention we're expecting sort of strong cabinet adds because of the strong backlog. And yes, that's going to -- it is going to continue to fuel interconnection because we're seeing really good sort of ratios in terms of -- because we're maintaining a level of discipline in the strategy, and we're not reliant on these super large footprint deals that are poorly interconnected, we are seeing cabinets fuel interconnection growth. And so overall, I think those things will move nicely in tandem.\nOperator: The next question is from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets.\nAryeh Klein : Charles, you mentioned in the prepared remarks some of the bigger picture changes as the world digitizes. Can you talk about how this is impacting deal flow, deal sizes? Any impact on sales cycles? Are they lengthening in any way as a result?\nCharles Meyers : Yes. Sure. Yes, I mean, I talked about that we're really seeing digital take off and be a Board-level priority for people, and it's changing the way, as I said, people think about not only electronic commerce and digital interaction with their customers, but how they think about data and how they're using AI to create competitive advantage, how they're architecting their networks. And those last 2 examples are 2 really good ones of that are central to what we have in our funnel today and what's fueling our strong bookings on a quarter-over-quarter level. And that is that people thinking about using Equinix as a nexus for their data, locating their data there, intersecting it with cloud services across the globe to create insights and egress those insights to the people within the business that need them. And then network re-architecture has been bread and butter for us for a very long time in Equinix Fabric and then things like Network Edge and now Metal even adding to the mix there, really substantially improving the way people can -- and accelerate in the way people are thinking about network re-architecture. And in terms of how it's affecting our -- I would just say this. I think that if you look at our mix of business, if you look at the kind of volumes that we're doing, 17,500 transactions over the course of the year, it is, we're really focused on those sort of -- on those sweet spots in our business where we can demonstrate differentiated value. And I think that's why we're seeing such strong pricing. We continue to see positive pricing actions and firm even spot pricing, in many ways, in our business because I think the value proposition is so strong.  And so -- and I -- but I do think it's still at a point where these are not really short sales cycles. There's a lot of solution selling still being done with us and through -- and in combination with our partners. And it's why we need to continue to invest in re-architecting and refining and adding capabilities to our selling organization, including scaling our channel. And so those are areas of investment we're making. And I do think that the prospect is, over time, that those -- I would say that I don't think sales cycles are lengthening. And in fact, if anything, I think they're starting to shorten, in particular, follow-on sales cycles, meaning after you've already brought a customer in, that first win with the customer is still -- it can be pretty extended. But follow-on sales cycles, I think, are shortening. And I think that hopefully, that points to us continuing to add even further productivity from the selling engine going forward.\nAryeh Klein : And then just real quick on xScale. You're building in Brazil, you mentioned Australia being in the roadmap. Where does the U.S. stand on that list?\nCharles Meyers : Yes, we talked about that in the past and generally said that it's not a big priority for us. We think that the competitive intensity of sort of the hyperscale business in the U.S. is significant. I would say capacity -- supply and demand are coming more into line in the U.S. markets, whereas I think they were a little out of balance for a while. So I think that's a good improvement overall for the industry. I would say we're -- never say never in terms of whether -- if a customer really had a specific need that they wanted us to be working with on, we'd be receptive to it potentially. But I would say that we're so comfortable and confident in our -- in the durability of our interconnection value proposition in the U.S. and in the strength of our ecosystems, both network, cloud and others, that I think the strategic imperative is a little bit different. And so it wouldn't be a key priority, but I do think we'll be open-minded about opportunities as they might surface.\nOperator: The next question is from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse.\nSami Badri : One for you, Charles, is you commented about an enterprise acceleration really starting to kind of come into fruition, at least in 2021, do you still really believe this to be kind of the case or the observation for the year? Or has your view slightly tilted mainly kind of tied to some of the sales cycle commentary you just gave? Just want to get your latest thinking on any kind of enterprise acceleration mainly taking place in 2021.\nCharles Meyers : Yes. I mean I do think that we're seeing -- in fact, if you look over a multiyear period, I think you've seen a pretty substantial acceleration of the enterprise component of our business. And I think that is really tapping into the traditional service provider density that we -- and ecosystem density that we have as well as our geographic reach and how that plays into hybrid and multi-cloud and distributed architecture as an end state for enterprise customers. And so it's interesting because if you are -- the way we report externally, it has network service. We talk about our Network segment, our Financial Services segment and then Enterprise. In reality, all of those 3 segments have significant enterprise components because our enterprise resale and the network vertical is reported there in terms of how we look at that, but we have a meaning piece of that -- meaningful piece, which is Enterprise business that's sold through a network service provider partner. And then on the Financial Services side, yes, we have our trading ecosystem, but actually, the larger piece of that is Enterprise Financial Services business. And obviously, Enterprise I mean, financial services is one of the markets with a very large IT spend and a very, I think, thoughtful and aggressive agenda about moving to hybrid and multi-cloud as their long-term architecture. So all that has created this enterprise momentum for our business over the last several years and I think that absolutely continues into 2021. And like I said, I think that our selling engine is quite productive. It's not yet -- I don't think we're -- we haven't crossed the chasm by any means, but I actually think that's a -- it's really a good thing when you look at the overall Equinix thesis because I think you're looking at a very large addressable market, and we're still in the early innings of tapping that market. And so that means that solution selling takes a little bit longer to get people over the hurdle and really get them through thinking about their hybrid and multi-cloud end state and how we play in that. But as you -- I think as you get them over the hurdle, there's just a lot more wallet share to be gained. And so I think there is an acceleration opportunity for us. And I would expect enterprise to over-index as a segment for us in 2021.\nSami Badri : Got it. And then just one quick follow-up on adjusted EBITDA margins. On one side, pulling this up, you have interconnection, xScale should have slightly higher margins. And now you have to 35% of sales coming in from the channel. And then you did comment earlier about some of the big investments you are making into your teams, your human capital and your channel. And I guess the perception a little bit is that your adjusted EBITDA margin should level up a little bit higher than what you're guiding to in 2021. Could you maybe just give us a little bit more of an idea, maybe a multiyear view in terms of how you see kind of the trajectory playing out, just we can visualize where Equinix is going to shake out in the next couple of years?\nCharles Meyers : Sure. Keith, you want to start maybe with a view of kind of what the moving parts are on the guide? And then your thoughts on that and I'll add color as needed?\nKeith Taylor : Yes, sure. Sure. Partly, we have to start off with last quarter, one of the things we spoke of last quarter was, there are a number of one-off items that were going through the quarter. And so then you look at the guide that we offered in Q1 and then for the year. I think it's important, one of the things we said is we'll see a recovery of that. There's some one-off costs that were in Q3. They were benefiting us or one-off benefits, I should say. There's one-off costs in Q4. But when you look into Q1, you get to see an EBITDA performance that is substantially up relative to what you would have previously maybe anticipated. Q1 tends to be one of our lower EBITDA quarters. But you can see that we're stepping it up unadjusted $19 million to $39 million. So it gives you a sense of meaningful step-up in the quarter, and that includes absorbing $10 million -- net $10 million that I would refer to as seasonal costs. And then as you look through the tail end or through the next 3 quarters, typically, you'd see -- typically what you'd see in how we're modeling it is, our EBITDA margins would continue to increase throughout the year. And then you sort of take that thinking on a lot of what Charles has said, and then you sort of translate that into our AFFO. Again, one of the things we said, if you look at it in total, AFFO is growing nicely. When you look at it at the share level, it's growing 8% to 10%. So the fact of the matter is, if you back out integration costs, which are, again, they're specific to -- generally to the acquisition of Bell Canada, you're going to see our AFFO per share grow about 10% to 12% this coming year. So there's a lot of value coming into the business. There's a lot of value coming from xScale. But there's still the potential of much more to come if we execute against our strategy. And as I said in at least in my prepared remarks, there is a tremendous amount of activity that we will be embarking upon through this year with xScale. And we're optimistic that, that will continue to drive more value to not only the margin line, but also to our core metric, which is AFFO per share.\nCharles Meyers : And I guess the additional color I might add, Sami, is just -- I do think that we -- we're generating operating leverage. And as I've said in past years -- last year, I guess, that we just are more than offsetting that operating leverage by investments in this case and this year into the product team and into xScale as well as into our, what we call Project Horizon, which is an effort to really simplify and automate elements of the business, and I referred to some of those in my prepared remarks, and I think those are areas that we do need to bend the cost curve in the business. And I think that expanded operating margins are and -- are still a priority for us going forward. And again, I think we -- rather than try to squeeze it too tight and not make enough room to open up the longer-term opportunity, we made a decision to make those investments this year, and we think that's the right one. Over -- but I think we also need to make sure that we're seeing those investments translate into operating leverage over time. So we continue to believe that we can, over a multiyear basis, expand operating margins and see additional leverage.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Market.\nJordan Sadler : So I just wanted to touch base on the Americas cabs billing during the quarter. It was -- it rebounded, but yet still seems a little bit below historical levels even after last quarter's churn event. You pointed to in your prepared remarks a large step-up coming in cabs billing, I think, in the Americas in the first half. Can you point to the drivers there? And did the fourth quarter come all the way around relative to what your expectations were?\nCharles Meyers : Keith why don't you grab that and I'll come back.\nKeith Taylor : Sure. So again, a lot like what Charles said on in his prior remarks, there was still a little higher churn than we originally anticipated in the fourth quarter. Part of it was in Europe, in reference to a managed services provider, but there was some in the U.S. We're at a point now where we believe that we've made the turn. And then as I said, first quarter, you're going to feel in the guide that we give you, goes a little bit soft, but predominantly soft in the sense that I would expect more of -- we're taking about $20 million out of the non-recurring line in the first quarter. And so what you're really seeing is the momentum pick up from the installed cabs -- pardon me, the backlog to be installed cabinets in Q1 and then in Q2. And so there are deals that we've signed, effectively, they're booked, just not installed. And so we are going to see that momentum. And that's why we have the confidence not only in where we think the revenues will go but also the momentum that we will see through the rest of the year.\nCharles Meyers : Yes. Just the only other thing I might add is that we continue to also be very focused on delivering not only cabs, but delivering the yield that we're going to get from those cabs. And that's really a matter of continuing to be disciplined on the workloads and the opportunities that we're pursuing. And I think we're seeing good success there in terms of preserving very high sort of yields per cab. And I think over time, our product portfolio is going to allow us to continue to expand yield effectively as well or at least sustain at the very high levels that we have today. That, combined with the backlog sort of translation, I think, are good signs for the Americas business.\nQ - Jordan Sadler : Along those lines, Charles, can you speak to what you're seeing in terms of pricing in the colo business, particularly U.S. colo business? I know MRR has sort of held up and been a driver, but there's a lot going into that item. But it seems that given the overall dynamic that there might be greater pressure out there on colo. And I'm just curious for your comments.\nCharles Meyers : Yes. If you're talking about, I think, the broader U.S. colo market beyond our U. S. and Americas colo market, I do think there is -- the dynamics may create pressure on that market and which is why I think we need to continue to distinguish ourselves and focus our -- be very disciplined about our targeting and how we're prosecuting the business. I think there's always a continuum in terms of the strength of the value proposition and therefore, how differentiated you can be on pricing. But again, I would point to the fact that we, across our regions are quarter-over-quarter demonstrating positive -- net positive pricing actions, meaning that when we do have a reprice, for example, those are generally being offset by our ability to sustain pricing increases in our contracts, which I think is a really good sign for the business in terms of our ability to do that. So I think undifferentiated colo is going to continue to struggle to maintain price points. And people are either -- are looking for either lowering price and/or looking for new ways or new markets, a lot of them tilting towards hyperscale, which they're certainly not going to find a lot of relief on pricing there. And so I do think the broader market has a translation or a challenge there. But I think we've -- we're not immune from that, but I think we're substantially more insulated, and I think our metrics really demonstrate that.\nOperator: The next question is from Colby Synesael with Cowen.\nColby Synesael : Two modeling questions, if I may. You raised almost $2 billion in equity in 2020. I'm just curious what your thoughts are around the need for equity as it relates to your balance sheet and leverage in 2021? And I guess, offsetting that would be the opportunity to refinance and you noted about $50 million in potential annualized savings. Is the goal ultimately to maintain 8% to 10% AFFO per share growth, one way or the other? And then secondly, just real quickly, what are the assumptions for stabilized growth in 2021? We saw a step down to, I think, 3% in the fourth quarter. \nCharles Meyers : Do you want to start on that, bud?\nKeith Taylor : Sure. So specifically, as it relates to our capital market activity, again, we're very specific about we didn't want to include anything in the guidance. So again, if you take out integration cost, AFFO per share will grow 10% to 12%. So we feel really good about where we are. And as you will -- I think many of you will recall, based on the June 2018 Analyst Day, we thought anywhere from 8% to 12% was a reasonable growth rate for AFFO, and we're tracking well against those models that we developed back in 2018. That all said, when you look at what we plan to do this year, we have a very large capital build. The thing I think of the most is how do we go to our lowest cost of capital, which is basically incremental debt. And so what you're going to see is we're going to refinance out of the debt as appropriate. We'll pick our timing accordingly. We'll get over some period of time the annualized benefit of $50 million plus. And then to the extent that we can or we have capacity, we theoretically could raise a little bit more debt because, again, that would be our cheapest source of capital.  As you're also aware, we do have our ATM program. Last year, we announced a $1.5 billion program, but we'll use that appropriate. As market conditions allow, we would walk through the door. To the extent they don't, then we would preserve that capital for a later date. But again, we're always going to bring a little bit of balance to our capital structure. We're going to make sure that we have liquidity on our balance sheet. We have the cash right now, as we announced in our prepared remarks, $1.6 billion plus $2 billion of incremental liquidity from our line. And I'm just -- I remain very optimistic about the amount of cash that we generate in the business as well as the return of capital from the JV as we continue to invest in building out some of these assets, we'll get some more incremental capital from our JV partners as we scale the business. So again, Colby, I think it's a great question. 8% to 10% is sort of a very comfortable range and where we feel we can deliver in \u201820 -- in through 2021. And we'll update you further on -- I think we're going to do the June analyst -- at the June Analyst Day, we'll update you a little bit further on our longer-term view of what we think we can accomplish as a company.\nCharles Meyers : And then, Colby, on the stabilized assets, we've been saying 3% to 5% on that, and we're kind of right in the middle of that range. And so I think that's probably -- we expect to sort of continue to operate in that range.\nOperator: The next question is from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.\nJonathan Atkin : I had a question on product. I suppose it relates a little bit to Charles, your commentary on kind of yield per cabinet. But can you talk about Equinix Fabric, Equinix Metal, how you're either expanding those product capabilities or expanding the distribution reach? Anything to kind of call out on that front? And then it's been a number of years I think since you've commented on the Federal vertical, but I wondered in the context of some of the Americas questions earlier on the call, what's happening, anything different to call out in that segment?\nCharles Meyers : Sure. Thanks, Jonathan. Yes, we continue to invest in Equinix Fabric and the feature set thereof. I talked a little bit about the recent capability we developed, which allows customers to more easily interconnect to any other Equinix customer on the Fabric. Metal, obviously, has been a significant area of investment, and we're excited to expand the capabilities there in terms of -- or expand the reach of that out now to 18 markets will get to early in '21. We're also investing in the go-to-market motion to continue to adapt that. We're currently executing with an overlay and continuing to refine our thinking on how best to scale that market, but accelerating our overall digital services portfolio, which would include Fabric and Metal and Network Edge and others is a clear priority for us in the year ahead, as I said in our prepared remarks. So we're really excited we believe because you did put that in the context of -- we think that, that can continue to drive yields. We think return on invested capital for those offerings is going to be very attractive over time. And we think, importantly, they're really responsive to the needs of our customers as they think about how digital transformation -- what their digital transformation journey looks like. So you'll hear a lot more from us on what the multiyear view is for those products as we move towards Analyst Day. And then Fed, look, we actually -- we're bullish. We think that there's more opportunity we -- and I think it's something that we're putting a little bit of energy behind. And I can't speak in significant depth on. I know Karl is excited about the opportunities that exist there, and it's something that we're going to continue to be active in trying to pursue the right kinds of opportunities that fit the Equinix value prop.\nOperator: And our last question will come from David Guarino with Green Street.\nDavid Guarino : I just wanted to go back to the sequential step down in colocation revenue in the EMA region. Was that entirely due to this one managed service customer? And are there any more tenants like that inside of your global portfolio?\nCharles Meyers : Keith, do you want to take that?\nKeith Taylor : Yes, I'll take that. David, and in fact, that was referred to the one-off -- I'm referring to the one-off adjustment in my prepared remarks. So basically, it was an accounting adjustment that we made in the fourth quarter that saw the step down in colocation revenues between the 2 quarters. So we saw a step-up in Q3 and then a step down in Q4.\nDavid Guarino : Okay. Got it. And then on the xScale...\nKeith Taylor : Managed -- pardon me, managed service providers go through our MIS line. Just so you know.\nDavid Guarino : Okay. Helpful. And then the last one, just really quick. On your xScale projects for '21, could you just remind us of what the day 1 stabilized yield on those projects are? And it'd be helpful not just to get Equinix's JV share with all the fees, but just on the project level, what kind of returns you expect to achieve?\nCharles Meyers : Yes. I mean, we had talked about -- at Analyst Day, we talked about yields or cash-on-cash yields in the low double-digits -- low to mid-double digits. I've said on a couple of occasions that I think there's been more pressure on those returns and on cash-on-cash yields in the hyperscale space just because of overall supply demand dynamics and a lot of people sort of shooting at that target. And so I think you're looking more at the lower end of that. And I think still seeing either very high single-digit or low double-digit cash-on-cash yields. But I think when you look at it from our standpoint and with both fee structure that exists there and then leverage that exists, I think you're able to get substantially more attractive project returns that are going to be into that double-digit range.\nKatrina Rymill : That concludes our Q4 call. Thanks, everyone, for joining.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Keith Taylor",
            "content": "Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. As Charles noted, we're living in unique times, and I hope you and your families are healthy and well. Despite the challenges of 2020, the Equinix team rallied at all levels of the organization and delivered another strong year for our investors, our customers and our employees. We ended the year on a high note with record gross bookings, strong inter and intra-reaching deal flow activity, positive net pricing actions and a healthy sales pipeline as we head into 2021. Also, we ended the year with significant backlog of cabinets booked but not yet installed. And consistent with my prior quarter's comment, we anticipate a meaningful increase in our cabinets billing metric in the first half of 2021. So simply put, we continue to drive value on both the top-line and at a per share level. And our core strategy as the world's digital infrastructure company continues to separate us from our peers. In the year ahead, we're leaning into our product and services initiatives, scaling and automating our business and investing to expand our platform. We're also managing substantial construction activity at a level previously not seen. With 44 major expansion projects currently underway across 30 markets and 20 countries, including 8 xScale builds. Our build efforts are dollar-weighted towards major metros that generate over $100 million in revenues. Both the OpEx and CapEx investments are driving and supporting the continued volume of high-quality interconnection-rich wins across both our direct and indirect channels, resulting in durable long-term value creation for our shareholders. We've also been active in the capital markets, benefiting from our investment-grade ratings that helped drove down our cost of borrow. Over the past 2 years, we raised over $11.5 billion in capital, funding the growth and scale of the business, while lowering our overall blended cost to borrow by approximately 160 basis points, another value driver as reflected in our AFFO per share metrics. Now, let me cover the highlights for the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q4 revenues were $1.564 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year and better than expectations, in part due to strong NRR activity, although offset in part by a one-off accounting adjustment. We enjoyed another quarter of net positive pricing actions, a strong reflection of how our operating model differs from our peers. Q4 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $9 million benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. Looking forward, we expect NRR activity to decrease in Q1, although step up again in Q2. Global Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $711 million or 45% of revenues, up 5% over the same quarter last year, outperforming our expectations due to favorable revenue mix, strong operating performance and lower utility costs. Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, included a $4 million net FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q4 AFFO was $517 million, meaningfully above our expectations on a constant currency basis due to strong operating performance while absorbing seasonally higher recurring CapEx investments, a similar scenario to prior years. Consistent with AFFO, our operating cash flows increased significantly in the quarter, largely due to strong collection activities. Interconnection revenues were greater than 18% of recurring revenues, showing continued strong momentum across each of our regions, both on a dollar basis and as a percent of our recurring revenues. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on slides 5 through 7. APAC and EMEA were our fastest-growing revenue regions on a year-over-year normalized basis, both growing 11%, followed by the Americas region at 4%. The Americas region saw its third consecutive quarter of record gross bookings with firm pricing, a high mix of midsized deals and our highest number of new logos in 2 years. Additionally, the team continued to sell across the global platform, delivering on our second consecutive quarter of record exports to the other 2 regions. Americas interconnection adds remained strong. Cabinets billing trended back to normal levels, and we expect a large step-up in cabinet billing in the first half of 2021. Bell Canada assets had a good start under the Equinix banner and our integration efforts remain on track. Our EMEA region saw solid bookings in the quarter, including our best intra region in 2 years, with firm pricing led by activity in both our Amsterdam and Frankfurt markets. Revenue growth remains strong, although we expect some 2021 moderation as we lap past our successful cross-connect repricing initiative in 2020. Also, we're investing broadly in our growth and emerging markets, or GEMs to meet the anticipated demand in these edge metros. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had its second best gross bookings quarter with a solid mix of small ecosystem-accretive deals in our Singapore and Japan businesses. Utilization rates remain high. We expect to bring new capacity online over the coming quarters in key markets to ease the anticipated capacity constraints. And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. At year-end, our balance sheet is greater than $27 billion, including unrestricted cash of approximately $1.6 billion, a meaningful decrease over the prior quarter due to the close of the Bell Canada asset acquisition and the settlement of debt refinanced in the quarter. Also, we moved our Paris 9 asset into the EMEA JV and closed our Japan JV with GIC in December. As a result, net of our equity investment, the JVs reimbursed us over $300 million in the quarter. At year-end, our xScale joint ventures had total assets on their balance sheet of greater than $1 billion, including the capital deployed. In 2021, you should continue to expect a meaningful increase in xScale activity. Our net debt levels remain low relative to our peers at 3.8 times, our Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA within our targeted range. Over the past 2 years, we refinanced a large portion of our historically high-yield debt structure. Yet, we still have another $1.8 billion of debt to refinance over the coming quarters, which at current rates would result in another $50 million plus of annualized interest savings. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $834 million, including a recurring CapEx of $74 million, a meaningful increase over the prior quarter, but as expected. Our construction and procurement teams continue to actively manage our expansion pipeline, delivering capacity at robust build levels, while incorporating the health, safety and well-being of our internal and external teams. Over the past year, we've experienced an average construction delay of a few weeks due to the pandemic, a trend that we will continue to monitor and assess. In Q4, we opened 4 new expansion projects, D.C., Frankfurt, Paris and Sa\u0303o Paulo. Additionally, we added 7 projects to our expansion tracking sheet, including our entre\u0301e into Genoa Italy in support of the subsea cable landing station opportunity. Genoa 1 will have a direct fiber access to Milan 5, our new flagship facility in this metro ready to open in Q1. We continue to expand our ownership, acquiring land for development in Genoa, Madrid, Mexico City, Milan and Sa\u0303o Paulo. Revenues from owned assets currently represent about 55%. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our 147 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 84% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested, a step down over the prior quarter due to the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar on our non-U.S. stabilized assets. As a reminder, similar to prior years, we plan to update our stabilized asset summary on the Q1 earnings call. Now please refer to slides 11 through 15 for our summary of 2021 guidance and bridges. Do note, our 2021 guidance does not include any financial results related to the pending GPX India acquisition.  Starting with revenues for 2021, we expect top-line growth of 10% to 11%, reflecting the continued momentum in the business and favorable FX rates relative to the prior year. On a normalized basis, revenues are expected to grow 7% to 8% over the prior year. MRR churn is expected to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter for the year. For Q1, we expect the MRR churn to be at the lower end of this range. We expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 47%, excluding integration costs, the result of operating leverage in the business, offset by investments in our product, xScale and business simplification initiatives. We expect to incur $30 million of integration costs in 2021 for various acquisitions. 2021 AFFO was expected to grow 10% to 12% compared to the previous year. AFFO per share is expected to grow 8% to 10%, including integration costs. We've excluded any capital market activities here. 2021 CapEx is expected to be $2. 5 billion to $2.8 billion, including approximately $180 million of recurring CapEx spend, which represents about 3% of our revenues. This guidance also includes approximately $250 million of on-balance sheet spend related to xScale projects, which we expect to be reimbursed for in the future as we move or sell assets into either our current or our future JVs.  And finally, we expect our 2021 cash dividends to increase to slightly greater than $1 billion, a 10% increase over the prior year or an 8% increase on a per share basis. So let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles. Yes, why don't I just maybe add just a couple of other comments? I think the other thing that's very telling about '21 over '20, and particularly as you look into Q1, there's a meaningful step down in our non-recurring revenue. And as we've said before, it tends to be lumpy. We said there'd be a step-up in Q2. That ties in nicely to the incremental cabinet additions that we should -- we expect as a business. And so that's sort of playing into. The other thing that we can't lose sight of is the level of price increases that went through last year. And as I said in my prepared remarks, that we're going to lap over that. And so you get -- you don't get the same benefit, but you get it in your run rate. And then the last thing I would just say is that we continue to invest in xScale, and I talked about a lot of activity taking place there. But we're not yet banking on that as it relates to how the year will progress, either in fees or contribution from our equity interest in the JV. And so that's sort of what's going on with the business.  And again, when you look at overall, 10% to 11%, recognizing normalized is 7% to 8%. I'll tell you, maybe just one other thing that really comes to note here. Again, the Americas region grew about 4%, as I said last quarter in my prepared remarks. As you come through Q1, you'll continue to see relatively modest growth in the Americas, but then you'll see the acceleration through the last 3 quarters of the year. And that's what was really exciting about what we see in the plan. So part of it is just timing based, part of it is the impact of non-recurring revenue, part of it is the price increases. But overall, we feel very confident in the numbers that we put forth here. Yes, sure. Sure. Partly, we have to start off with last quarter, one of the things we spoke of last quarter was, there are a number of one-off items that were going through the quarter. And so then you look at the guide that we offered in Q1 and then for the year. I think it's important, one of the things we said is we'll see a recovery of that. There's some one-off costs that were in Q3. They were benefiting us or one-off benefits, I should say. There's one-off costs in Q4. But when you look into Q1, you get to see an EBITDA performance that is substantially up relative to what you would have previously maybe anticipated. Q1 tends to be one of our lower EBITDA quarters. But you can see that we're stepping it up unadjusted $19 million to $39 million. So it gives you a sense of meaningful step-up in the quarter, and that includes absorbing $10 million -- net $10 million that I would refer to as seasonal costs. And then as you look through the tail end or through the next 3 quarters, typically, you'd see -- typically what you'd see in how we're modeling it is, our EBITDA margins would continue to increase throughout the year. And then you sort of take that thinking on a lot of what Charles has said, and then you sort of translate that into our AFFO. Again, one of the things we said, if you look at it in total, AFFO is growing nicely. When you look at it at the share level, it's growing 8% to 10%. So the fact of the matter is, if you back out integration costs, which are, again, they're specific to -- generally to the acquisition of Bell Canada, you're going to see our AFFO per share grow about 10% to 12% this coming year. So there's a lot of value coming into the business. There's a lot of value coming from xScale. But there's still the potential of much more to come if we execute against our strategy. And as I said in at least in my prepared remarks, there is a tremendous amount of activity that we will be embarking upon through this year with xScale. And we're optimistic that, that will continue to drive more value to not only the margin line, but also to our core metric, which is AFFO per share. Sure. So again, a lot like what Charles said on in his prior remarks, there was still a little higher churn than we originally anticipated in the fourth quarter. Part of it was in Europe, in reference to a managed services provider, but there was some in the U.S. We're at a point now where we believe that we've made the turn. And then as I said, first quarter, you're going to feel in the guide that we give you, goes a little bit soft, but predominantly soft in the sense that I would expect more of -- we're taking about $20 million out of the non-recurring line in the first quarter. And so what you're really seeing is the momentum pick up from the installed cabs -- pardon me, the backlog to be installed cabinets in Q1 and then in Q2. And so there are deals that we've signed, effectively, they're booked, just not installed. And so we are going to see that momentum. And that's why we have the confidence not only in where we think the revenues will go but also the momentum that we will see through the rest of the year. Sure. So specifically, as it relates to our capital market activity, again, we're very specific about we didn't want to include anything in the guidance. So again, if you take out integration cost, AFFO per share will grow 10% to 12%. So we feel really good about where we are. And as you will -- I think many of you will recall, based on the June 2018 Analyst Day, we thought anywhere from 8% to 12% was a reasonable growth rate for AFFO, and we're tracking well against those models that we developed back in 2018. That all said, when you look at what we plan to do this year, we have a very large capital build. The thing I think of the most is how do we go to our lowest cost of capital, which is basically incremental debt. And so what you're going to see is we're going to refinance out of the debt as appropriate. We'll pick our timing accordingly. We'll get over some period of time the annualized benefit of $50 million plus. And then to the extent that we can or we have capacity, we theoretically could raise a little bit more debt because, again, that would be our cheapest source of capital.  As you're also aware, we do have our ATM program. Last year, we announced a $1.5 billion program, but we'll use that appropriate. As market conditions allow, we would walk through the door. To the extent they don't, then we would preserve that capital for a later date. But again, we're always going to bring a little bit of balance to our capital structure. We're going to make sure that we have liquidity on our balance sheet. We have the cash right now, as we announced in our prepared remarks, $1.6 billion plus $2 billion of incremental liquidity from our line. And I'm just -- I remain very optimistic about the amount of cash that we generate in the business as well as the return of capital from the JV as we continue to invest in building out some of these assets, we'll get some more incremental capital from our JV partners as we scale the business. So again, Colby, I think it's a great question. 8% to 10% is sort of a very comfortable range and where we feel we can deliver in \u201820 -- in through 2021. And we'll update you further on -- I think we're going to do the June analyst -- at the June Analyst Day, we'll update you a little bit further on our longer-term view of what we think we can accomplish as a company. Yes, I'll take that. David, and in fact, that was referred to the one-off -- I'm referring to the one-off adjustment in my prepared remarks. So basically, it was an accounting adjustment that we made in the fourth quarter that saw the step down in colocation revenues between the 2 quarters. So we saw a step-up in Q3 and then a step down in Q4. Managed -- pardon me, managed service providers go through our MIS line. Just so you know."

            "name": "Charles Meyers",
            "content": "Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. I hope that 2021 is off to a great start for all of you and that you and your loved ones are safe, healthy and ready for an exciting year ahead. As I reflect on the extraordinary events of 2020, it's clear we are living in a time unlike any other in our history. Without question, the COVID-19 pandemic changed nearly every aspect of our lives. For some, the impact has been and continues to be devastating. Our hearts and our support continue to go out to those suffering or facing great loss. Despite the rapidly changing landscape, our focus has remained clear. Ensuring the health, safety and well-being of our employees, customers and partners, keeping our data centers safely operating around the world and continuing to be a source of strength for our communities. I'd like to take a moment here to thank our employees for not only enduring but excelling in the face of adversity and for powerfully demonstrating our commitment to be in service to: in service to each other, to our customers, to our shareholders, and to the communities in which we live and operate. In the midst of all that has transpired, our business model has proven resilient, and we continue to innovate, execute and deliver for our customers. We closed over 17, 500 deals in 2020, reflecting the strength of our value proposition and highlighting the tremendous scale and momentum of our go-to-market engine. We expanded our scale and reach, both organically and through M&A, solidifying our position as a leading digital infrastructure provider in Canada, entering the Mexico market and announcing our GPX transaction in India, which we believe will be an ideal springboard in this large and growing market. We completed 16 new expansions, our most active build year ever, and have a sizable construction roadmap still ahead to support our backlog and healthy pipeline. We've introduced transformative capabilities on Equinix Fabric and Network Edge, revolutionizing the way enterprises connect digital infrastructure and we launched Equinix Metal, a fully automated and interconnected Bare Metal as a Service offering that provides even greater flexibility for customers to place their digital infrastructure where they need it, when they need it. We also had a very active year in the capital markets, leveraging our investment-grade ratings to refinance our debt, driving substantial interest savings into the business as reflected in our AFFO per share metric. For the year, we delivered $6 billion in revenue, completing our 72nd consecutive quarterly top-line increase and amazing 18 years of continuous revenue growth. In terms of the road ahead, one post-pandemic reality is already clear: our world is increasingly and inescapably more digital. Digital is reshaping our everyday lives and is impacting every element of our customers' businesses, not just how they interact with their customers, but how they interact with their data, how they collaborate and innovate, how they support their employees, how they engage partners, how they architect their network. Everything is changing. Digital transformation is reshaping the competitive landscape across every sector of the global economy and is fueling demand for a new generation of digital infrastructure. Infrastructure that is more distributed, more cloud connected and more flexible, characteristics that represent the hallmarks of Platform Equinix.  As service providers build out their infrastructure to capture burgeoning digital demand and enterprise customers embrace hybrid and multi-cloud as the architecture of choice, Equinix continues to play a key role as a nexus for advancing their digital transformation journeys. We believe that the overall market for digital infrastructure will continue to expand significantly, creating a massive long-term opportunity for those providers able to adapt to the evolving needs of digital buyers. We believe Equinix is uniquely positioned to capture this expanding addressable market, and we entered 2021 with a clear set of priorities to build on our market leadership, reinforce our competitive advantage and invest in targeted ways to position us for sustained value creation. First, supporting our people and strengthening our extraordinary culture will continue to be at the center of our strategy. People are foundational to how we will navigate the challenges and opportunities ahead. And our goal is to ensure that our culture creates a sense of opportunity and belonging for all our employees, affording us a durable source of competitive advantage. This year, we're expanding our award-winning sustainability ambitions, a priority that has resonated with both employees and customers as diversity, inclusion, social justice and climate change all remain front and center on the global stage.  Equinix is an important component of greening digital infrastructure, and we have seen a significant increase in customer interest in this area. We continue to expand our efforts around renewables coverage, energy efficiency projects, green building certifications as well as our pursuit of science-based targets and innovative techniques to push sustainability forward in all 3 regions. Second, we will focus on simplifying and scaling our business to drive long-term operating leverage and enhance our customer experience. This will include targeted efforts aimed at streamlining and automating, ordering and billing, enabling channel self-service and delivering enhanced digital engagement options for our customers. In parallel, we'll continue to evolve and scale our highly productive go-to-market engine, investing in more quota-bearing headcount and leveraging our growing channel to amplify our reach to prosecute the opportunity in front of us. Third, we'll continue to expand our global reach with an ambitious plan across both retail and xScale in direct response to customer demand.  And fourth, we'll accelerate our digital services business, adding new product capabilities, expanding market availability and augmenting our go-to-market motion, all aimed at accelerating new customer acquisition and positioning us for future growth as we drive attach rate across our expansive customer base. Turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for the full year were $6 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 8% year-over-year and AFFO per share grew 12% year-over-year. Interconnection revenues grew 14% year-over-year, driven by strong adoption of Equinix Fabric and solid interconnection adds. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our longer-term product roadmap and platform vision continue to advance to support our position as the world's digital infrastructure company. We now have over 392,000 interconnections and continue to build out ecosystem density across our metros. In Q4, we added an incremental 7,700 interconnections, more than our top 15 competitors combined, fueled by continued strength in network and cloud connectivity. Internet Exchange saw significant increases, both in port capacity and traffic growth, with peak traffic up 8% quarter-over-quarter and 43% year-over-year, driven by cloud, content and gaming segments. Equinix Fabric also saw strong growth, driven by port additions as well as existing customers upgrading to higher speed connections and increasing their use of our intra-metro offering. We also launched a new capability that allows Equinix Fabric users to quickly and easily connect to any other customer on Platform Equinix, unlocking the full value of our scaled digital ecosystems. And with Equinix Fabric integration built into both Network Edge and Equinix Metal, digital leaders are finding it easier than ever to use Equinix to create and connect their foundational infrastructure. In its first quarter as an Equinix branded product, Equinix Metal demonstrated solid momentum and is now available in 8 global metros, with plans for an additional 10 markets early this year. On the xScale side of our business, we continue to be very pleased with our JV strategy and are making significant progress expanding the reach and scale of that business. As planned, xScale is enabling us to extend our product set, capture hyperscale demand and deepen cloud density, while leveraging our balance sheet with the JV structure. We have an ambitious plan for 2021 and are resourcing xScale to accelerate growth. Plans include incrementing our existing JVS, entering in new markets such as Australia and evaluating new options to broaden our reach and leverage our existing land bank. We currently have 8 xScale builds underway, spanning all 3 regions and are moving forward with the second phase of Tokyo 12, given early success in this market. Now let me cover highlights from the verticals. Our Network vertical, again, achieved record bookings, driven by carriers upgrading core, edge and mobile networks to address shifting traffic patterns resulting from the pandemic as well as continued strength in enterprise resale. Network service providers have proven to be some of our most productive channel partners, which has led to sustained momentum in this vertical. New wins and expansions included Senia Networks, a Danish network provider, connecting to partners in Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Hong Kong and London, as well as a Fortune 500 cable operator, leveraging Equinix to re-architect core infrastructure for cloud access to support video-on-demand caching and delivery. Our Financial Services vertical also had a record quarter, led by multinational financial services firms, with particular strength in the Americas. Expansions included a Global 2000 fintech player, expanding their equity options present to access our dense financial ecosystem and a Fortune 500 insurance company, implementing a hybrid cloud strategy on Platform Equinix. Our Content and Digital Media vertical saw particular strength in video and digital advertising as companies are investing to bring their services directly to consumers. New wins, included one of the largest shopping and e-commerce retail groups, deploying infrastructure to support digital e-commerce activities; and Index Exchange, a top independent global ad tech marketplace expanding compute nodes to manage increasing traffic from customers. Our Cloud and IT vertical delivered solid bookings, increasing density and coverage of software-as-a-service providers and winning new cloud on-ramps in smaller markets, including Dubai and Melbourne. Expansions included Fortinet, a global cybersecurity platform provider, expanding to support scale and user experience; and ServiceNow, deploying infrastructure closer to users in Europe to optimize performance, enhance user experience and support their rapid growth. Our Enterprise vertical had a strong quarter driven by healthcare and retail as telehealth and digital initiatives see continued momentum. Work-from-home and collaboration-related use cases remain active, although less than pre-pandemic levels as enterprises shift their focus back to broader digital transformation initiatives. New enterprise wins included Atrium Health, the largest health system in the Southeastern U.S. deploying digital infrastructure to enable compliant, multi-cloud and business partner interconnection as well as a Fortune 500 manufacturing company deploying digital infrastructure at Equinix to facilitate cloud connection. And our channel program had another great quarter, accounting for 35% of bookings. We saw particular strength with our hyperscale and technology alliance partners, capturing wins across a wide range of industry segments focused on digital transformation efforts as well as pandemic response. New partner wins included a Canadian automobile parts manufacturer, accessing our network and cloud density to interconnect to the connected car and broader automotive ecosystems. We continue to expect channel bookings to be an important pillar of our go-to-market strategy in 2021 and beyond. Now, let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Thanks, Keith. In closing, as 2020 showed us, our world is a very dynamic place. I'm proud of how we have navigated and adapted through this challenging environment, and I'm pleased with our increasing momentum in unlocking the tremendous opportunity ahead. We had a strong finish to the year, delivering across each of our areas of strategic focus, all while maintaining a disciplined and long-term oriented approach to our capital allocation and shareholder return strategies. Undoubtedly, as with all times of transition and transformation, there will continue to be challenges ahead. But I am as optimistic as ever about our business and the opportunity to serve our customers, partners and shareholders as the world's digital infrastructure company. We need to continue to invest in extending our market leadership and ensuring our long-term relevance to the expansive opportunity presented by digital transformation. As a society and as a company, we learned a lot in 2020. And I believe there are a plethora of silver linings that will come from this past year. We enter 2021 filled with gratitude, ready to tackle the challenges and opportunities ahead and collectively energized by the pursuit of our purpose: to be a platform where the world comes together, enabling the innovations that enrich our work, life and planet.  So let me stop there and open it up for questions. Yes, why don't I -- I'll start, Mike, and then Keith, you can comment as you see fit. I think that we're seeing, as we've talked about in the past, it's getting harder and harder to grow on a very -- a much larger base, and I think -- and doing that while maintaining a level of discipline on the strategy. And so that's definitely our focus. We believe that that's the way to continue to drive value creation. We're seeing strong uptake in terms of customers being resonant with the value proposition, but it does take a lot of productivity to drive the bookings that are going to fuel the kind of growth rates that we're seeing at given the size of the business overall. I think in terms of the investments, yes, we do believe that those are going to continue to translate to us sustaining and hopefully maybe increasing growth rates over time. But I think -- and I think we've already seen that. I think without the investments that we've made in the past, into our product teams, in particular, and into other areas of business like xScale, I think -- I don't think we would have seen growth that we saw in 2020. And so I think it has been an opportunity for us to invest in the business and generate returns. I think one factor on operating margins, I think, in 2020, going into 2021, 2020 was an unusual year. And I think it was a difficult time for our world overall. I think we made a decision to both continue to invest in our people in various ways that we've given you visibility to in our last several calls. And give them confidence that they have their jobs. And I stand by that decision is the right one for the company, and I'm confident that the long-term return on that decision is compelling. But it's -- interestingly, I think as we -- I guess, partially expected employee turnover fell significantly. Because I think as people sought the security of a really strong employer like Equinix, and they probably fell even more than we anticipated. And it really, to some degree, reduces your range of motion as a business.  So I think when it falls and yet you're wanting to continue to evolve and adapt your workforce to the changing needs of business and the strategy at hand, you're left with the decision as to whether you add and kind of overrun where you thought you were going to be from a headcount standpoint or whether you delay doing that in an effort to sort of stay tighter on the expense side. Like many, we probably ended somewhere in between. And -- but undoubtedly, I think that's a contributing factor in terms of growth of SG&A as a percentage of revenue. And reversing that trend is a priority for us in 2021 and beyond. But we do feel like we needed to make these investments, need to continue these investments in the business because I think the opportunity associated with the digital transformation sort of needs of our customers are significant, and I think we're uniquely positioned to play into those. Keith, anything you want to add, buddy? Keith, you want to grab that? The one thing I would say on Packet is we don't really think about that as a regionally-oriented investment, it's -- since the capabilities are going to be deployed on a global basis. We definitely expect that to grow, seen a substantially over-index over the rest of the business, but we expect to see success across the regions on that. And then the other businesses also, I think, are likely to over-index, but I think there's other factors. I think it's more a sustained -- the sustained performance having really moved through, I think a lot of the churn that we're seeing associated with the Verizon assets and some of the churn that occurred through there and I think a stabilization business and are really -- several really productive bookings quarters from the Americas bookings into. No. It's -- we did say that, in fact, we had -- in the last call, we had said that this quarter, we expect it to be back in range. And we saw a little bit of timing, adverse timing again this quarter and a little bit of unforecasted churn that pushed us up to 2.6%. So I'm a tad reluctant to tell you we're back in range in Q1, but I do believe that's our firm expectation. So we -- I would say that there -- if you look at it, there were several churns over the last couple of quarters that were from acquired assets that were the types of deployments that we wouldn't generally be targeting. And so I don't think it's a fundamental sort of issue in the business as it is, I think, some of the things that weren't -- aren't really part of our strategy moving through. The other thesis that's similar to that is about 20 bps of the Q4 churn was associated with large, lower margin managed services deal in Europe. And so again, I think when you back those things out, you're really looking at sort of a level of churn performance within the business that's pretty consistent with our expectations. Churn is definitely a focus for us in the year ahead. And I do think kind of where we land on a full year on a revenue basis is going to really depend on where we can land in the churn range that we've forecasted through the course of the year. So it's going to be a critical area of focus for us. But nothing fundamental that we're seeing, just volatility in terms of -- or just movement in terms of people evolving their architectures and the normal frictional churn that exists in our business. But I think nothing beyond that. Sure. Yes. I mean, I would say that overall, we're incredibly pleased with the performance of our interconnection business and what that means for the broader performance of the business because interconnection isn't really -- even though we reported as a product line, if you will, and talk about the performance in its growth, and it continues to over-index meaningful versus the rest of the business, it's really a core part of the value proposition and fuels the rest of the business in terms of the strength of the value proposition when it comes to digital transformation. You mentioned specifically pricing, obviously, we had tremendous success implementing a pricing sort of normalization effort in Europe over the course of 2020. We're largely through that now. And so as Keith said, that's impacting the year-over-year compare on revenue growth in Europe, but we're now seeing those benefits sort of built into our run rate. In terms of broader opportunity for pricing adjustments, I think that we're continuing -- we'll continue to evaluate that. I don't -- I wouldn't see anything meaningful on the horizon for us there. I think we, obviously, are just coming off the European adjustments. But I think that we do have to continue to look at both our underlying costs and the trajectory of those and whether or not adjustments are needed for us to continue to maintain our margin profile. And then also, the real focus for us is looking at the value delivered to our customers. And we do think it is so substantial as they look at implementing Equinix Fabric, for example, as a foundational part of their hybrid multi-cloud architectures that we feel comfortable that we're going to be able to continue to get strong pricing from the interconnection offerings. And then last point, Keith did mention we're expecting sort of strong cabinet adds because of the strong backlog. And yes, that's going to -- it is going to continue to fuel interconnection because we're seeing really good sort of ratios in terms of -- because we're maintaining a level of discipline in the strategy, and we're not reliant on these super large footprint deals that are poorly interconnected, we are seeing cabinets fuel interconnection growth. And so overall, I think those things will move nicely in tandem. Yes. Sure. Yes, I mean, I talked about that we're really seeing digital take off and be a Board-level priority for people, and it's changing the way, as I said, people think about not only electronic commerce and digital interaction with their customers, but how they think about data and how they're using AI to create competitive advantage, how they're architecting their networks. And those last 2 examples are 2 really good ones of that are central to what we have in our funnel today and what's fueling our strong bookings on a quarter-over-quarter level. And that is that people thinking about using Equinix as a nexus for their data, locating their data there, intersecting it with cloud services across the globe to create insights and egress those insights to the people within the business that need them. And then network re-architecture has been bread and butter for us for a very long time in Equinix Fabric and then things like Network Edge and now Metal even adding to the mix there, really substantially improving the way people can -- and accelerate in the way people are thinking about network re-architecture. And in terms of how it's affecting our -- I would just say this. I think that if you look at our mix of business, if you look at the kind of volumes that we're doing, 17,500 transactions over the course of the year, it is, we're really focused on those sort of -- on those sweet spots in our business where we can demonstrate differentiated value. And I think that's why we're seeing such strong pricing. We continue to see positive pricing actions and firm even spot pricing, in many ways, in our business because I think the value proposition is so strong.  And so -- and I -- but I do think it's still at a point where these are not really short sales cycles. There's a lot of solution selling still being done with us and through -- and in combination with our partners. And it's why we need to continue to invest in re-architecting and refining and adding capabilities to our selling organization, including scaling our channel. And so those are areas of investment we're making. And I do think that the prospect is, over time, that those -- I would say that I don't think sales cycles are lengthening. And in fact, if anything, I think they're starting to shorten, in particular, follow-on sales cycles, meaning after you've already brought a customer in, that first win with the customer is still -- it can be pretty extended. But follow-on sales cycles, I think, are shortening. And I think that hopefully, that points to us continuing to add even further productivity from the selling engine going forward. Yes, we talked about that in the past and generally said that it's not a big priority for us. We think that the competitive intensity of sort of the hyperscale business in the U.S. is significant. I would say capacity -- supply and demand are coming more into line in the U.S. markets, whereas I think they were a little out of balance for a while. So I think that's a good improvement overall for the industry. I would say we're -- never say never in terms of whether -- if a customer really had a specific need that they wanted us to be working with on, we'd be receptive to it potentially. But I would say that we're so comfortable and confident in our -- in the durability of our interconnection value proposition in the U.S. and in the strength of our ecosystems, both network, cloud and others, that I think the strategic imperative is a little bit different. And so it wouldn't be a key priority, but I do think we'll be open-minded about opportunities as they might surface. Yes. I mean I do think that we're seeing -- in fact, if you look over a multiyear period, I think you've seen a pretty substantial acceleration of the enterprise component of our business. And I think that is really tapping into the traditional service provider density that we -- and ecosystem density that we have as well as our geographic reach and how that plays into hybrid and multi-cloud and distributed architecture as an end state for enterprise customers. And so it's interesting because if you are -- the way we report externally, it has network service. We talk about our Network segment, our Financial Services segment and then Enterprise. In reality, all of those 3 segments have significant enterprise components because our enterprise resale and the network vertical is reported there in terms of how we look at that, but we have a meaning piece of that -- meaningful piece, which is Enterprise business that's sold through a network service provider partner. And then on the Financial Services side, yes, we have our trading ecosystem, but actually, the larger piece of that is Enterprise Financial Services business. And obviously, Enterprise I mean, financial services is one of the markets with a very large IT spend and a very, I think, thoughtful and aggressive agenda about moving to hybrid and multi-cloud as their long-term architecture. So all that has created this enterprise momentum for our business over the last several years and I think that absolutely continues into 2021. And like I said, I think that our selling engine is quite productive. It's not yet -- I don't think we're -- we haven't crossed the chasm by any means, but I actually think that's a -- it's really a good thing when you look at the overall Equinix thesis because I think you're looking at a very large addressable market, and we're still in the early innings of tapping that market. And so that means that solution selling takes a little bit longer to get people over the hurdle and really get them through thinking about their hybrid and multi-cloud end state and how we play in that. But as you -- I think as you get them over the hurdle, there's just a lot more wallet share to be gained. And so I think there is an acceleration opportunity for us. And I would expect enterprise to over-index as a segment for us in 2021. Sure. Keith, you want to start maybe with a view of kind of what the moving parts are on the guide? And then your thoughts on that and I'll add color as needed? And I guess the additional color I might add, Sami, is just -- I do think that we -- we're generating operating leverage. And as I've said in past years -- last year, I guess, that we just are more than offsetting that operating leverage by investments in this case and this year into the product team and into xScale as well as into our, what we call Project Horizon, which is an effort to really simplify and automate elements of the business, and I referred to some of those in my prepared remarks, and I think those are areas that we do need to bend the cost curve in the business. And I think that expanded operating margins are and -- are still a priority for us going forward. And again, I think we -- rather than try to squeeze it too tight and not make enough room to open up the longer-term opportunity, we made a decision to make those investments this year, and we think that's the right one. Over -- but I think we also need to make sure that we're seeing those investments translate into operating leverage over time. So we continue to believe that we can, over a multiyear basis, expand operating margins and see additional leverage. Keith why don't you grab that and I'll come back. Yes. Just the only other thing I might add is that we continue to also be very focused on delivering not only cabs, but delivering the yield that we're going to get from those cabs. And that's really a matter of continuing to be disciplined on the workloads and the opportunities that we're pursuing. And I think we're seeing good success there in terms of preserving very high sort of yields per cab. And I think over time, our product portfolio is going to allow us to continue to expand yield effectively as well or at least sustain at the very high levels that we have today. That, combined with the backlog sort of translation, I think, are good signs for the Americas business. Yes. If you're talking about, I think, the broader U.S. colo market beyond our U. S. and Americas colo market, I do think there is -- the dynamics may create pressure on that market and which is why I think we need to continue to distinguish ourselves and focus our -- be very disciplined about our targeting and how we're prosecuting the business. I think there's always a continuum in terms of the strength of the value proposition and therefore, how differentiated you can be on pricing. But again, I would point to the fact that we, across our regions are quarter-over-quarter demonstrating positive -- net positive pricing actions, meaning that when we do have a reprice, for example, those are generally being offset by our ability to sustain pricing increases in our contracts, which I think is a really good sign for the business in terms of our ability to do that. So I think undifferentiated colo is going to continue to struggle to maintain price points. And people are either -- are looking for either lowering price and/or looking for new ways or new markets, a lot of them tilting towards hyperscale, which they're certainly not going to find a lot of relief on pricing there. And so I do think the broader market has a translation or a challenge there. But I think we've -- we're not immune from that, but I think we're substantially more insulated, and I think our metrics really demonstrate that. Do you want to start on that, bud? And then, Colby, on the stabilized assets, we've been saying 3% to 5% on that, and we're kind of right in the middle of that range. And so I think that's probably -- we expect to sort of continue to operate in that range. Sure. Thanks, Jonathan. Yes, we continue to invest in Equinix Fabric and the feature set thereof. I talked a little bit about the recent capability we developed, which allows customers to more easily interconnect to any other Equinix customer on the Fabric. Metal, obviously, has been a significant area of investment, and we're excited to expand the capabilities there in terms of -- or expand the reach of that out now to 18 markets will get to early in '21. We're also investing in the go-to-market motion to continue to adapt that. We're currently executing with an overlay and continuing to refine our thinking on how best to scale that market, but accelerating our overall digital services portfolio, which would include Fabric and Metal and Network Edge and others is a clear priority for us in the year ahead, as I said in our prepared remarks. So we're really excited we believe because you did put that in the context of -- we think that, that can continue to drive yields. We think return on invested capital for those offerings is going to be very attractive over time. And we think, importantly, they're really responsive to the needs of our customers as they think about how digital transformation -- what their digital transformation journey looks like. So you'll hear a lot more from us on what the multiyear view is for those products as we move towards Analyst Day. And then Fed, look, we actually -- we're bullish. We think that there's more opportunity we -- and I think it's something that we're putting a little bit of energy behind. And I can't speak in significant depth on. I know Karl is excited about the opportunities that exist there, and it's something that we're going to continue to be active in trying to pursue the right kinds of opportunities that fit the Equinix value prop. Keith, do you want to take that? Yes. I mean, we had talked about -- at Analyst Day, we talked about yields or cash-on-cash yields in the low double-digits -- low to mid-double digits. I've said on a couple of occasions that I think there's been more pressure on those returns and on cash-on-cash yields in the hyperscale space just because of overall supply demand dynamics and a lot of people sort of shooting at that target. And so I think you're looking more at the lower end of that. And I think still seeing either very high single-digit or low double-digit cash-on-cash yields. But I think when you look at it from our standpoint and with both fee structure that exists there and then leverage that exists, I think you're able to get substantially more attractive project returns that are going to be into that double-digit range."

At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles. \nCharles Meyers: Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. This year has been an exceptionally challenging one, as we all continue to navigate the economic, health and societal changes happening in our world. Despite these challenges, we find Equinix in a unique position to help our customers adapt, respond and accelerate digital transformation, a key priority for business across every sector and a critical driver for economic recovery. With over 10,000 customers cultivating and curating ecosystems that enable digital business remains central to our strategy and has been accelerated by COVID, as businesses shift to operating, selling and expanding online. As we respond to these shifts, we remain focused on driving disciplined growth, extending our global leadership and effectively scaling our business. We are augmenting our capabilities and enhancing our service portfolio in targeted ways to expand our addressable market, responding to evolving customer requirements and ensuring that we remain well positioned for the future. We continue to complement and extend our global platform, both organically and through acquisitions, enhancing cloud and network density and offering our customers the richest range of options to support their adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud as the architecture of choice. Platform Equinix allows our customers to more effectively distribute infrastructure, putting connectivity, data, security and applications where they need them and interconnecting them easily to the cloud, delivering the performance required to service increasingly global digital businesses. In October, we closed the acquisition of Bell Canada's data center portfolio, positioning Equinix as a leading national provider in Canada, while giving Canadian customers the global reach they need. We also announced our long-awaited entry into India, one of the world's largest economies and fastest-growing data center markets, and now the 27th country served by platform Equinix. Once completed, our GPX acquisition will add two highly interconnected data centers in Mumbai and will serve as a critical foundation for Pan-Indian expansion. Our global reach remains as important as ever, combining unparalleled facilities-based coverage with integrated systems, delivery and care. This competitive differentiation continues to drive our business, with revenues from multi-region customers increasing 1% quarter-over-quarter to 74% and revenues from customers across all three regions remaining at a healthy 62%. The Americas continues to lead in exporting business to our other regions, as network, cloud, financial and manufacturing customers take advantage of our reach. We continue to deepen our penetration of the Fortune 500 and Global 2000 and the consistent growth of our top accounts demonstrates the depth of our addressable market and the stability of our business despite the pandemic, with over 90% of our top 50 accounts increasing their business with Equinix quarter-over-quarter. As we grow the business, we are also investing in our future, by making Equinix a place that attracts and inspires diverse talent and making sure that our mission reflects our responsibility to leave our world better than we found it. Equinix was recently recognized as one of the top companies for diverse talent and received the 2020 Green Power Partner award from the U.S. EPA, recognizing our contribution to helping advance the development of the nation's green power market. In September, we issued our first green bond offering as a mechanism to further invest in innovative designs and technologies, meaningfully increasing our efficiency and resource consumption to ensure we continue to operate sustainably and advancing our commitment to reach 100% clean and renewable energy across our portfolio. Turning to the quarter, in Q3, we continued to adapt our selling engine, tapping into a healthy demand environment to deliver another strong bookings performance. These results were driven by continued strength in channel bookings, solid interconnection growth and firm pricing. And the quality and quantity of our pipeline looks strong as we close out the year. We continue to instrument and automate our business to support high deal volumes closing over 4,400 deals in the quarter across more than 3,100 customers with a significant quantity of these orders serviced through digital interfaces giving our business superior predictability and creating a huge opportunity to drive attach rates for interconnection and other incremental services. Turning to our results, as depicted on slide 3, revenues for the third quarter were $1.52 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 11% year-over-year and AFFO was again meaningfully ahead of our expectations. Interconnection revenues grew 15% year-over-year as both unit volume and pricing continued to trend favorably. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. We now have over 386,000 interconnections with 14 of our top metros having ecosystems with over 10,000 interconnections and growing. In Q3, we added an incremental 8,500 interconnects more than the next 15 competitors combined, driven by work from home, video streaming, and enterprise cloud connectivity. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 43% year-over-year with a 7% quarter-over-quarter step-up albeit returning to a more normal revenue growth rate after the surge of capacity buying in the previous quarter. Equinix Fabric also had a great quarter eclipsing the $100 million in annualized run rate with over 2,300 customers fueled by broad-based adoption across all verticals and geographies. As cloud adoption continues to accelerate, we are also making great progress extending our leadership in the cloud ecosystem, capturing new cloud on-ramps and continuing to expand our xScale business. We're seeing strong demand for our assets in our initial European JV and are on track to close our new JV in Japan with GIC in Q4 adding locations in Osaka and Tokyo. We've already signed our first xScale deal in Japan, securing a key anchor tenant who will take the full Phase one capacity of Tokyo 12. And in Q3, we toppled the final domino to give Equinix direct cloud on-ramps for all five of the top clouds across 11 of the metros most critical for global infrastructure deployments: Silicon Valley, D.C., Chicago, S\u00e3o Paulo, Amsterdam, London, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo, nine more global markets than any other provider. We continue to adapt Platform Equinix to the evolving needs of our customers. And despite the significant challenges of integrating a new team during COVID, we effectively merged our Packet and Equinix road maps and launched our integrated Equinix Metal offering in four global metros with plans for an additional 10 by early 2021. Equinix Metal is a feature-rich and fully automated bare-metal service giving our customers the option to deploy the physical infrastructure of their choice at software speed across our platform, enabling digital leaders to place infrastructure where they need it when they need it. Equinix Metal is also directly integrated into Equinix Fabric helping enterprises quickly interconnect to thousands of networks, enterprises and clouds on Platform Equinix advancing our vision to make Equinix the world's digital infrastructure company. Now, let me cover highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical continues to be a foundation of the platform, achieving its second best bookings driven by carriers expanding capacity for digital business. New wins with local telcos included Airtech Internet, a Latin American fiber Internet provider deploying a network hub to improve peering and performance; and Mint Telecommunications, a British regional network provider deploying infrastructure for increased performance, security and scale. Our financial services vertical had a solid quarter led by EMEA and the insurance subsegment. New wins included a Fortune 500 commercial bank, simplifying their digital ecosystem, as well as expansion with BidFX, a subsidiary of Singapore Exchange Group adding new colocations for its FX trading solutions. Our content and digital media vertical saw particular strength in markets catalyzed by the shift to virtual, including video, social media and gaming. New wins included Rakuten Mobile, selecting Equinix as the foundation to deliver its communication platform to global operators and enterprise customers; as well as an online real estate brokerage, interconnecting to enrich digital experiences for our customers. Our cloud and IT vertical continued to over-index significantly with strength in the Americas and in infrastructure and software sub-segments as adoption of hybrid cloud continues to accelerate. We remain focused on enhancing our market-leading cloud density adding eight cloud on-ramps this quarter alone, and bringing us to 160 direct cloud on-ramps at Equinix, or 42% market share in our metros. Our enterprise vertical had another great quarter with particular strength in health care and manufacturing. New enterprise wins included health care companies Maxor Pharmacy Services; Sandata Technologies; as well as Guardant Health, a leading precision oncology company. Our channel program continues to deliver great results accounting for over 30% of bookings and generating over 60% of all new logos. We had great wins with reseller and alliance partners including Cisco, Microsoft, Oracle, WWT and Zenlayer, across a wide range of industry segments. Channel partners are also contributing to the success of our new market expansions, we're excited to expand our relationship with Bell Canada, as a strategic partner working to deliver industry-leading joint efforts -- joint offers in Canada and globally. This partnership also allows Equinix to engage with Bell resale partners to build stronger relationships across the Canadian channel ecosystem. Other notable wins this quarter included Alestra in our recently acquired Mexican assets for an upscale retail chain and Capgemini in S\u00e3o Paulo for a Fortune 100 pharma firm, both transitioning from on-premise data centers to hybrid multicloud solutions for elasticity and scale. Now, let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. \nKeith Taylor: Thanks Charles and good afternoon to everyone. I hope you and your families are doing well during these unique times. As Charles noted, despite the challenges in 2020, our team continues to deliver. Equinix' leadership is so very grateful and thankful for the almost 10,000 employees that come to work every day to make Equinix a success. We have a fabulous team and culture. This makes a huge difference. As it relates to the quarterly financials, we delivered another strong quarter with revenues, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO, and AFFO per share ahead of our expectations. We had significant growth in PAG bookings and once again benefited from net positive pricing actions. Performance against virtually every key operating metric was positive. Interconnection activity remained healthy with net adds towards the higher end of our targeted range resulting in strong MRR per cabinet step-ups in each of our three regions. In September, we entered into our third debt financing initiative in less than a year raising another $1.85 billion. We used the proceeds of this debt raise to refinance a portion of our existing debt on a net present value positive basis. Effectively, the interest savings more than offset the redemption premiums and unamortized debt issuance costs creating a financially attractive outcome for the company. As part of this capital raise, we issued our inaugural green bonds demonstrating Equinix' continued long-term commitment to green our data center footprint and deliver wide-reaching environmental benefits not only for ourselves and our communities but also for our customers. And we established a green finance framework that raises the bar for sustainability in the data center industry. This new framework targets elite, gold, or better on new construction an objective to design average annual power usage effectiveness or PUE to 1.45 or better which also exceeds industry benchmarks. To-date our refinancing activities has resulted in annualized interest savings of approximately $125 million. We have another $1.8 billion of debt to refinance which at current rates could result in another almost $50 million of annualized interest savings. Now, let me cover the quarterly highlights. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on slide four global Q3 revenues were $1.52 billion, up 9% over the same quarter last year, our 71st consecutive quarter of revenue growth. Q3 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $13 million benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates largely due to a stronger euro and British pound. Global Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $737 million or 49% of revenues, up 2% compared to the prior quarter and 11% over the same quarter last year meaningfully better than expected due to strong operating performance; favorable one-time benefits including a reduction in COVID-related bad debt reserves given strong customer collection activities; and timing of repairs and maintenance and other spend shifting between our Q3 and our Q4 quarters. Adjusting for the shift in EBITDA between quarters and after normalizing for FX and the Bell Canada asset acquisition, adjusted EBITDA was consistent with our expectations and we expect Q1 2021 adjusted EBITDA margins to return to traditional seasonal levels. Our Q3 adjusted EBITDA performance net of our FX hedges included a $6 million net FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 AFFO was $580 million above our expectations on a constant currency basis largely due to strong operating performance and lower income tax expense but offset in part by higher seasonal recurring CapEx spend. As a reminder, our Q4 quarter typically includes higher recurring CapEx spend compared to any of our other prior quarters. Turning to our regional highlights whose full results are covered on slides five through seven. EMEA and APAC were our fastest-growing regions by revenues on a year-over-year normalized basis at 16% and 11% respectively followed by the Americas region which stepped up to 5%. The Americas region saw its second consecutive quarter of record gross bookings with healthy pricing favorable deal mix and record exports to the other two regions. Americas net cross-connect adds were the highest we've seen in several years while we experienced negative billing cabinet additions in the quarter largely due to timing of churn. Also in the quarter, we experienced the churn of some lower power density footprints in some of our acquired assets. This occurred a quarter earlier than expected. Americas' billing cabinet additions should return to traditional levels next quarter and we expect a larger step-up in the first half of 2021. After quarter end, we completed our acquisition of 12 Bell Canada data centers and expect to close the remaining asset allocated to this transaction in November, positioning Equinix as a leading digital infrastructure provider in Canada, adding seven new metros and 500 net new customers to sell to across the platform. Our EMEA region saw strong bookings in the quarter with a healthy mix of small deals and new logo adds led by our London and Amsterdam markets. Interconnection was substantially up on a year-over-year basis increasing to 12% of the region's recurring revenues due to both strong volume performance and favorable pricing initiatives. IBX asset utilization remains high and more than half of our major expansion projects are being constructed in the EMEA region including four hyperscale projects related to our EMEA One JV with GIC. And finally, the Asia-Pacific region saw another strong quarter of bookings led by the Singapore and Japan markets. We're seeing early traction with our pending acquisition of GPX India with interest across all of our customer verticals for the Mumbai market. We expect to close the GPX acquisition in Q1 2021. And now looking at our capital structure. Please refer to slide 8. Our balance sheet remains foundational to our future success. We ended the quarter with $2.7 billion of unrestricted cash on the balance sheet. Our total liquidity included our unused revolving line of credit of $4.6 billion. Our net debt leverage ratio remains at 3.3 times our Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA. During the quarter we raised a net $197 million of equity completing our 2018 ATM program at an average price of $777 per share. As we complete this year and head into 2021 and beyond, we intend to enter into a new $1.5 billion ATM equity program, which runs through Q4 of 2023 under which Equinix may offer and sell from time-to-time our common stock for working capital and general corporate purposes. As we've stated before an ATM program is an efficient capital-raising tool that we've used to fund our various business initiatives. And we continue to expect to use a balance of debt and equity to fund our future business needs, and we'll continually seek to maximize the long-term value attributed to our shareholders. Turning to slide 9. For the quarter capital expenditures were approximately $565 million, including recurring CapEx of $38 million. We opened three new projects in the quarter, including our entry into Muscat, Oman creating a second neutral hub along with Dubai for the region's networks and subsea cable traffic. Additionally, we added 50 new projects to our expansion tracking sheet, including our first expansion in Mexico following the Axtel acquisition in Q1, bringing our total significant builds to 41 projects across 25 markets and 18 countries, the result of a very strong customer pipeline. Approximately 75% of our major project spend is going to metros generating over $100 million in annual revenues, where we leverage the established ecosystem density and our installed customer base. And we continue to expand the ownership of land for development, including acquiring land in Bogot\u00e1, Frankfurt and Paris. Revenues from owned assets were 56% and we continue to expect this number to improve in the near term. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on slide 10. Our 148 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and generate a 28% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And please refer to slide 11 through 15 for our summary of 2020 guidance and bridges. Do note our guidance includes the anticipated financial results from the Bell Canada acquisition, excluding the Ottawa one facility, which we expect to close in Q4. Starting with revenues. For the full year, we expect revenues to grow 8% on a normalized and constant currency basis, which includes an incremental $39 million compared to the prior guidance through the acquisition of the Bell Canada assets and an expected foreign currency benefit offset in part by Packet revenues being slightly below our prior range and the deferred timing of Equinix custom order work, which we anticipate will move to early next year. MRR churn is expected to be within our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% for Q4. We expect 2020 adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 48%, excluding integration costs an incremental $21 million compared to prior guidance due to the acquisition of the Bell Canada assets and an expected foreign currency benefit. Also we expect to incur $20 million of integration costs in 2020. We're raising our 2020 AFFO, which is now expected to grow between 16% and 17% compared to the previous year through the acquisition of the Bell Canada assets and expected FX benefit and lower interest expense. For 2020, we expect AFFO per share to now grow between 10% and 11%. So, with that, let me stop here and I'll turn the call back to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thanks Keith. We're very pleased with our results this quarter. And as Keith noted, we're immensely grateful to our teams around the world who continue to keep the customer at the center of everything we do and are delivering sustained performance in the business. Even in these uncertain times companies in every sector are embracing digital transformation as a critical business priority and we are uniquely positioned to help our customers scale with agility and create digital advantage. Our consistently strong bookings and healthy interconnection growth give us confidence in the strength of our digital ecosystems and the depth of the addressable market created by broad scale digital transformation. We continue to invest in our strategy, evolving our platform in response to evolving customer needs, expanding our global reach to accelerate digital delivery, committing to a more sustainable future and ensuring that our culture is widely recognized as a place that attracts, embraces, inspires and develops exceptional and diverse talent. So let me stop there, and open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may go ahead.\nJordan Sadler: Thank you and good afternoon. So first I just wanted to touch on what you're seeing in the business and whether or not you're seeing any evidence of the enterprise positioning ahead of 2021 for a possible acceleration vis-\u00e0-vis sort of the digital transformation you referenced in your in the release and your remarks. \nCharles Meyers: Sure. Yes. No I definitely think we're -- I think we're continuing to see enterprise as a very strong sort of vertical for us and cloud -- both cloud and enterprise which are sort of the two sides of the adoption of hybrid and multicloud as the architecture of choice we're seeing that show up both on the supplier side in terms of really strong cloud performance and on the demand side of the ecosystem from enterprise. And so, I think what I've been really pleased with is our ability to continually generate both new logos and enterprise bookings despite COVID. We've adapted I think very well in terms of our selling and marketing engine, overall go-to-market approach in light of, what is now a largely virtual selling cycle. But yes, I think we are seeing enterprise continue to pick up in terms of their adoption of cloud. And I think we're going to be in a good position to continue to invest behind that. I think we're going to look carefully at the productivity of our sales teams and look to continue to add where we think that makes sense. But I think there's a lot of opportunity in front of us in terms of the enterprise opportunity. And if you look at how we're evolving the platform by adding things like Network Edge; continued success with Equinix Fabric which we talked about is a $100 million run rate business now; and then Packet which we now have in market -- in four markets with 10 more coming. I think those are all opportunities to expand the proposition for enterprises. \nJordan Sadler: And then just a -- one point of clarity on the guidance, you touched on a couple of things a couple of factors, but I just want to make sure I'm capturing all of it. The for the fourth quarter the implied AFFO guidance sort of suggests at the midpoint at least about a 15% decline from what you produced in 3Q. And I know there were a bunch of puts and takes. And I think the magnitude is smaller at the adjusted EBITDA line in terms of the decline. But maybe you could just walk us through Keith what's sort of driving that? \nKeith Taylor: Sure. Like anything in Q3, I mean you can see that we had just an excellent quarter. And I'd like to say that things generally balance themselves out but in Q3 we tended to have more goodies than we had baddies, if you will. And as a result we meaningfully overperformed relative to our guide. So let me try and put that in perspective for you because it -- so again when you look at the year in totality and you look at the margin for the year, we're right where we want to be and then you add an accretive transaction like Bell Canada. We're very -- we're delighted with what's going on and then throw on top of that currency. But as it relates specifically to the operating cost, there's really three main things that have happened between Q3 and Q4. So let me deal with Q3 first. There's roughly $15 million to $20 million of what I'd call favorables. And that favorable comes in three areas. One, repairs and maintenance was lighter than we had planned and because of that we have costs moving from Q3 where you got benefit into a quarter where we typically do more repairs and maintenance as we moved into Q4. So you have a roughly $11 million swing there quarter-over-quarter. The second one relates to utilities. And again no surprise to, I think many people on the call. Utilities does move around a lot. There's seasonality. But we had basically between one-off rebates and other things we had another sort of $5 million of favorable going through the utility line. And then you flip that into Q4 and we're going in the opposite direction where basically we have some settlements with our indirect power purchase arrangement for our sustainable energy. And so, you're swinging about $10 million there. And then the last thing that happened was effectively, as I said in the prepared remarks when we started the year as you might recall in Q1 we had basically a negative hit to revenues of $3 million and $14 million to EBITDA. At that time we took up a very conservative view on basically what the implications of COVID-19 would be on our business. And because customer collections have been very, very strong we're in a position to release a portion of the reserves that we created. And so we had a six -- I think about $6 million $7 million benefit in Q3. But the flip side is, as we move -- as we deal with COVID and the return to office and one-off payments to employees, we're moving to a negative 4%. So all of a sudden you've got everything going from if I could summarize it sort of a net -- a positive sort of $15 million, $20 million in Q3 to a negative $15 million, $20 million in Q4. And that's why I was very deliberate in my comment that once you get back to Q1 we get -- we return to our seasonal norm, if you will for EBITDA margins.  So again there's a lot of moving pieces a lot of favorability. And quite openly it's -- I think we've got a conservative guide on our Q4 numbers. But if everything went as anticipated that's what you would see. And yet we'd still deliver against our expectations for the year plus the uptick from currency and then Bell Canada. Long-winded response. I apologize for that. \nJordan Sadler: Okay, thank you for all the color. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Sami Badri with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. You may go ahead.\nSami Badri: Hi. Thank you very much for the question. I just wanted to touch on first the channel strategy. And you've obviously been doing a lot of trailblazing and creating new connections and new partners and formulating a much more robust sales motion than I think many of us really kind of thought about a couple of years ago. So, I was hoping you could give us a little bit of an update, not necessarily on the percentage of revenue flowing in from channel partners, but more specifically has this channel strategy now formulated to where you guys want it to be? Or is there still essentially a lot more to go with more channel partners to come and to complement your business complement, how you sell through or if you guys are going to continue selling with the channel? Just so we can understand how this could potentially evolve over the next coming years. \nCharles Meyers: Yes. Great question, Sami. The short answer is, I think, there is a long way to go still. I think a bunch of opportunities are still in front of us. As you've noted you were -- 30% of our bookings coming through the channel, but primarily on a sell-with basis. A lot of success in selling alongside our cloud partners and other technology partners who, I think, have aligned interest on -- sometimes somewhat begrudgingly, but sometimes quite -- in a quite embraced way on hybrid and multicloud as the architecture of choice. But, I think there is a way -- if you really look at it we -- one we probably actually have gone through a pretty normal cycle where we added a lot of partners realized that we weren't probably having that -- it was a smaller subset of them that we're really driving productivity and we've actually gleaned that a bit and more focused on the partners that really make a significant difference in the bookings now. But I think the areas where we have room to go is really finding those partners who have a more sophisticated selling capability and can sell on their own, who can create selling machine then complete this. And then also partners who bring complementary offerings that provide a more complete solution for our customers. And I think we're definitely seeing success and you could see companies like VMware who's a great partner of ours for people who've made big investments in VMware as their tool of -- tools of choice in terms company potential infrastructure within that environment and then sort of marrying that up with the value proposition that Equinix brings both in traditional colo and what we -- they might be doing there, but also with services like the Equinix Metal offering which we just brought to market off the backs of what we acquired with Packet. So I think there's a fair amount of opportunity there in terms of growing the channel and taking it to a new level. \nSami Badri: Thank you. And then one quick follow-up regarding just the xScale JV and initiatives. You've clearly had some new announcements in some new regions with GPX in India coming into the pipeline. Is there a potential for taking the xScale JV -- I want to say sales motion or opportunity into regions like in India and into potentially say Latin America where there is high growth and large opportunities for both hyperscale or just very large deals? \nCharles Meyers: Yes. We -- I think we've gotten comfortable with our ability to navigate some of the complexities associated with these things. As you will recall it took us a while get there on the xScale JVs and get them -- sort of, fully work through all the complexities that come with that. But I do think there's opportunity for us to extend that either directly in terms of just additional JVs which we have commented in this script and in others that we're already well underway on discussions in other markets where we think the JV structure will work effectively. And we think that that includes some of the markets that you described. But I also think there's other ways that we kind of think about potentially over time using, \u201cother people's money\" as a point of leverage in terms of getting financial partners who are really excited about the returns that we could offer and that would give us the ability to gain more runway out of our balance sheet and focus our firepower on the high-returning investments that are really down the middle for us. So I do think there's more opportunity for that there. I think the near-term focus is really going to be on additional markets where we would look at JVs and I think you'll be hearing more from that -- more about that from us in the coming quarters. \nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. You may go ahead.\nAri Klein: Thank you. Can you unpack the performance in the Americas a little bit? Churn was higher in the quarter. Maybe just address that whether or not that's something that could continue. And then you noted the expectation for improvement in the Americas, but how are you viewing the organic growth profile there? And what will specifically drive improvement from here? \nCharles Meyers: Sure. Keith maybe I'll start and you can add anything that you want there. But look we actually feel very good about the Americas business. We talked about over the last several calls that we expected to sort of return to about a 5% growth rate in the Americas towards the back half of this year and you're seeing that now. As you noted churn was a little bit higher. That was associated Keith actually mentioned that in his script really two larger deployments one that came in a quarter earlier than we thought the other one that was came in as forecasted in terms of churn. But candidly those were both deals that wouldn't have met our commercial hurdle in terms of deals we would have done in terms of our focus on really ecosystem-centric interconnection oriented footprints. And so even though we're seeing some -- we saw a negative billable cabs movement associated with that churn I think as we backfill that with the right kind of business that we're showing we can -- that we can find out there and deliver bookings on, I think we're actually going to get improvement on yields in the facilities that were impacted. So it's definitely a more mature market. We're working hard to continue to drive traction in the enterprise market and seeing good success there. I do think there is organic growth opportunity for us particularly in the enterprise market and also by the way using that selling force to export business to our other regions, which is playing a very, very key role in doing. So I think really that's the quick snapshot in the Americas. And again definitely a more mature market, it has returned to grow pretty nicely. I think we are going to see some of those churns come out that were deals that we wouldn't have really targeted prior. And I think as we stabilize we'll see continued improvements in yield. \nKeith Taylor: And Charles I would just add -- a couple of comments I would just add to what Charles said is number one when Charles made the reference to the fact these aren't deals that we necessarily would have done ourselves having now churned it -- churned those deals what you've actually effectively seen as our MRR per cabinet increase and it's part of the reason for that increase. The second thing that's really important is we are dealing with a mature market. But two points are worthy of note that were in our commentary. Number one, Americas had one of its best quarters ever. So that's another positive. But the interconnection activity continues to be exceedingly strong and that's on a net basis. And so you've got a very healthy ecosystem that's being developed. Then on top of that we're investing around our new products and services. So I only think over some period of time you're going to see an acceleration of that opportunity but you also will see a higher attach rate. And so despite some of the negatives that you see there are some real positives that are coming down the road. The last thing is in my prepared remarks I did make the comment that the Americas has been choppy. It's been choppy for a few years, but we are anticipating a return next quarter to a more normal billing quarter. And then we do anticipate a more meaningful step-up in the first half of next year.\nAri Klein: Thanks. And then just if I can briefly on the Packet acquisition. Can you just talk about what the customer response has been to metal? And then I think if you noted in the guidance that the growth has been a little bit lower than you expected maybe address that too.\nCharles Meyers: Sure. You bet. I'll tie those together. Yes, we had previously guided $32 million to $40 million. And I think that we're going to come in a little below that prior range. It's really an artifact of a decision that we made in terms of focusing on -- when we first did the acquisition our belief was that we would kind of let the existing Packet offering run for a period of time and then seek to launch a fully integrated Equinix Metal offer in early 2021. But the response frankly from customers was super positive in terms of our intentions to offer metal as an offering. And they were really encouraging us to bring together the feature set that we envisioned in our -- in the organic product that we had underway when we bought Packet. And so we decided to bring the teams together, but then we waited a bit in terms of we wanted to make sure we had the offering in market before we put the real wood behind the arrow from a sales enablement perspective. And so I think that resulted in us being slightly behind in terms of where we had hoped to be from a bookings and revenue standpoint. But if you look at it in terms of what we expect to deliver in Q4 and what that implies on an annualized run rate, about $30 million, it's really not too far off expectation. And I think the encouragement that we're getting from customers about what they believe is possible with the Equinix Metal offering as we enter new markets over the course of the first half for 2021. I think there's great opportunity there. So, we feel very good about it. We bought that business primarily because of the technology and the team and to really give us some credibility in a market we thought was super additive to our value proposition. And I would say along all three of those dimensions it has been what we hoped for. The team is terrific. We've seen very little turnover in that team. I think they're a great cultural fit. They've come together with our engineering team to really develop I think an Equinix Metal offer that's going to be very successful in the market. And we feel very optimistic about the path forward.\nAri Klein: Appreciate the color. Thanks.\nCharles Meyers: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi. You may go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: I was just curious as you're getting into the 2021 budgeting process if you could give us a preview on how you're thinking about balancing top line growth with the company's long-term margin goals to get above 50%. And then just secondly, in the quarter, I was curious if you can unpack some of the strengths in nonrecurring revenue sequentially and year-over-year and how to think about that level going forward?\nCharles Meyers: Sure. Keith, maybe I'll take the first one. You can comment on the second one if that works. You can add anything you want on the budget too. But we're kind of well underway on that. We do believe that it's -- and you've heard from us Mike over the years the same old song and dance if you will which is we really think about this as a long-term -- long-term value creation is our objective and we want to maximize the market opportunity and leverage our significant differentiation to do that. And I think that does require that we continue to evolve our service offerings and our platform to be adaptive to what our customers are asking for. And I think that will require investment. But we also have a focus on continuing to drive operating leverage in our business and converting that into margin expansion. And so, we continue to believe that that 50% is an achievable long-term target and we want to drive margin expansion where we can. I think if you look at the operating performance and the sort of EBITDA levels that our mature markets operate at, it's something that we ought to be able to achieve. And we're very focused on trying to make some investments in automation to drive operating leverage. And we'll -- and then we'll trade-off, when we drop that to the bottom line and give margin expansion versus putting that in and doing things like adding additional services to the platform and investing in further automation. So we'll come back to you obviously with more clarity as we align that, but that is the approach that we take and I do think it's going to be a journey still for us. And my -- on balance I would say I believe the opportunity is such that we ought to continue to invest in the business. And I think it would be a mistake for us not to do that. But we also need to make sure that we don't lose sight of the importance of operating leverage. \nKeith Taylor: And Michael, as it relates to the second question so this quarter we did -- roughly 5.8% of our revenues came from nonrecurring. In fact, that was a meaningful step-up as you note over the prior year and also over the prior quarter. In fact, we actually did a little less than we anticipated. We thought we'd do $4 million to $5 million more this quarter than we actually did here. That all said, I did make a comment that that deferred custom work that we do as a company will likely push into the first part of next year. And I think it's fair to assume for all the different reasons that somewhere between 5.5% and 6% is a reasonable nonrecurring revenue expectation. We'll certainly update that when we give the full annual guide in February. But that's a reasonable assumption to make vis-\u00e0-vis our nonrecurring revenues. And again, it's relatively -- it's 5.8% on average for the year -- it is for the quarter and it's not meaningfully -- it's not a meaningful departure from where we were year-to-date last year. So I think we're about $245 million year-to-date last year. At this point I think we're about $242 million $243 million year-to-date in 2020. So again, I'm comfortable in the 5.5% to sort of 6% range and then we'll update that accordingly.\nMichael Rollins: And Keith, just to understand the business activity under those dollars, can you describe what's happening in terms of -- is this representative of some of your customers that can't get to your facilities and they need your Smart Hands or they need your installation services more than they did in the past? Or is this tied to just the normal-course installations and what you're processing? Just curious if you can unpack a little more what that is. \nKeith Taylor: Yes sure. There's a number of things that certainly go on in that particular line. First and foremost, of course, there is the deferred installation revenue that we realize with every sale that we make. And certainly, there's a drag-along effect. For every MRR dollar we -- that we book there's an NRR dollar as well. And so you defer that over basically the relationship of that contract. Then in addition to that, there are -- at times there's goods for resale. There's custom work that we do as well. And think about a large -- perhaps a large hyperscaler or a large customer who's looking for build-out of their environment. And so we do some of that work and we do a fair bit of the work, particularly for the hyperscalers. And as a result, it can be a little bit lumpy. And it'd be custom cabling and installation work for the customer. So effectively they move in put their servers in or their equipment into their racks and they're good to go but we do all the prep work. Again, it's a great line of business for us. It varies in margin return. Again, we use in some cases our own workforce. But that's a line of business that generates roughly 25% to 30% margins. And it appears on the nonrecurring revenue line. \nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Colby Synesael with Cowen. You may go ahead.\nColby Synesael: Great. Just a few numbers-oriented questions. First off just to make the point. So we should be adding if I'm correct $15 million to $20 million back to our first quarter 2021 EBITDA when we're modeling before taking in the other considerations like seasonality. Is that correct?\nKeith Taylor: You say -- there's certainly the -- take away the seasonal aspects Colby as you know we have the FICA reset in Q1 and we also have our annual sales conference. So, if you put that aside and that's why I wanted to say back to traditional seasonal margins. That has ranged anywhere from 46% to sort of 48% to give you a sense over the last few years. But suffice it to say there absent any investment that we'd make given Charles' comments that is -- you're talking about $15 million to $20 million that would come out of the Q4 numbers. \nColby Synesael: Great. And then we add it back into the fourth -- into the first quarter number. \nKeith Taylor: Yes. \nColby Synesael: Okay. And then secondly, you guys gave guidance back in 2018 at your Analyst Day of 8% to 10% revenue and 8% to 12% AFFO per share. And you gave that guidance for each year through 2022. You normally have an Analyst Day every two years. It would have been in June of this year, but you didn't. Is that guidance that you gave back in 2018 in terms of how to think of the business still valid?  And then if I could just sneak one extra question in there, you gave guidance earlier this year for $0 to $50 million impact from COVID-19. Curious where are we in terms of the actual impact year-to-date and what the thinking is for the fourth quarter? Thank you.\nKeith Taylor: Charles, do you want me to take those? Or... \nCharles Meyers: Yes, there's a few of them there. Why don't we -- why don't you go ahead and jump in where you want there and I'll add. \nKeith Taylor: Okay. Well first and foremost Colby as it relates to the Analyst Day guide the 8% to 10% was a number that we embarked upon again in June of 2018. And as you know, we've done very well against those expectations particularly around AFFO per share again 8% to 10%. There's been a lot of activity. And so we've done a good job of normalizing both for currency and then for the acquisitions. And suffice it to say, we're -- we are a third, well I guess this is our third year into it and we're running ahead of what we originally told the market at that point in time.  As it relates to the next five years, it's probably a little early to give you a sense. But generally speaking, I feel very good about sort of the ranges that we were giving at that time. A lot has changed since then and we'll update you accordingly including some of the acquisitions we've made and we've been very active as a business.  But overall, I feel very good that we can deliver against that profitability target that we set for ourselves vis-\u00e0-vis on a per-share basis to make sure that shareholders recognize the value that we've delivered. I'm sorry\u2026\nColby Synesael: COVID-19 impact guide?\nCharles Meyers: Yes. COVID. \nKeith Taylor: As it relates to COVID again you're right. We basically set a relatively wide range as you know about then we targeted around midpoint. And you can see us starting to peel back some -- there's definitely some impact even as we talk a little bit about the Packet acquisition and just the difficulty on making sure that we could pull that all together as Charles said in a COVID world. That certainly slowed it down a little bit.  But put that aside for a second, I think, overall, the things that we were most worried about is what customers were going to go out of business? What payments were we not going to receive? What were the incremental costs? Certainly as a business again, we said $14 million of cost in Q1 on the EBITDA line. For all intents and purposes, we wrote back $6 million of that in the third quarter and then were going to book another $4 million of new costs in Q4. So net-net you're sort of somewhere in the $10 million to $15 million range on EBITDA. And I would say I feel pretty good about that.  As it relates to the top line, it's hard to quantify. There's certainly some impact from COVID. I think, I'd size it in the $20 million to $30 million range. And here's how we got there. For a number of reasons, we've had very good success in being able to book particularly on the gross line. There absolutely will. There will be some -- there has been some fallout of -- from COVID for companies that have gone out of business and we've made concessions and other things and so we're absorbing that.  But I also think there's been a timing implication. And the timing implication, particularly in Q2 and less on Q3, customers were having difficulties getting to sites and doing deployments and all that. And so the knock-on effect on the revenue line, again our estimate again as we share with our internally and also with our Board is probably at a $20 million to $30 million number. And so that sort of gives you a sense of the ranges that we've absorbed.  Again, we're delighted with where we are vis-\u00e0-vis all the -- what could have been when we first started here in Q1 and started locking things down. Clearly, we've done meaningfully better than we originally anticipated from that original guide. But that's I think because the company has been running exceedingly well and our customers have been paying their bills as they come due absent a few concessions that we'll be making here and there. \nCharles Meyers: Let me just add a little color on all of them. One just backing up to the very first question you had in terms of again, just to be clear, I think that what we're saying here is that the Q4 downtick which is apparent in the guide is really a matter of movement between Q3 which obviously significantly over performed on EBITDA that was pulled forward and shift in.  I think if you take that and you sort of adjust for that the movement between quarters, I think you would see a much smoother trajectory and then we would expect that to sort of continue to roll into Q1 with a margin profile that's more consistent with kind of what we typically see. So that's the, I guess, clarification, I'd offer on that one.  In terms of multiyear guide, we're going to come back and obviously provide that in -- hopefully, we'll get back to an Analyst Day here this year and we can offer that. But I do think that we continue to believe that our addressable market opportunity continues to grow. And I think we're going to continue to find a way to invest behind that. And then again on COVID, I think Keith gave the color. But there were a number of hard costs that we continue to see in that. There's definitely trade-offs and there are some things that are better. But we're also putting we've made significant investments in terms of trying to address our employee well-being during this period of time, putting investments in making sure that work from home is a good experience for our employees. And so there's been some hard dollars that have hit that. It's tough to put all of the revenue impacts fully into play -- or into perspective. But overall, I'd got to tell you I think we're extremely happy with how the team has performed despite the pandemic.\nColby Synesael: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from David Guarino with Green Street. You may go ahead.\nDavid Guarino: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I actually got two legislative-focused questions for you. The first one, with Prop 15 on the California ballot in November, could you help give us an idea of what the increase in Equinix' property tax bill would be, if that measure were to pass? And then the second one, in New Jersey., I'm just curious have you started having any conversations with some of your financial tenants, as a result of the proposed financial transaction tax there? And if you could just remind us what percentage of your cash gross profit comes from New Jersey that would be great also. Thanks.\nCharles Meyers: Yes. Let me jump on the second one first. And give a little bit of color. And then Keith maybe you can take Prop 15. And add any color on sizing potential impacts from the New Jersey thing. But what I would tell you is, yes, obviously we're deeply engaged with our financial trading customers. We have a very healthy ecosystem globally. And certainly New Jersey is an important one. I would tell you that those companies are designed with -- in partnership with Equinix to be highly resilient. And I think that they're going to make it clear that they can move their trading platforms around as they need to. Traditionally that has been in response to a disaster. I think some of them would consider the New Jersey tax a disaster that they would respond to. And I think we just -- and we're there as a partner to support them in terms of, making sure that they can continue to run their business effectively. So I think that it would be -- there would be a potential impact to that. But I think it would be a movement around the ecosystem, I think in terms of being able to re-stabilize that trading volume in other venues. And so, I personally think that -- I think people are -- cooler heads are going to prevail. And I think we will realize that that's probably not a great outcome. And it wouldn't accomplish what people had hoped for. And -- but we're very closely aligned with our trading customers. And I think in a coordinated approach to try to make sure people are thinking clearheaded about that.\nKeith Taylor: Thanks Charles. And then -- so I would say that, as it relates generally to the legislative matters that come in front of us particularly around tax, first and foremost as we -- I think we all know Equinix is a REIT, a U.S. REIT and because of that no matter what the outcomes are I think we're not going to pay much in the form of corporate income tax. I don't think that would be a meaningful change. As it relates to some of the propositions though, Charles, I think has highlighted well what our position on the New Jersey, financial transaction tax or the potential for that. Prop 15 in California. Again we have roughly 11 triple-net leases to give you a perspective. We own some of our properties. If it moved forward, Prop 15 moved forward, we would estimate it's not going to be a huge number. But it's probably going to be in the $5 million to $10 million range. That's the -- at least our estimate today of what could be. Again, we're paying very close attention to this. And again, we'll know over the coming quarters, basically on the outcome. And then, we'll update the investors accordingly on the future analyst -- future earnings calls.\nDavid Guarino: Great. That's helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And that was our last question. Speakers, I will turn it back to you, for closing remarks.\nKatrina Rymill: Thank you for everyone joining the Q3 call. That concludes the call.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference. All participants may disconnect, at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Keith Taylor",
            "content": "Thanks Charles and good afternoon to everyone. I hope you and your families are doing well during these unique times. As Charles noted, despite the challenges in 2020, our team continues to deliver. Equinix' leadership is so very grateful and thankful for the almost 10,000 employees that come to work every day to make Equinix a success. We have a fabulous team and culture. This makes a huge difference. As it relates to the quarterly financials, we delivered another strong quarter with revenues, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO, and AFFO per share ahead of our expectations. We had significant growth in PAG bookings and once again benefited from net positive pricing actions. Performance against virtually every key operating metric was positive. Interconnection activity remained healthy with net adds towards the higher end of our targeted range resulting in strong MRR per cabinet step-ups in each of our three regions. In September, we entered into our third debt financing initiative in less than a year raising another $1.85 billion. We used the proceeds of this debt raise to refinance a portion of our existing debt on a net present value positive basis. Effectively, the interest savings more than offset the redemption premiums and unamortized debt issuance costs creating a financially attractive outcome for the company. As part of this capital raise, we issued our inaugural green bonds demonstrating Equinix' continued long-term commitment to green our data center footprint and deliver wide-reaching environmental benefits not only for ourselves and our communities but also for our customers. And we established a green finance framework that raises the bar for sustainability in the data center industry. This new framework targets elite, gold, or better on new construction an objective to design average annual power usage effectiveness or PUE to 1.45 or better which also exceeds industry benchmarks. To-date our refinancing activities has resulted in annualized interest savings of approximately $125 million. We have another $1.8 billion of debt to refinance which at current rates could result in another almost $50 million of annualized interest savings. Now, let me cover the quarterly highlights. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on slide four global Q3 revenues were $1.52 billion, up 9% over the same quarter last year, our 71st consecutive quarter of revenue growth. Q3 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $13 million benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates largely due to a stronger euro and British pound. Global Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $737 million or 49% of revenues, up 2% compared to the prior quarter and 11% over the same quarter last year meaningfully better than expected due to strong operating performance; favorable one-time benefits including a reduction in COVID-related bad debt reserves given strong customer collection activities; and timing of repairs and maintenance and other spend shifting between our Q3 and our Q4 quarters. Adjusting for the shift in EBITDA between quarters and after normalizing for FX and the Bell Canada asset acquisition, adjusted EBITDA was consistent with our expectations and we expect Q1 2021 adjusted EBITDA margins to return to traditional seasonal levels. Our Q3 adjusted EBITDA performance net of our FX hedges included a $6 million net FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 AFFO was $580 million above our expectations on a constant currency basis largely due to strong operating performance and lower income tax expense but offset in part by higher seasonal recurring CapEx spend. As a reminder, our Q4 quarter typically includes higher recurring CapEx spend compared to any of our other prior quarters. Turning to our regional highlights whose full results are covered on slides five through seven. EMEA and APAC were our fastest-growing regions by revenues on a year-over-year normalized basis at 16% and 11% respectively followed by the Americas region which stepped up to 5%. The Americas region saw its second consecutive quarter of record gross bookings with healthy pricing favorable deal mix and record exports to the other two regions. Americas net cross-connect adds were the highest we've seen in several years while we experienced negative billing cabinet additions in the quarter largely due to timing of churn. Also in the quarter, we experienced the churn of some lower power density footprints in some of our acquired assets. This occurred a quarter earlier than expected. Americas' billing cabinet additions should return to traditional levels next quarter and we expect a larger step-up in the first half of 2021. After quarter end, we completed our acquisition of 12 Bell Canada data centers and expect to close the remaining asset allocated to this transaction in November, positioning Equinix as a leading digital infrastructure provider in Canada, adding seven new metros and 500 net new customers to sell to across the platform. Our EMEA region saw strong bookings in the quarter with a healthy mix of small deals and new logo adds led by our London and Amsterdam markets. Interconnection was substantially up on a year-over-year basis increasing to 12% of the region's recurring revenues due to both strong volume performance and favorable pricing initiatives. IBX asset utilization remains high and more than half of our major expansion projects are being constructed in the EMEA region including four hyperscale projects related to our EMEA One JV with GIC. And finally, the Asia-Pacific region saw another strong quarter of bookings led by the Singapore and Japan markets. We're seeing early traction with our pending acquisition of GPX India with interest across all of our customer verticals for the Mumbai market. We expect to close the GPX acquisition in Q1 2021. And now looking at our capital structure. Please refer to slide 8. Our balance sheet remains foundational to our future success. We ended the quarter with $2.7 billion of unrestricted cash on the balance sheet. Our total liquidity included our unused revolving line of credit of $4.6 billion. Our net debt leverage ratio remains at 3.3 times our Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA. During the quarter we raised a net $197 million of equity completing our 2018 ATM program at an average price of $777 per share. As we complete this year and head into 2021 and beyond, we intend to enter into a new $1.5 billion ATM equity program, which runs through Q4 of 2023 under which Equinix may offer and sell from time-to-time our common stock for working capital and general corporate purposes. As we've stated before an ATM program is an efficient capital-raising tool that we've used to fund our various business initiatives. And we continue to expect to use a balance of debt and equity to fund our future business needs, and we'll continually seek to maximize the long-term value attributed to our shareholders. Turning to slide 9. For the quarter capital expenditures were approximately $565 million, including recurring CapEx of $38 million. We opened three new projects in the quarter, including our entry into Muscat, Oman creating a second neutral hub along with Dubai for the region's networks and subsea cable traffic. Additionally, we added 50 new projects to our expansion tracking sheet, including our first expansion in Mexico following the Axtel acquisition in Q1, bringing our total significant builds to 41 projects across 25 markets and 18 countries, the result of a very strong customer pipeline. Approximately 75% of our major project spend is going to metros generating over $100 million in annual revenues, where we leverage the established ecosystem density and our installed customer base. And we continue to expand the ownership of land for development, including acquiring land in Bogota\u0301, Frankfurt and Paris. Revenues from owned assets were 56% and we continue to expect this number to improve in the near term. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on slide 10. Our 148 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and generate a 28% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And please refer to slide 11 through 15 for our summary of 2020 guidance and bridges. Do note our guidance includes the anticipated financial results from the Bell Canada acquisition, excluding the Ottawa one facility, which we expect to close in Q4. Starting with revenues. For the full year, we expect revenues to grow 8% on a normalized and constant currency basis, which includes an incremental $39 million compared to the prior guidance through the acquisition of the Bell Canada assets and an expected foreign currency benefit offset in part by Packet revenues being slightly below our prior range and the deferred timing of Equinix custom order work, which we anticipate will move to early next year. MRR churn is expected to be within our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% for Q4. We expect 2020 adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 48%, excluding integration costs an incremental $21 million compared to prior guidance due to the acquisition of the Bell Canada assets and an expected foreign currency benefit. Also we expect to incur $20 million of integration costs in 2020. We're raising our 2020 AFFO, which is now expected to grow between 16% and 17% compared to the previous year through the acquisition of the Bell Canada assets and expected FX benefit and lower interest expense. For 2020, we expect AFFO per share to now grow between 10% and 11%. So, with that, let me stop here and I'll turn the call back to Charles. Sure. Like anything in Q3, I mean you can see that we had just an excellent quarter. And I'd like to say that things generally balance themselves out but in Q3 we tended to have more goodies than we had baddies, if you will. And as a result we meaningfully overperformed relative to our guide. So let me try and put that in perspective for you because it -- so again when you look at the year in totality and you look at the margin for the year, we're right where we want to be and then you add an accretive transaction like Bell Canada. We're very -- we're delighted with what's going on and then throw on top of that currency. But as it relates specifically to the operating cost, there's really three main things that have happened between Q3 and Q4. So let me deal with Q3 first. There's roughly $15 million to $20 million of what I'd call favorables. And that favorable comes in three areas. One, repairs and maintenance was lighter than we had planned and because of that we have costs moving from Q3 where you got benefit into a quarter where we typically do more repairs and maintenance as we moved into Q4. So you have a roughly $11 million swing there quarter-over-quarter. The second one relates to utilities. And again no surprise to, I think many people on the call. Utilities does move around a lot. There's seasonality. But we had basically between one-off rebates and other things we had another sort of $5 million of favorable going through the utility line. And then you flip that into Q4 and we're going in the opposite direction where basically we have some settlements with our indirect power purchase arrangement for our sustainable energy. And so, you're swinging about $10 million there. And then the last thing that happened was effectively, as I said in the prepared remarks when we started the year as you might recall in Q1 we had basically a negative hit to revenues of $3 million and $14 million to EBITDA. At that time we took up a very conservative view on basically what the implications of COVID-19 would be on our business. And because customer collections have been very, very strong we're in a position to release a portion of the reserves that we created. And so we had a six -- I think about $6 million $7 million benefit in Q3. But the flip side is, as we move -- as we deal with COVID and the return to office and one-off payments to employees, we're moving to a negative 4%. So all of a sudden you've got everything going from if I could summarize it sort of a net -- a positive sort of $15 million, $20 million in Q3 to a negative $15 million, $20 million in Q4. And that's why I was very deliberate in my comment that once you get back to Q1 we get -- we return to our seasonal norm, if you will for EBITDA margins.  So again there's a lot of moving pieces a lot of favorability. And quite openly it's -- I think we've got a conservative guide on our Q4 numbers. But if everything went as anticipated that's what you would see. And yet we'd still deliver against our expectations for the year plus the uptick from currency and then Bell Canada. Long-winded response. I apologize for that. And Charles I would just add -- a couple of comments I would just add to what Charles said is number one when Charles made the reference to the fact these aren't deals that we necessarily would have done ourselves having now churned it -- churned those deals what you've actually effectively seen as our MRR per cabinet increase and it's part of the reason for that increase. The second thing that's really important is we are dealing with a mature market. But two points are worthy of note that were in our commentary. Number one, Americas had one of its best quarters ever. So that's another positive. But the interconnection activity continues to be exceedingly strong and that's on a net basis. And so you've got a very healthy ecosystem that's being developed. Then on top of that we're investing around our new products and services. So I only think over some period of time you're going to see an acceleration of that opportunity but you also will see a higher attach rate. And so despite some of the negatives that you see there are some real positives that are coming down the road. The last thing is in my prepared remarks I did make the comment that the Americas has been choppy. It's been choppy for a few years, but we are anticipating a return next quarter to a more normal billing quarter. And then we do anticipate a more meaningful step-up in the first half of next year. And Michael, as it relates to the second question so this quarter we did -- roughly 5.8% of our revenues came from nonrecurring. In fact, that was a meaningful step-up as you note over the prior year and also over the prior quarter. In fact, we actually did a little less than we anticipated. We thought we'd do $4 million to $5 million more this quarter than we actually did here. That all said, I did make a comment that that deferred custom work that we do as a company will likely push into the first part of next year. And I think it's fair to assume for all the different reasons that somewhere between 5.5% and 6% is a reasonable nonrecurring revenue expectation. We'll certainly update that when we give the full annual guide in February. But that's a reasonable assumption to make vis-a\u0300-vis our nonrecurring revenues. And again, it's relatively -- it's 5.8% on average for the year -- it is for the quarter and it's not meaningfully -- it's not a meaningful departure from where we were year-to-date last year. So I think we're about $245 million year-to-date last year. At this point I think we're about $242 million $243 million year-to-date in 2020. So again, I'm comfortable in the 5.5% to sort of 6% range and then we'll update that accordingly. Yes sure. There's a number of things that certainly go on in that particular line. First and foremost, of course, there is the deferred installation revenue that we realize with every sale that we make. And certainly, there's a drag-along effect. For every MRR dollar we -- that we book there's an NRR dollar as well. And so you defer that over basically the relationship of that contract. Then in addition to that, there are -- at times there's goods for resale. There's custom work that we do as well. And think about a large -- perhaps a large hyperscaler or a large customer who's looking for build-out of their environment. And so we do some of that work and we do a fair bit of the work, particularly for the hyperscalers. And as a result, it can be a little bit lumpy. And it'd be custom cabling and installation work for the customer. So effectively they move in put their servers in or their equipment into their racks and they're good to go but we do all the prep work. Again, it's a great line of business for us. It varies in margin return. Again, we use in some cases our own workforce. But that's a line of business that generates roughly 25% to 30% margins. And it appears on the nonrecurring revenue line. You say -- there's certainly the -- take away the seasonal aspects Colby as you know we have the FICA reset in Q1 and we also have our annual sales conference. So, if you put that aside and that's why I wanted to say back to traditional seasonal margins. That has ranged anywhere from 46% to sort of 48% to give you a sense over the last few years. But suffice it to say there absent any investment that we'd make given Charles' comments that is -- you're talking about $15 million to $20 million that would come out of the Q4 numbers. Yes. Charles, do you want me to take those? Or... Okay. Well first and foremost Colby as it relates to the Analyst Day guide the 8% to 10% was a number that we embarked upon again in June of 2018. And as you know, we've done very well against those expectations particularly around AFFO per share again 8% to 10%. There's been a lot of activity. And so we've done a good job of normalizing both for currency and then for the acquisitions. And suffice it to say, we're -- we are a third, well I guess this is our third year into it and we're running ahead of what we originally told the market at that point in time.  As it relates to the next five years, it's probably a little early to give you a sense. But generally speaking, I feel very good about sort of the ranges that we were giving at that time. A lot has changed since then and we'll update you accordingly including some of the acquisitions we've made and we've been very active as a business.  But overall, I feel very good that we can deliver against that profitability target that we set for ourselves vis-a\u0300-vis on a per-share basis to make sure that shareholders recognize the value that we've delivered. I'm sorry... As it relates to COVID again you're right. We basically set a relatively wide range as you know about then we targeted around midpoint. And you can see us starting to peel back some -- there's definitely some impact even as we talk a little bit about the Packet acquisition and just the difficulty on making sure that we could pull that all together as Charles said in a COVID world. That certainly slowed it down a little bit.  But put that aside for a second, I think, overall, the things that we were most worried about is what customers were going to go out of business? What payments were we not going to receive? What were the incremental costs? Certainly as a business again, we said $14 million of cost in Q1 on the EBITDA line. For all intents and purposes, we wrote back $6 million of that in the third quarter and then were going to book another $4 million of new costs in Q4. So net-net you're sort of somewhere in the $10 million to $15 million range on EBITDA. And I would say I feel pretty good about that.  As it relates to the top line, it's hard to quantify. There's certainly some impact from COVID. I think, I'd size it in the $20 million to $30 million range. And here's how we got there. For a number of reasons, we've had very good success in being able to book particularly on the gross line. There absolutely will. There will be some -- there has been some fallout of -- from COVID for companies that have gone out of business and we've made concessions and other things and so we're absorbing that.  But I also think there's been a timing implication. And the timing implication, particularly in Q2 and less on Q3, customers were having difficulties getting to sites and doing deployments and all that. And so the knock-on effect on the revenue line, again our estimate again as we share with our internally and also with our Board is probably at a $20 million to $30 million number. And so that sort of gives you a sense of the ranges that we've absorbed.  Again, we're delighted with where we are vis-a\u0300-vis all the -- what could have been when we first started here in Q1 and started locking things down. Clearly, we've done meaningfully better than we originally anticipated from that original guide. But that's I think because the company has been running exceedingly well and our customers have been paying their bills as they come due absent a few concessions that we'll be making here and there. Thanks Charles. And then -- so I would say that, as it relates generally to the legislative matters that come in front of us particularly around tax, first and foremost as we -- I think we all know Equinix is a REIT, a U.S. REIT and because of that no matter what the outcomes are I think we're not going to pay much in the form of corporate income tax. I don't think that would be a meaningful change. As it relates to some of the propositions though, Charles, I think has highlighted well what our position on the New Jersey, financial transaction tax or the potential for that. Prop 15 in California. Again we have roughly 11 triple-net leases to give you a perspective. We own some of our properties. If it moved forward, Prop 15 moved forward, we would estimate it's not going to be a huge number. But it's probably going to be in the $5 million to $10 million range. That's the -- at least our estimate today of what could be. Again, we're paying very close attention to this. And again, we'll know over the coming quarters, basically on the outcome. And then, we'll update the investors accordingly on the future analyst -- future earnings calls."

            "name": "Charles Meyers",
            "content": "Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. This year has been an exceptionally challenging one, as we all continue to navigate the economic, health and societal changes happening in our world. Despite these challenges, we find Equinix in a unique position to help our customers adapt, respond and accelerate digital transformation, a key priority for business across every sector and a critical driver for economic recovery. With over 10,000 customers cultivating and curating ecosystems that enable digital business remains central to our strategy and has been accelerated by COVID, as businesses shift to operating, selling and expanding online. As we respond to these shifts, we remain focused on driving disciplined growth, extending our global leadership and effectively scaling our business. We are augmenting our capabilities and enhancing our service portfolio in targeted ways to expand our addressable market, responding to evolving customer requirements and ensuring that we remain well positioned for the future. We continue to complement and extend our global platform, both organically and through acquisitions, enhancing cloud and network density and offering our customers the richest range of options to support their adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud as the architecture of choice. Platform Equinix allows our customers to more effectively distribute infrastructure, putting connectivity, data, security and applications where they need them and interconnecting them easily to the cloud, delivering the performance required to service increasingly global digital businesses. In October, we closed the acquisition of Bell Canada's data center portfolio, positioning Equinix as a leading national provider in Canada, while giving Canadian customers the global reach they need. We also announced our long-awaited entry into India, one of the world's largest economies and fastest-growing data center markets, and now the 27th country served by platform Equinix. Once completed, our GPX acquisition will add two highly interconnected data centers in Mumbai and will serve as a critical foundation for Pan-Indian expansion. Our global reach remains as important as ever, combining unparalleled facilities-based coverage with integrated systems, delivery and care. This competitive differentiation continues to drive our business, with revenues from multi-region customers increasing 1% quarter-over-quarter to 74% and revenues from customers across all three regions remaining at a healthy 62%. The Americas continues to lead in exporting business to our other regions, as network, cloud, financial and manufacturing customers take advantage of our reach. We continue to deepen our penetration of the Fortune 500 and Global 2000 and the consistent growth of our top accounts demonstrates the depth of our addressable market and the stability of our business despite the pandemic, with over 90% of our top 50 accounts increasing their business with Equinix quarter-over-quarter. As we grow the business, we are also investing in our future, by making Equinix a place that attracts and inspires diverse talent and making sure that our mission reflects our responsibility to leave our world better than we found it. Equinix was recently recognized as one of the top companies for diverse talent and received the 2020 Green Power Partner award from the U.S. EPA, recognizing our contribution to helping advance the development of the nation's green power market. In September, we issued our first green bond offering as a mechanism to further invest in innovative designs and technologies, meaningfully increasing our efficiency and resource consumption to ensure we continue to operate sustainably and advancing our commitment to reach 100% clean and renewable energy across our portfolio. Turning to the quarter, in Q3, we continued to adapt our selling engine, tapping into a healthy demand environment to deliver another strong bookings performance. These results were driven by continued strength in channel bookings, solid interconnection growth and firm pricing. And the quality and quantity of our pipeline looks strong as we close out the year. We continue to instrument and automate our business to support high deal volumes closing over 4,400 deals in the quarter across more than 3,100 customers with a significant quantity of these orders serviced through digital interfaces giving our business superior predictability and creating a huge opportunity to drive attach rates for interconnection and other incremental services. Turning to our results, as depicted on slide 3, revenues for the third quarter were $1.52 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 11% year-over-year and AFFO was again meaningfully ahead of our expectations. Interconnection revenues grew 15% year-over-year as both unit volume and pricing continued to trend favorably. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. We now have over 386,000 interconnections with 14 of our top metros having ecosystems with over 10,000 interconnections and growing. In Q3, we added an incremental 8,500 interconnects more than the next 15 competitors combined, driven by work from home, video streaming, and enterprise cloud connectivity. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 43% year-over-year with a 7% quarter-over-quarter step-up albeit returning to a more normal revenue growth rate after the surge of capacity buying in the previous quarter. Equinix Fabric also had a great quarter eclipsing the $100 million in annualized run rate with over 2,300 customers fueled by broad-based adoption across all verticals and geographies. As cloud adoption continues to accelerate, we are also making great progress extending our leadership in the cloud ecosystem, capturing new cloud on-ramps and continuing to expand our xScale business. We're seeing strong demand for our assets in our initial European JV and are on track to close our new JV in Japan with GIC in Q4 adding locations in Osaka and Tokyo. We've already signed our first xScale deal in Japan, securing a key anchor tenant who will take the full Phase one capacity of Tokyo 12. And in Q3, we toppled the final domino to give Equinix direct cloud on-ramps for all five of the top clouds across 11 of the metros most critical for global infrastructure deployments: Silicon Valley, D.C., Chicago, Sa\u0303o Paulo, Amsterdam, London, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo, nine more global markets than any other provider. We continue to adapt Platform Equinix to the evolving needs of our customers. And despite the significant challenges of integrating a new team during COVID, we effectively merged our Packet and Equinix road maps and launched our integrated Equinix Metal offering in four global metros with plans for an additional 10 by early 2021. Equinix Metal is a feature-rich and fully automated bare-metal service giving our customers the option to deploy the physical infrastructure of their choice at software speed across our platform, enabling digital leaders to place infrastructure where they need it when they need it. Equinix Metal is also directly integrated into Equinix Fabric helping enterprises quickly interconnect to thousands of networks, enterprises and clouds on Platform Equinix advancing our vision to make Equinix the world's digital infrastructure company. Now, let me cover highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical continues to be a foundation of the platform, achieving its second best bookings driven by carriers expanding capacity for digital business. New wins with local telcos included Airtech Internet, a Latin American fiber Internet provider deploying a network hub to improve peering and performance; and Mint Telecommunications, a British regional network provider deploying infrastructure for increased performance, security and scale. Our financial services vertical had a solid quarter led by EMEA and the insurance subsegment. New wins included a Fortune 500 commercial bank, simplifying their digital ecosystem, as well as expansion with BidFX, a subsidiary of Singapore Exchange Group adding new colocations for its FX trading solutions. Our content and digital media vertical saw particular strength in markets catalyzed by the shift to virtual, including video, social media and gaming. New wins included Rakuten Mobile, selecting Equinix as the foundation to deliver its communication platform to global operators and enterprise customers; as well as an online real estate brokerage, interconnecting to enrich digital experiences for our customers. Our cloud and IT vertical continued to over-index significantly with strength in the Americas and in infrastructure and software sub-segments as adoption of hybrid cloud continues to accelerate. We remain focused on enhancing our market-leading cloud density adding eight cloud on-ramps this quarter alone, and bringing us to 160 direct cloud on-ramps at Equinix, or 42% market share in our metros. Our enterprise vertical had another great quarter with particular strength in health care and manufacturing. New enterprise wins included health care companies Maxor Pharmacy Services; Sandata Technologies; as well as Guardant Health, a leading precision oncology company. Our channel program continues to deliver great results accounting for over 30% of bookings and generating over 60% of all new logos. We had great wins with reseller and alliance partners including Cisco, Microsoft, Oracle, WWT and Zenlayer, across a wide range of industry segments. Channel partners are also contributing to the success of our new market expansions, we're excited to expand our relationship with Bell Canada, as a strategic partner working to deliver industry-leading joint efforts -- joint offers in Canada and globally. This partnership also allows Equinix to engage with Bell resale partners to build stronger relationships across the Canadian channel ecosystem. Other notable wins this quarter included Alestra in our recently acquired Mexican assets for an upscale retail chain and Capgemini in Sa\u0303o Paulo for a Fortune 100 pharma firm, both transitioning from on-premise data centers to hybrid multicloud solutions for elasticity and scale. Now, let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Thanks Keith. We're very pleased with our results this quarter. And as Keith noted, we're immensely grateful to our teams around the world who continue to keep the customer at the center of everything we do and are delivering sustained performance in the business. Even in these uncertain times companies in every sector are embracing digital transformation as a critical business priority and we are uniquely positioned to help our customers scale with agility and create digital advantage. Our consistently strong bookings and healthy interconnection growth give us confidence in the strength of our digital ecosystems and the depth of the addressable market created by broad scale digital transformation. We continue to invest in our strategy, evolving our platform in response to evolving customer needs, expanding our global reach to accelerate digital delivery, committing to a more sustainable future and ensuring that our culture is widely recognized as a place that attracts, embraces, inspires and develops exceptional and diverse talent. So let me stop there, and open it up for questions. Sure. Yes. No I definitely think we're -- I think we're continuing to see enterprise as a very strong sort of vertical for us and cloud -- both cloud and enterprise which are sort of the two sides of the adoption of hybrid and multicloud as the architecture of choice we're seeing that show up both on the supplier side in terms of really strong cloud performance and on the demand side of the ecosystem from enterprise. And so, I think what I've been really pleased with is our ability to continually generate both new logos and enterprise bookings despite COVID. We've adapted I think very well in terms of our selling and marketing engine, overall go-to-market approach in light of, what is now a largely virtual selling cycle. But yes, I think we are seeing enterprise continue to pick up in terms of their adoption of cloud. And I think we're going to be in a good position to continue to invest behind that. I think we're going to look carefully at the productivity of our sales teams and look to continue to add where we think that makes sense. But I think there's a lot of opportunity in front of us in terms of the enterprise opportunity. And if you look at how we're evolving the platform by adding things like Network Edge; continued success with Equinix Fabric which we talked about is a $100 million run rate business now; and then Packet which we now have in market -- in four markets with 10 more coming. I think those are all opportunities to expand the proposition for enterprises. Yes. Great question, Sami. The short answer is, I think, there is a long way to go still. I think a bunch of opportunities are still in front of us. As you've noted you were -- 30% of our bookings coming through the channel, but primarily on a sell-with basis. A lot of success in selling alongside our cloud partners and other technology partners who, I think, have aligned interest on -- sometimes somewhat begrudgingly, but sometimes quite -- in a quite embraced way on hybrid and multicloud as the architecture of choice. But, I think there is a way -- if you really look at it we -- one we probably actually have gone through a pretty normal cycle where we added a lot of partners realized that we weren't probably having that -- it was a smaller subset of them that we're really driving productivity and we've actually gleaned that a bit and more focused on the partners that really make a significant difference in the bookings now. But I think the areas where we have room to go is really finding those partners who have a more sophisticated selling capability and can sell on their own, who can create selling machine then complete this. And then also partners who bring complementary offerings that provide a more complete solution for our customers. And I think we're definitely seeing success and you could see companies like VMware who's a great partner of ours for people who've made big investments in VMware as their tool of -- tools of choice in terms company potential infrastructure within that environment and then sort of marrying that up with the value proposition that Equinix brings both in traditional colo and what we -- they might be doing there, but also with services like the Equinix Metal offering which we just brought to market off the backs of what we acquired with Packet. So I think there's a fair amount of opportunity there in terms of growing the channel and taking it to a new level. Yes. We -- I think we've gotten comfortable with our ability to navigate some of the complexities associated with these things. As you will recall it took us a while get there on the xScale JVs and get them -- sort of, fully work through all the complexities that come with that. But I do think there's opportunity for us to extend that either directly in terms of just additional JVs which we have commented in this script and in others that we're already well underway on discussions in other markets where we think the JV structure will work effectively. And we think that that includes some of the markets that you described. But I also think there's other ways that we kind of think about potentially over time using, \u201cother people's money\" as a point of leverage in terms of getting financial partners who are really excited about the returns that we could offer and that would give us the ability to gain more runway out of our balance sheet and focus our firepower on the high-returning investments that are really down the middle for us. So I do think there's more opportunity for that there. I think the near-term focus is really going to be on additional markets where we would look at JVs and I think you'll be hearing more from that -- more about that from us in the coming quarters. Sure. Keith maybe I'll start and you can add anything that you want there. But look we actually feel very good about the Americas business. We talked about over the last several calls that we expected to sort of return to about a 5% growth rate in the Americas towards the back half of this year and you're seeing that now. As you noted churn was a little bit higher. That was associated Keith actually mentioned that in his script really two larger deployments one that came in a quarter earlier than we thought the other one that was came in as forecasted in terms of churn. But candidly those were both deals that wouldn't have met our commercial hurdle in terms of deals we would have done in terms of our focus on really ecosystem-centric interconnection oriented footprints. And so even though we're seeing some -- we saw a negative billable cabs movement associated with that churn I think as we backfill that with the right kind of business that we're showing we can -- that we can find out there and deliver bookings on, I think we're actually going to get improvement on yields in the facilities that were impacted. So it's definitely a more mature market. We're working hard to continue to drive traction in the enterprise market and seeing good success there. I do think there is organic growth opportunity for us particularly in the enterprise market and also by the way using that selling force to export business to our other regions, which is playing a very, very key role in doing. So I think really that's the quick snapshot in the Americas. And again definitely a more mature market, it has returned to grow pretty nicely. I think we are going to see some of those churns come out that were deals that we wouldn't have really targeted prior. And I think as we stabilize we'll see continued improvements in yield. Sure. You bet. I'll tie those together. Yes, we had previously guided $32 million to $40 million. And I think that we're going to come in a little below that prior range. It's really an artifact of a decision that we made in terms of focusing on -- when we first did the acquisition our belief was that we would kind of let the existing Packet offering run for a period of time and then seek to launch a fully integrated Equinix Metal offer in early 2021. But the response frankly from customers was super positive in terms of our intentions to offer metal as an offering. And they were really encouraging us to bring together the feature set that we envisioned in our -- in the organic product that we had underway when we bought Packet. And so we decided to bring the teams together, but then we waited a bit in terms of we wanted to make sure we had the offering in market before we put the real wood behind the arrow from a sales enablement perspective. And so I think that resulted in us being slightly behind in terms of where we had hoped to be from a bookings and revenue standpoint. But if you look at it in terms of what we expect to deliver in Q4 and what that implies on an annualized run rate, about $30 million, it's really not too far off expectation. And I think the encouragement that we're getting from customers about what they believe is possible with the Equinix Metal offering as we enter new markets over the course of the first half for 2021. I think there's great opportunity there. So, we feel very good about it. We bought that business primarily because of the technology and the team and to really give us some credibility in a market we thought was super additive to our value proposition. And I would say along all three of those dimensions it has been what we hoped for. The team is terrific. We've seen very little turnover in that team. I think they're a great cultural fit. They've come together with our engineering team to really develop I think an Equinix Metal offer that's going to be very successful in the market. And we feel very optimistic about the path forward. You bet. Sure. Keith, maybe I'll take the first one. You can comment on the second one if that works. You can add anything you want on the budget too. But we're kind of well underway on that. We do believe that it's -- and you've heard from us Mike over the years the same old song and dance if you will which is we really think about this as a long-term -- long-term value creation is our objective and we want to maximize the market opportunity and leverage our significant differentiation to do that. And I think that does require that we continue to evolve our service offerings and our platform to be adaptive to what our customers are asking for. And I think that will require investment. But we also have a focus on continuing to drive operating leverage in our business and converting that into margin expansion. And so, we continue to believe that that 50% is an achievable long-term target and we want to drive margin expansion where we can. I think if you look at the operating performance and the sort of EBITDA levels that our mature markets operate at, it's something that we ought to be able to achieve. And we're very focused on trying to make some investments in automation to drive operating leverage. And we'll -- and then we'll trade-off, when we drop that to the bottom line and give margin expansion versus putting that in and doing things like adding additional services to the platform and investing in further automation. So we'll come back to you obviously with more clarity as we align that, but that is the approach that we take and I do think it's going to be a journey still for us. And my -- on balance I would say I believe the opportunity is such that we ought to continue to invest in the business. And I think it would be a mistake for us not to do that. But we also need to make sure that we don't lose sight of the importance of operating leverage. Yes, there's a few of them there. Why don't we -- why don't you go ahead and jump in where you want there and I'll add. Yes. COVID. Let me just add a little color on all of them. One just backing up to the very first question you had in terms of again, just to be clear, I think that what we're saying here is that the Q4 downtick which is apparent in the guide is really a matter of movement between Q3 which obviously significantly over performed on EBITDA that was pulled forward and shift in.  I think if you take that and you sort of adjust for that the movement between quarters, I think you would see a much smoother trajectory and then we would expect that to sort of continue to roll into Q1 with a margin profile that's more consistent with kind of what we typically see. So that's the, I guess, clarification, I'd offer on that one.  In terms of multiyear guide, we're going to come back and obviously provide that in -- hopefully, we'll get back to an Analyst Day here this year and we can offer that. But I do think that we continue to believe that our addressable market opportunity continues to grow. And I think we're going to continue to find a way to invest behind that. And then again on COVID, I think Keith gave the color. But there were a number of hard costs that we continue to see in that. There's definitely trade-offs and there are some things that are better. But we're also putting we've made significant investments in terms of trying to address our employee well-being during this period of time, putting investments in making sure that work from home is a good experience for our employees. And so there's been some hard dollars that have hit that. It's tough to put all of the revenue impacts fully into play -- or into perspective. But overall, I'd got to tell you I think we're extremely happy with how the team has performed despite the pandemic. Yes. Let me jump on the second one first. And give a little bit of color. And then Keith maybe you can take Prop 15. And add any color on sizing potential impacts from the New Jersey thing. But what I would tell you is, yes, obviously we're deeply engaged with our financial trading customers. We have a very healthy ecosystem globally. And certainly New Jersey is an important one. I would tell you that those companies are designed with -- in partnership with Equinix to be highly resilient. And I think that they're going to make it clear that they can move their trading platforms around as they need to. Traditionally that has been in response to a disaster. I think some of them would consider the New Jersey tax a disaster that they would respond to. And I think we just -- and we're there as a partner to support them in terms of, making sure that they can continue to run their business effectively. So I think that it would be -- there would be a potential impact to that. But I think it would be a movement around the ecosystem, I think in terms of being able to re-stabilize that trading volume in other venues. And so, I personally think that -- I think people are -- cooler heads are going to prevail. And I think we will realize that that's probably not a great outcome. And it wouldn't accomplish what people had hoped for. And -- but we're very closely aligned with our trading customers. And I think in a coordinated approach to try to make sure people are thinking clearheaded about that."

At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As we all continue to navigate various health, economic and social changes occurring in our world, our key priorities remain clear, focusing on health, safety and well being of our colleagues, customers and communities, and enabling our customers to respond effectively to the increased urgency of digital transformation as a critical business priority and a driving force in the global economy. Even in the face of an uncertain macro environment created by the global pandemic, the Equinix business continues to perform well, in our relevance in enabling digital business and conductivity remains a core tenet of customer purchasing decisions. In Q2, we delivered the third best gross bookings in our history driven by a record quarter in the Americas continued strength in channel bookings, robust inter connection performance and high volume of small deals. Our expanding go-to-market engine continues to fuel the business generating over 4200 deals in the quarter across more than 3000 customers. And the importance of our global reach continues to shine as our customers scale and expand across the globe, leveraging our platform across 56 metros in 26 countries. We're continuing to increase the scope of customer deployments and customers operating in all three regions now represents 62% of revenue, up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our organic expansions continue opening Hamburg this quarter and adding Bordeaux as a strategic subsea landing location in support of a key hyperscale. And we're using disciplined M&A as a tool to enter new markets and scale our platform. On June 1, we announced our intent to acquire 13 Bell Canada data centers, expanding our coverage in Canada to a national platform and unlocking opportunities for global corporations to capture growth and innovation in the Canadian market. This acquisition which is expected to be immediately accretive upon closing Q4, reflects Equinix has continued commitment to executing platform enhancing acquisitions on financially attractive terms. Before we get into the detail quarter of the results, I want to share a few thoughts on our commitment to social change and our continued work to build a culture and community that can have a meaningful sustainable impact on the future of our society. Recent events in the U.S. have triggered outrage and an outpouring of emotions around the world. We have actively tapped into this energy fostering a rich and inclusive dialogue on the topics of equity and social justice, with a focus on improving our collective understanding of each other and creating a commitment to action, which is imperative to moving us forward positively as individuals, as a company and as a society. While still early in our journey, our vision remains clear for Equinix to be a culture where every employee, every day can truly say I'm safe, I belong and I matter. And for our workforce at all levels to better reflect and represent the communities in which we operate. We acknowledge that we have work to do in achieving this vision but are fully committed to demonstrating measurable, enduring progress against a multi-year strategy and continue to believe that our culture remains a key competitive differentiator. Our approach includes traditional aspects such as diversity targets, bias training and mitigation, community plan the programs and employee mobilization. But we also believe that lasting change will only happen by pushing ourselves even further in our pursuit of becoming a truly equitable and global organization. Our objective is to continue to make our culture a critical competitive advantage, seeking to engage every leader and every employee at Equinix and integrating diversity, inclusion and belonging in every aspect of how we run the business. As a company, we will continue to put in the work and reaffirm our commitment to cultivating a workplace in a society that embraces and vigorously defends equality and diversity. Now turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3 revenues for the second quarter were $1.47 billion up 8% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was at 9% year-over-year and AFFO was again meaningfully ahead of our expectations. Interconnection revenues continue to over index substantially, growing 16% year-over-year, reflecting the important role of interconnection in digital transformation and highlighting our clear market leadership in this area. Unit volume was fueled by growth in provision capacity to support increased traffic and solid new product performance reflecting our ability to meet the evolving connectivity requirements of hybrid and multi-cloud architectures. These growth rates are all in a normalized in constant currency basis. We now have over 378,000 interconnections and we continue to see healthy expansion of our dynamic ecosystems across the globe. In Q2, we add an incremental 8000 interconnects driven by streaming, video conferencing, enterprise cloud connectivity and investments in local aggregation to support work from home. Internet exchange had one of its best quarters ever with peak traffic up 44% year-over-year as the peering community augmented capacity for video conferencing, gaming and over the top video replacing headroom that had been exhausted by COVID related traffic growth. ECX Fabric also had a great quarter, eclipsing 2200 participants and demonstrating robust multi-cloud adoption, particularly from network providers with one-third of them scaling bandwidth to five or more clouds. We're also making good progress in integrating the packet business with strong new logo engagement and continue go-to-market integration as we work to deliver on our vision for platform Equinix to underpin the foundational infrastructure for today's digital leaders. We're also strengthening Equinix's leadership position in the cloud ecosystem through expansion of our hyperscale strategy, allowing us to service both retail and large footprint in key markets. While maximizing the efficiency of our balance sheet through our partnership with GIC. We're seeing strong customer demand in our initial xScale JV in Europe and will soon expand this JV to include our seventh asset Paris 9. This facility is slated to open early next year, it is immediately proximate to our market leading Paris campus and its already 100% pre-leased to a major hyperscaler. We're also tracking to close our new xScale JV in Japan with GIC in q4, adding new locations in Osaka and Tokyo. Now, let me cover highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical achieved record bookings driven by robust reseller activity and network expansion to support traffic growth. Expansions included Colt a global telecom provider adding capacity at the interconnected edge to support increasing user demand, as well as Vocus Communications an Australian specialty fiber and network solution provider deploying infrastructure to increase scale and improve end-user experience. Our financial services vertical heads second highest bookings with strengthen global financial and insurance firms as they accelerate digital transformation. New wins and expansions included a leading Nordic insurance company leveraging hybrid multi-cloud and distributed data and Galileo Financial Technologies, a payment solutions platform rearchitecting their network and securely connecting the ecosystem partners. Our content digital media vertical also saw solid bookings with particular strength in gaming and video, driven by the spike in demand for indoor entertainment. New wins and expansions included IOTA, a leading audience technology platform, looking to expand their footprint to serve the ad tech industry. And Moody's, leveraging ECX Fabric to rearchitect their network and multi-cloud access for increased performance. Our cloud and IT vertical also showed strong bookings led by the infrastructure and software sub-segments with continued momentum and cloud adoption. We continue to extend our market leading cloud density adding 10 cloud on ramps this quarter alone, as cloud providers expand services into new metros including Bogota and Mexico City. New wins and expansions included Cisco extending service capabilities to additional regions to support new product offerings and security and client demand for Cisco WebEx communication solutions, and BMC Software, a leading platform provider of digital workflow solutions, deploying infrastructure to support their expanding customer base across the region. Our enterprise vertical saw solid bookings and broad-based demand with particular growth in business and professional services, government and energy despite some COVID-related friction. COVID continues to shift enterprise spending patterns resulting in increased demand for various cloud-based services including telephony, messaging and conferencing.. New enterprise wins include a Swedish engineering company, optimizing its global network to provide optimal employee experience; the global [spirits] [ph] distributed that switch from building its own on-premise data centers to Equinix to support rapid deployment, as well as Fung Group, a global leader in supply chain solutions leveraging ECX Fabric to digitize its supply chain ecosystem. Our channel program had a record quarter accounting for over 30% of bookings and delivering great productivity from this go-to-market vector. The channel program continues to be a new logo engine for the company generating over 60% of all new logos. We had great wins with reseller and alliance partners including Orange business, Cisco, AT&T, Microsoft and Dell, across a wide range of industry segments, with projects focused on both digital transformation and COVID-19 response. New channel businesses quarter included notable wins with AT&T, for a global insurer transitioning from on-premise data centers to a hybrid multi-cloud solution to enhance elasticity and performance and the Vodafone for a premier global energy company supporting their adoption of SD WAN and hybrid multi-cloud enabling. Now, let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter.\nKeith Taylor: Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. It's nice to speak with you again. Charles and I, hope you and your families are doing well and staying safe. With respect to Equinix the business continues to perform well. Q2 revenues adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share were ahead of expectations despite disruptions experienced by our customers, our suppliers and partners or employees over the past few months. In the quarter we had significant gross PAG and net bookings including very strong net positive pricing actions. Interconnection activity was very healthy, both as a physical and the virtual level. We're making a solid progress across our new edge services products. Our performance scans our key operating metrics was again positive, including solid increases in our MRR per cabinet and global cabinet metrics. For the quarter, we're tracking against our expectations on COVID-19 related impacts and costs. As expected, there are certain cost trends going both directions and will continue to make the appropriate adjustments to our forecast as needed. And as you've heard us say before, but it's certainly worth repeating again, achieving an investment grade rating and now from each of our three credit rating agencies after Moody's May upgrade has proven to be a highly strategic and valuable milestone, enabling us to access the debt capital markets expeditiously, while broadening the investor base and tightening the credit spreads under issued debt. This is particularly important during times of great volatility and disruption like today. In June, we refinanced 2.6 billion of high yield debt at a blended interest rate of 2.07%, the lowest interest rate ever achieved by any triple BBB minus rated issuer. Interest savings on an annualized basis will approximate 50 million and these savings more effectively offset the dilution associated with their $1.27 billion equity raise in May. We have an active construction pipeline with 29 projects underway across 20 markets in 14 countries and we continue to work closely with our suppliers and partners to deliver capacity as close to the target date as possible. Now let me cover the quarterly highlights and note the growth rates in the section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q2 revenues were 1.47 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year, our 70th consecutive quarter of revenue growth including a $3 million net FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. We've seen positive momentum in the first half of the year driven by strong net bookings and price increases, resulting in a healthy recurring revenue uplift but lighter than planned non-recurring revenues due to the timing of custom work and decreased smart hand revenues. Global Q2 adjusted EBITDA was 720 million or 49% of revenues up 6% compared to the prior quarter, and 9% over the same quarter last year, due to strong operating performance and favorable revenue mix, including a $1 million net FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance range. Global Q2 AFFO was 558 million above our expectations on a constant currency basis, largely the result of strong operating performance. We continue to manage the business in support our AFFO per share goals. Turning to our retail highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. EMEA and APAC were the fastest MRR growing regions on a year-over-year normalized basis at 16% and 10%, respectively, followed by the Americas region at 3%. The Americas region saw record gross bookings but healthy pricing and strong exports to the other two regions in the quarter. The Americas growth rate was partially muted by our decision to waive certain smart hand fees and the timing of planned churn. We expect the Americas growth rate to step up in the second half of the year. We also completed the integration of the Mexico assets and won several key internationally based magnets into our network and cloud verticals, as customers start to leverage the value of Equinix platform into our Mexico markets. Our EMEA region saw strong bookings in the quarter particularly across a number of smaller and emerging markets including Dublin and Madrid. Paris continues to perform well and our market networks were seeing an increase in demand and the tightening of supply, a broad build out addition across the region remains active. Interconnection was substantially up on a year-over-year basis driven by volume and pricing initiatives and billing cabinets stepped up in the quarter. And finally, the Asia Pacific region saw another very strong quarter bookings including a record into our Japan markets and the region enjoyed solid exports particularly into EMEA. APAC interconnection had a strong quarter with many providers scaling network connections for future growth but higher than average net adds and cross connects and inter-metro connections. And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. We continue to increase our operating and strategic flexibility through the management of our balance sheet and capital allocation decisions. Pro forma for the debt refinancing activities, we approximately 2.7 billion of unrestricted cash and investments on the balance sheet, our total liquidity, including our available revolving line of credit of almost $5 billion. We will use this liquidity alongside our capital and balance sheet initiatives to opportunistically expand the business, both organically and inorganically, as we work to maximize long-term shareholder value creation including the benefit of the $1.7 billion equity transaction completed in May, our net debt leverage ratio decreased approximately 3.3x in Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA well within our target leverage range. Turning to Slide 9 for quarter capital expenditures were approximately 482 million including recurring CapEx of 30 million. We had seven openings in Amsterdam, Chicago, Dallas, Hamburg, Hong Kong, Toronto and Washington DC. This included the opening of Dallas 11, a new IBX completed on the Infomart Dallas campus, which is an interconnection epicenter and a major hub for the southern U.S. We announced four new expansion projects the majority of these projects to be developed on own land being Bordeaux, Hong Kong, Milan and Warsaw. We continue to expand your ownership acquiring land for development in both Frankfurt and Manchester markets. For the year, we now expect capital expenditures to increase by approximately 150 million, which reflects the anticipated timing of the closing of the Japan joint venture with GIC. Once this transaction closes, GICs portion of the capital expenditure spent prior to the close date will be reimbursed Equinix and amount that is expected to range between $150 million and $200 million, including certain pre-existing current costs. Revenues from owned assets is currently 55%, a metric that we anticipate will increase over the next 18 months. Our capital investments deliver strong returns as shown on Slide 10, 148 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 84% utilized and generate a 28% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested. Please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for our summary of 2020 guidance and bridges, Starting with revenues, we expect to deliver an 8% to 9% growth rate for 2020 a reflection of the continued momentum in the business and includes a net FX benefit of $23 million compared to our prior guidance range. Non-recurring revenues are expected to remain at these levels for the rest of the year. MRR churn is expected to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter for the remainder of the year. We expect 2020 adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 48% excluding integration costs, the result of strong operating leverage in the business including the revenue mix, offset in part by the anticipated investments on a go-to-market and profit organizations and higher than initially planned severance and benefit costs. We expect to incur $20 million of integration cost in 2020 for the integration of our various acquisitions. And when raising our 2020 AFFO, which is expected to now grow between 14% and 18%, compared to previous year. For 2020, we expect AFFO per share to grow between 8% and 12% including the effects of the capital market activities completed in Q2. So, let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thanks, Keith. We're delighted with our Q2 results and are pleased with the continued outperformance of the business a result of our focus on providing customers distinctive and durable value as they embrace digital transformation. Our impact for customers and the financial results that follow as a reflection of the dedication, flexibility and ingenuity of our teams. Over the course of Q2, we like many others had to rapidly adapt our business, adjusting our go-to-market motion of the current realities, evolving operating procedures while maintaining our exceptional service reliability and executing on highly attractive equity and debt deals to enhance liquidity and drive AFFO. Customers remain at the center of everything we do and our customer satisfaction rating moved up the last two quarters to its highest score in the last three years. While we are delighted with how the business is performing, we fully recognize the strain, the shifting challenges and the continued uncertainly we are all facing and as such, we will remain diligent and closely monitoring market dynamics and further adapting our business as appropriate through the back half of the year. The secular drivers of demand for digital infrastructure have never been stronger. And we believe that Equinix is uniquely positioned to execute on the expanding opportunity presented by the accelerating importance of digital transformation and the shift to hybrid and multi-cloud as the architecture of choice. We remain steadfastly focused on evolving our platform to respond to this unparalleled market opportunity. Investing to drive top-line growth, leveraging our operating scale to fuel the AFFO per share growth to our investors and delivering positive impact to our many stakeholders as we continue to build an enduring and sustainable culture and business. So let me stop there and open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTim Long: Wanted to start off with a smaller newer piece of business with packet if I could. Sounds like it's moving along pretty well, just curious, if you can give us an update on how you're moving along with features and the sales force and the channel with the ability to sell the new products? And maybe just a little color with the business that you're doing. Now, if you can give us a sense maybe what kind of customers or applications are being sought out by those to take on this new business for you? Thank you.\nCharles Meyers: Sure, Tim. Thanks. Its Charles. I guess it's important to have backup and continue to put the acquisition of packet into overall context. I think that, as we have talked about on prior calls, this was a way for us to continue to adapt to the changing consumption patterns of our customers in terms of how they want to sort of gain access to the value, if you will, of the Equinix platform. And I think we are adding the bare metal service that packet brings to the table and integrating that with the bare metal service that we had under development organically, we think is really, really represents a big opportunity for us to continue to adapt to those changing needs. The integration is doing well. We've now aligned on a coordinated and integrated roadmap for and coordinate that into a single offering that we will as a company. We continued to integrate the go-to-market motion. And we've actually taken some folks from within the Equinix organization, blended them into the sales team and have that acting as a bit of an overlay today to our larger sales force, still early days there. And I think probably a lot of the customer activity is with some of the more digitally native targets that packet had traditionally been serving. But we're really starting to see a building funnel of enterprise targets, particularly large enterprise targets, as well as some service provider sort of types that are really resonating with the packet opportunity and that offering. So it continues to go well, again -- still very early days. But one of the things that we've been talking about internal as we talked about delivering physical infrastructure and software speed, which has kind of been a rally crier, a tagline that really resonates with us internally and more importantly resonates with our customers. So, again, a product roadmap is well aligned now, the engineering teams are underway on bringing a fully enterprise features set -- the full enterprise feature set to the bare metal offering over the coming quarters and go-to-market motion still relatively early but good momentum in the pipeline.\nTim Long: Okay. In fact, the precursor to a quick follow up you talked about pricing looks like Europe and Asia saw a pretty good MRR per cabinet, ASP growth, could you just give us a little highlight on why you're seeing better pricing there. I'm done. Thank you.\nCharles Meyers: Sure. The key to pricing for us is really continuing, targeted discipline -- discipline in our sales targeting. And we've talked about that for many years now, right, delivering the -- targeting the right customers with the right use cases into the right IBX locations. And I think we're really doing that well in terms of adapting or delivering against the use cases that are really important to customers right now in terms of hybrid multi-cloud implementations, win [rearchitecture] [ph], distributed security, a number of things that are really highly featured, and I think their digital transformation plans. And when you're doing that, I think you're able to deliver outsized value and therefore get good solid pricing. And we're seeing that show up in our yields. So I think and if you look at it, the way our quarter was composed in terms of bookings, we talked about 4200 deals across 3000 customers, that means we're doing a lot of deals, more sort of small to mid size deals, interconnection oriented, ecosystem centric and that really helps us on the pricing front. In Europe in particular, we're also seeing the effects now as a realtor of the interconnection pricing adjustments that we've made. And I think those have gone really well obviously, generally customers don't jump up and applaud when you raise pricing and your services. But I think in this case, our team has done a really good job of articulating the value that people are getting from interconnection. And I also think we've been very measured and kind of appropriate about how we phased those implementations and those price implementations and working with customers. And so that's far it's gone well, we're starting to really see that roll through -- in the impact on the EMEA numbers in particular.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Atkin with RBC. Your line is open.\nJon Atkin: Thanks very much. Two questions. First one probably for Keith. I'm just interested in kind of the medium term margin, puts and takes as we think about where you are in Asia Pac now comfortably past the 50% margin threshold. What are the factors to kind of think about at a corporate level of you getting towards those levels over the next kind of several years? And then I have a follow up on an xScale. Thanks.\nKeith Taylor: Yes. Sure, Jon. I think overall as it relates to margins, as we sort of said in our prepared remarks, we're very pleased with where we are pleased with where we are, pricing actions have certainly been a net positive to us. So that's representative, it sounds very well in our gross profit, or EBITDA and our AFFO margins. All that said, there is a number of things that are going on in the business. One of the things that we did want to surely highlight was we want to continue to invest in our go-to-market and product organization. And this ties nicely back towards Charles, when we talked about with packet. So there's an examples of where we can continue to drive profitability up. I think Q2 was, I don't want to say it's aberrational, because obviously, it's an outcome of many, many great things including revenue mix, where non-recurring revenue came down and recurring revenue went up, and as a result, we got a favorable mix shift, something that we think will continue for the rest of the year. But the other part is, we want to continue to invest in the business and we think we're on track to deliver against our expectation. Again, I'd refer you back to the June 18 Analysts Day, we believe we can deliver 50% EBITDA margins or greater. I don't think that's ever a question for us, doing it with the right discipline and mindset knowing that we want to continue to invest in the business. And right now we just see a very substantial opportunity, not only in the assets we have today, the ones we're acquiring an example being Bell Canada. And so we'll continue to make those investments and the same time, I think we can continually find ways to drive more profitability in the business if we're not investing in our future growth.\nJon Atkin: And then I don't know, Charles, if you would have anything to add to that. But my second question was just on xScale. And I think there have been, maybe some management changes one or two, maybe getting a commentary on that. And it kind of milestones around future JV financings? And then, if you could maybe provide a little bit of color or maybe reminder on the fee structure that you've secured in these agreements, so we can kind of understand more of the impact on AFFO?\nCharles Meyers: Sure, Jon. Yes, maybe I'll make just a couple reiterate, couple of comments on the margin side and just again, say I think we're seeing, as we've talked about the past, we're continuing to try to look at driving operating leverage in the business. I think we're being successful in doing that. And then, again, we're seeing some positive benefits associated with mix of business, mix shift. And then again, that's balanced against the reality that we want to continue to position ourselves to take advantage of what we think is a really big growth opportunity in front of us as hybrid and multi-cloud really plays out. And so we will continue to invest in the business and that will be both on the CapEx side and the OpEx side, which I think will be a bit of a moderating factor on the margins. But I think we can continue kind of up into the right, in terms of over the long haul. Relative to xScale, things continue to really go well, in that overall, we did have some adjustments. Jim Smith has made the decision to step down from his role as Managing Director of the program that does remain as an advisor to the initiative. And we've asked Krupal Raval, who's been on the xScale team now for a period of time and incredible background and we've asked him to step into the MD role. He's done that and really kept the continuity with the team is recruited in there, I think is incredibly strong, very experienced and is really starting to hit their stride. So it's going well, we've talked about in the script that we are probably likely adding or very soon adding the Paris 9 asset that is 100% pre-leased to hyperscaler. And we continue to see good customer interest in pipeline on the other facilities. The JV in Japan has now been announced. We're working towards closing that later in the year. And then, we're looking at additional JV beyond that, so good momentum overall. And then relative to the fees, maybe I'll let Keith comment quickly on kind of how that's structured and impact on the business.\nKeith Taylor: Sure. So, Jon, just as it relates to the fees, there's really full and primary fees. So put aside the equity ownership right now. We're treating the businesses both looks like the Japanese JV will be an equity oriented investment likewise, initial media JV. And so the way it works is, there's basically an asset management fee, a facilities fee, a development fee and sales and marketing fee. And when you break those down, some are recurring revenue, some are non-recurring. And then, the benefit we get from the profitability created by the joint venture that comes in below the line through income from an affiliated entity. So that's how it sort of the fee structure works right now, still pretty early on, as you know, because we've just got the first two assets up. Charles alluded to Paris 9 and having that 100% pre-leased. And we're actively engaged across a number of other assets, both in development and also in the marketing of those assets across the platform. So we're pretty excited about the performance that a group is going to cave to take a leadership role and in this entity, so great progress today.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Your line is open.\nColby Synesael: Just a few. Last quarter, you called out a zero to $50 million headwind to guidance --revenue guidance for COVID-19. I was wondering what the headwind or impact was in the second quarter. And if you still feel that you're going to be within that zero to 50. And maybe you could tighten that up a little bit, if possible at this point. Secondly, your Americas growth, missed our estimate, I think that was probably one of the weaker parts of the quarter. Keith, I know you mentioned the smart hand wave fees. I think there's just a $3 million impact. And on the churn side, when I look at least the cabinet and the interconnects, both those numbers still went up, yet the revenue came down, which seems just more of a pricing impact. So, I'm trying to get a better understanding there. And then, before Katrina kills me, just one last one. Your previous guidance on organic growth was 7% to 9%. You raised it to 8% to 9%. And I believe that excludes that fact that the only change I saw in your guidance was in fact FX, I'm wondering where that extra 1% to 8% of the loan came from. Thank you.\nKeith Taylor: Charles do you want me to take the first part. Just want to make sure because we're in different locations, everybody, so we're just making sure that we're going to organize accordingly. Let me first start off by saying look, we're absolutely delighted Colby with the performance of business for the second quarter. And as you know, when we went into the quarter, we give ourselves a relatively wide range, wide berth from zero to 50 and for this quarter as you know, we basically delivered slightly above the top-end of our guidance range. So said differently then we basically got a lot of flexibility through the second half of the year. And we chose to leave it intact other than FX, very similar to what Charles did last quarter, he made the reference to the fact that we're going to adjust for currency and here's a range of zero to 50. And we're also going to hold absent FX, we're going to hold AFFO, we're going to target a midpoint. Well, when we look at the second half of the year, there's just a lot of uncertainty that still remains -- not too much in our business per se. But the reality of how all of the terminal gets manifested into our results. We let that flexibility inside our guide. And so what you're seeing is not per se specific headwind. On the margin, there's a few adjustments that are affecting us. We have seen pretty larger bad debt reserves than we had before but was planned for. I've made some reference to the fact that there's cost going both directions, clearly our travel and entertainment, or is relatively low -- almost zero. But that offsetting that of course, is our salary and benefits cost, less attrition, less paid time off. And we're doing a very good job of hiring the staff that were slated to be hired. It's our salaries are a little bit higher. So I think that sort of deals with perhaps the majority of the discretion other than the Americas. Americas, as we said, relatively flat this quarter. Colby, you're right there is $3 million of smart hand fees. There's also the impact of the Brazilian currency, fairly substantial segregation to an unhedged currency and then, you've got non-recurring revenues. When you look at it from a pricing perspective, though, MRR per cabinet was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. And so we're delighted with where we are, we allude to the fact of pricing strong, good gross bookings, we have momentum in the business. But you also have some things timing of churn and smart hands, plus non-recurring in Brazil all affecting the results. And that's the benefit we get there for having a very global and diverse set of assets that things are going to move around on a continuous basis, in this case, you're starting to see currency trends moving in our favor. And so, albeit we might be a little bit more susceptible to weaker currencies in the Americas. You're seeing uplift in Asia and in Europe. So let me stop there. Charles, you jump in if there's anything you want to add, or if there's anything you need to clarify.\nCharles Meyers: No. I mean, I think again, I'm on the zero to 50. Obviously, we saw the smart hands impacts across the regions in the quarter as well as, a fairly meaningful impact on our custom MRR and so, but, so the MRR was meaningfully impacted. I think we had a strong recurring revenue quarter bookings were solid. We are seeing some level of friction still out there. But as our results imply the team powered through that and had a good quarter but we have to two sort of big step up quarters remaining in front of us in the back half the year and as we looked at that way and plus I think, very uncertain environment still in terms of sort of second wave, if you will on COVID and the implications of that and how the protracted economic impacts are going to begin to affect companies et cetera. We felt like it was proven to sort of maintain the revenue guidance and just book the FX impacts into there. So that's where we landed.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nFrank Louthan: So talk to us a little bit about more in the Americas. We've talked in the past about what's going on with the Verizon space and how that's going and talk just a little bit about that. And then, follow up thoughts on inorganic growth for the remainder of the year and they've already done one deal clearing not shying away. What are your thoughts on those opportunities? Thanks.\nCharles Meyers: And Frank, I'm sorry, the first one was on Verizon assets.\nFrank Louthan: Yes. The Verizon assets where you are, as far as, fill that that space out to maximize the utilization there.\nCharles Meyers: Yes. Again, it's been a good long time now that we've kind of integrated these. So we tend to think about them all as really part of the platform now. So it's tough for us to think about or even, fully measure that but we are seeing good utilization, obviously made some investments into some of the assets. We actually had some really strong deals this quarter into Miami and Culpeper actually. And so we're seeing good progress on some of the very key assets there. Overall, as we said, I think that the Americas business, we expect that to step up to more like a 5% growth rate in the back half of the year. Again, it was a really solid quarter from a bookings perspective. And so overall, I think, with a start, I think really having worked through the issues on the Verizon portfolio in terms of the churn and things that happened there. And seeing that stabilize I think we're looking at a solid back half of the year for the Americas there. And relative to inorganic, I think that, there are plenty of opportunities out there still. We think that -- we're going to continue to have a posture that -- if you really look at it, our strategy remains unchanged, we have used M&A for market entry for market scaling, for sort of capturing strategic interconnection assets and now for sort of capability additions as we look at the future of platform Equinix and what that means. And I think there are opportunities in all those categories. Obviously, the Canadian deal was really an opportunity for us to really scale in a market and reach national presence in Canada. We think there are some other opportunities, in terms of new market entries that areas that we're continued to be focused on, that are potentially actionable out there. And so, and it's one of the reasons really, that we went and did the equity deal is making sure that we kept some dry powder on the balance sheet to be appropriately opportunistic about growth opportunities that present themselves.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: I was curious if you could delve a bit more into what you're seeing out of the enterprise vertical, in terms of the ability for them to make decisions and the growing interest that they manage team's been describing that you're seeing for hybrid cloud architectures. Thanks.\nCharles Meyers: Sure. Thanks, Mike. Yes, I think that we're seeing a -- there's a few things. One, I do think that we've seen some projects have delayed decision-making, so things pushed out, further in the pipeline. But I think that's been offset to some degree by a broader realization that I think you've heard us and probably many other companies in ours and related spaces, for example, the cloud providers talk about this elevation of awareness around digital transformation and the priority that exists there even in sectors of the economy that are meaningfully impacted by COVID. I think that what people are seeing is that those companies that were better prepared are further ahead in their digital strategies weathering the storm better. And I think that's leading people say we've got to make that investment. In some cases, even if their businesses are a bit on their back, they kind of say, look, we're going to take that medicine, but we're going to invest in the business and in the future, and make sure we're making the digital investments that are necessary. So, that is I think, we are seeing a little bit of sort of both sides of the coin there, which has some delays, particularly new projects that might be delayed just by a variety of factors, including -- taking longer to be able to visit sites, although they are and we are now having tours and visits into the sites on an appointment basis, and so we're sort of freeing up, some of the wheels are turning on that. But there is some of that, if you look at new logos that are a little bit lower than our pre-COVID levels, but we also -- they targeted more at larger accounts with bigger wallet sizes. And so a little bit of a mixed bag, we are on balance, I think, what the enduring phenomenon that we think we're really seeing is this increased commitment to digital and also very much in terms of people saying, look, we still have private infrastructure requirements. We want that private infrastructure over time to be, is probably going to be smaller than what we are doing now. But we need what remains to be immediately proximate to the cloud and deliver both performance and economics in a different way. And we think Equinix really rises to that challenge for them.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMatthew Niknam: Just to if I could, first go back to the last question in terms of sale cycles, any notable delays during the quarter that you'd call out that may have deferred some bookings into the third quarter. And then secondly, on the competitive front, if you can talk about the competitive backdrop in Europe, whether you've seen any changes in the landscape in recent months after some of the recent M&A, larger scale M&A in the region. Thanks.\nKeith Taylor: Sure. As I said, yes, we have, obviously, we've got a very sort of deep command in the pipeline in terms of deals that are in there. We did, there were certainly some opportunities that we had originally, as targeted to close this quarter that pushed out, but that's the case every quarter. Obviously, there's some of that, and but some of those were, you know, that people would chalk up to COVID related sort of delays and decision making. But on balance, when you look at it, you see, our third best gross bookings for quarter ever record in the Americas. Obviously, we've been able to sort of power through some of that and still deliver, strong overall bookings, results. So there's some of that. What we are seeing, I think quite encouragingly is that, those are just delays, they're not cancellations of projects. And at this point, we think it's just a matter of when we're going to bring those opportunities in. So on balance, I think feeling very good and feel like, the team really rallied and delivered an exceptional quarter, given the broader circumstances that we face. In terms of the competitive backdrop, I would say, not a meaningful change, I feel like particularly in, I know, relative to commenting on the sort of post interaction, digital combination in Europe and impact there. I would say it's still very much seems to be in a digestion phase. And I think customers are working to sort of figure out what that means for them. I think employees are of those companies are trying to or now that company are trying to figure out what it means for them. And we're trying to stay focused and deliver and execute effectively while that digestion occurs. And so, I think obviously the performance of our business in EMEA sort of speaks for itself in the quarter. And we continue to as I've always said interaction was always a very credible competitor for us in Europe. And I expect they will continue to be one, but we are right now, I think we're seeing the digestion period and we're trying to take advantage of that while it exists.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimon Flannery: Just coming back to xScale. I think when you were talking about the project, initially, you talked about mid teens type returns. I wonder if you could update us on what -- given you've done some leasing now, you've got a better sense of pipeline and economics. What's your latest thoughts on the return profile on these projects? And just coming back to the enterprises, what's going on the renewal side? What sort of pricing are you achieving on renewals obviously, your pricing commentary has been pretty bullish overall. But, we do see a lot of pressure on IT budgets broadly. And are you seeing any of that coming through in terms of customers trying to get some relief when they renew with you? Thanks.\nCharles Meyers: Sure. Yes. I would say that relative to xScale and return expectations, I would say that, when you look at it, we obviously get some of the benefit, particularly as it relates to our lens on the returns of both fees flowing through as well as the development returns, which give us a bit of a lift on the returns overall and I think will allow us to continue to have those into the double digits. I do think there is some pressure on returns caused by just an overall pricing environment that continues to be aggressive, I think In terms of people competing aggressively for the hyperscale business and that is out there. So I think there's been probably a bit of pressure there. But I think that it continues to be a very attractive return profile, I think both for us and for our partners. And for us, I think being able to do that with relatively limited sort of dry powder off our balance sheet, which we want to allocate to our higher returning retail business. I think that strategy still makes a ton of sense for us. But I would say some, some downward pressure on returns, it will be interesting to see, whether that persists. I do think that, Keith mentioned for example, there are markets where we see supply tightening. And obviously, that tends to improve pricing. But you do have a very powerful set of customers in the hyperscalers that are looking to sort of get the best available terms. So, there's been a bit of downward pressure there. Relative to enterprise renewals, as I said, what we're seeing I think is generally people are continuing to figure out how they can make most effective use of Equinix in pursuing their long-term, hybrid multi-cloud architectures. And so that might mean that people are downsizing sort of elements of their architecture as they move certain applications to cloud. And then, focusing their private infrastructure or the private part of their hybrid cloud into Equinix facilities proximate to the cloud and are still willing to renew those at what we consider to be very attractive rates that are good for us and deliver significant value for the customer. We do see some sawtoothing, which is because we have escalators -- annual escalators built into our contracts virtually across the board. Oftentimes, when you see a renewal, you might see that if you implemented a 3% to 5% annual escalator over say a five year contract that at renewal you may be above market and you may see a sawtoothing of that occur. But that's all sort of part and parcel that are all included in our overall model, which again continues to reflect overall positive net pricing actions, which we think reflects the value that we deliver for customers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nJordan Sadler: So, just wanted to come back to xScale one more time. It does sound like you characterized the overall bookings solid and seeing maybe a little bit of friction because we talked to maybe overall enterprise. Is that also, that characterization pertains the xScale business as well and was Paris 9 leased during the quarter?\nCharles Meyers: Yes. I would say the -- I think the dynamics are a little bit different in that, obviously, we're targeting a much smaller set of customers. And so when you look at the xScale dynamics, I think it's a bit more about where are these hyperscalers are in their expansion, how that matches up relative to a sort of capacity where it's needed, kind of element. And so, if you look at hyperscalers, we're actually, if you look at the performance and results of some of the other companies that are more focused on that, they tend to be lumpy. They have sort of a bit more boom and bust in their quarters based on the timing of sale or timing of bookings and kind of where hyperscalers are in their cycles of expansion. And so, I think the dynamic is a bit different. But yes, the leasing was completed in the quarter for Paris 9. And so we were very pleased to get that done. And we do see a strong pipeline, it just takes -- those are a bit bigger more complex deals with longer sales cycles. And I think the results in any given quarter tend to be a bit lumpier.\nJordan Sadler: Okay. And then just as a follow up, I think you touched on interconnection pricing in Europe, the adjustment that you've made there, where are you in the rollout of those adjustments and what sort of the magnitude of that pricing adjustment?\nCharles Meyers: We're reasonably well advanced. I think that we'll continue to see those adjustments flow through over the course of the next year or so because we try to be fair and balanced and not kind of overly aggressive or greedy about how to -- the timeline on which we wanted to implement those as we tried to -- as we talked to our customers and tried to implement something that we thought was fair and balanced. And so it'll continue, I think through the course of -- the remainder of this year and well into in the next year, I think probably through the course of next year as well. But I think we've probably seen, a good chunk of that probably more than -- well, more than half of that roll through and begin into our results, but there is more work to be done. I think it will be a bit slower as we go through the course of the next several quarters. And in terms of magnitude, I forget what the percentage increase was, it was meaningful and that is showing up in the results. But again, you still are seeing interconnection prevailing pricing in Europe meaningfully below what it is in the Americas and I don't think we will be in a point where we will equalize that, but we are making progress in terms of delivering a pricing that's more consistent with the value delivered to the customer.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nNick Del Deo: First, Keith, I want to drill down a little bit more on the EBITDA, which was pretty meaningful. I think you suggested it was a function of revenue mix. And you said you expect those mixed benefits to continue but your guidance implies lower EBITDA in dollar terms, the next couple of quarters relative to Q2 and margins that are quite a bit lower. Was there anything else besides the mix shift that we should be bearing on in like, power costs or anything along those lines?\nKeith Taylor: Overall, but when we look at the second quarter specifically, we made a comment about price increases across the board. Number one was, good to see ramping, most of that was really focused in the EMEA region. And then offsetting that was non-recurring revenue, you saw the step down to roughly 4.8% of our revenue of non-recurring. And so that comes into different margin profile. So you've got the benefit of those two things happening. So, revenues are roughly at the high end of our guidance range and currency neutral basis, but the mix is favorable. And you saw the benefit of that going to the EBITDA. In addition, we also saw was some moderation in our utility consumption until we got some benefit attached to that. And then, in some of the markets, particularly one I will refer to is Singapore, those making concession due to the current climate. And those concessions come through in a couple of different fashions, is tax abatements, it is rent abatement, in some cases, salary adjustments that is not you don't apply for you allocated and the company was the recipient of certain dollars from the Singaporean government as an example. But overall, I was just saying, we're on top of our numbers, I think the look forward is, as Charles alluded to, it is giving us the flexibility to look at the next two quarters invest in the places that we need to and therefore that's why you see revenues are moving up nicely. But we're also keeping the cost model at roughly 48% pre-integration costs. And that gives you a sense of that we're still spending in the areas go-to-market, new product. The other thing I did, I referred to in one of my prior remarks, salaries and benefits are going up inside the business and that's not because that was something sort of an implication coming out of the pandemic, less people are taking vacation in that and how it gets represented in the financials something that we want to certainly encourage people to do more and more time off. And also just the timing of our hiring, because when you're getting the full quaterization of the hiring, we had a record hiring quarter in Q2, 400 net adds to the business, quarter and that's going to run through the quarter -- the next two quarters as well. Now, last thing, I would say there's some seasonality built into our spent recurring CapEx Q4, more specifically, and that's why you see the impact coming through our guide on the AFFO as well. So overall, we look at on an annual basis, we allocated dollars appropriately, some of it just a little bit more front loaded than originally anticipating, and you'll get the full quarterization impact of it.\nCharles Meyers: Yes. And I guess, I just reiterate the S&B, that's salary and benefits piece of that which is, we are -- one we were seeing lower attrition. I think that partially due to maybe concerns about the pandemic, also, I think it is just a reflection of people, sort of being very excited about where we are and the culture and what the opportunities in front of us are. But I think that's rolling through in ways and we're hiring -- we're moving forward to hiring plans across both go-to-market product technology because we believe the opportunity is really big in front of us. The net impact of that, in terms of is that, we have more cost on the books, and I think that we're kind of calibrating on that in terms of pace of hiring and that kind of thing. But even if we were at the same sort of targeted number of heads, with the attrition being a bit higher, you get some time in there where it takes to rehire and that sort of keeps things a little lower. So we are seeing a little bit of that. And I think that's part of what is impacting that in the back half the year.\nNick Del Deo: Okay, got it. That's great detail. And maybe one quick one on ECX Fabric. I think earlier this year you dropped a node into a partner facility in Belgium. Since first, when you've done like that. Any initial insights into how that's going or updates as to whether we'll see more deals like that.\nCharles Meyers: Still very early days, we have not seen it. And I think it's obviously happened right in the teeth of the pandemic. So, I think probably still too early to tell there. I would say that I think that more broadly speaking, are thinking about how we want to extend the utility and the reach of ECX Fabric, both within our facilities continuing to do our build outs, align the ECX Fabric closely with our packet offering to make a more powerful edge offering in our own facilities. And then, I think also look to potentially position that as something that could be deployed, in non-Equinix facilities. And so I don't know that it would look exactly like what we did in Belgium. But I do think the notion that we would be looking at extending the reach of the ECX Fabric and ensuring that the ability to use the ECX Fabric as a way to plug back in from -- a bit of a further edge back into the ecosystem, in particular, the cloud ecosystem is something that we are absolutely actively looking at. So I do think that's something that we'll be continuing to monitor and look at how to do that over time.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrett Feldman: It's really just a point of clarification. You've talked throughout this call about an outlook for improved revenue growth in the Americas in the back half of year and last quarter, you were talking about growth -- improving to something in the range of 5% or maybe better than 5% as you were getting into the fourth quarter. I think that's still the -- what's embedded in your outlook based on your commentary. But I just want to clarify that you're still targeting that 5%. And then, whether it's 5% or anything, it seems like it's going to be better and I just want to be sure we understand where the momentum is coming from the extent to which it's in MRR as opposed to non-recurring because if it is on the MRR side, it would seem like you have really good momentum into 2021 as well. Thanks.\nCharles Meyers: Keith, you want to take that?\nKeith Taylor: I will take that Charles. So the reference that Charles already said earlier on but in my prepared remarks said the second half of the year and Q3 looks like the quarter that we will achieve that step-up and goes back to your comments. Number one, we saw good pricing, we saw record bookings. We still see some element of churn inside the Americas business for the next few quarters. That all said when we calibrate across the remaining part of the year, we're firmly believe that between the pricing and the momentum of the business, including a strong pipeline, you should see a step up in the growth rates. And that's something that from our perspective, it would carry on into 2021. So early to give guidance on that, but there's no reason why we wouldn't see that momentum continue.\nKatrina Rymill: That concludes our Q2 call. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. Please disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Keith Taylor",
            "content": "Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. It's nice to speak with you again. Charles and I, hope you and your families are doing well and staying safe. With respect to Equinix the business continues to perform well. Q2 revenues adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share were ahead of expectations despite disruptions experienced by our customers, our suppliers and partners or employees over the past few months. In the quarter we had significant gross PAG and net bookings including very strong net positive pricing actions. Interconnection activity was very healthy, both as a physical and the virtual level. We're making a solid progress across our new edge services products. Our performance scans our key operating metrics was again positive, including solid increases in our MRR per cabinet and global cabinet metrics. For the quarter, we're tracking against our expectations on COVID-19 related impacts and costs. As expected, there are certain cost trends going both directions and will continue to make the appropriate adjustments to our forecast as needed. And as you've heard us say before, but it's certainly worth repeating again, achieving an investment grade rating and now from each of our three credit rating agencies after Moody's May upgrade has proven to be a highly strategic and valuable milestone, enabling us to access the debt capital markets expeditiously, while broadening the investor base and tightening the credit spreads under issued debt. This is particularly important during times of great volatility and disruption like today. In June, we refinanced 2.6 billion of high yield debt at a blended interest rate of 2.07%, the lowest interest rate ever achieved by any triple BBB minus rated issuer. Interest savings on an annualized basis will approximate 50 million and these savings more effectively offset the dilution associated with their $1.27 billion equity raise in May. We have an active construction pipeline with 29 projects underway across 20 markets in 14 countries and we continue to work closely with our suppliers and partners to deliver capacity as close to the target date as possible. Now let me cover the quarterly highlights and note the growth rates in the section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q2 revenues were 1.47 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year, our 70th consecutive quarter of revenue growth including a $3 million net FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. We've seen positive momentum in the first half of the year driven by strong net bookings and price increases, resulting in a healthy recurring revenue uplift but lighter than planned non-recurring revenues due to the timing of custom work and decreased smart hand revenues. Global Q2 adjusted EBITDA was 720 million or 49% of revenues up 6% compared to the prior quarter, and 9% over the same quarter last year, due to strong operating performance and favorable revenue mix, including a $1 million net FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance range. Global Q2 AFFO was 558 million above our expectations on a constant currency basis, largely the result of strong operating performance. We continue to manage the business in support our AFFO per share goals. Turning to our retail highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. EMEA and APAC were the fastest MRR growing regions on a year-over-year normalized basis at 16% and 10%, respectively, followed by the Americas region at 3%. The Americas region saw record gross bookings but healthy pricing and strong exports to the other two regions in the quarter. The Americas growth rate was partially muted by our decision to waive certain smart hand fees and the timing of planned churn. We expect the Americas growth rate to step up in the second half of the year. We also completed the integration of the Mexico assets and won several key internationally based magnets into our network and cloud verticals, as customers start to leverage the value of Equinix platform into our Mexico markets. Our EMEA region saw strong bookings in the quarter particularly across a number of smaller and emerging markets including Dublin and Madrid. Paris continues to perform well and our market networks were seeing an increase in demand and the tightening of supply, a broad build out addition across the region remains active. Interconnection was substantially up on a year-over-year basis driven by volume and pricing initiatives and billing cabinets stepped up in the quarter. And finally, the Asia Pacific region saw another very strong quarter bookings including a record into our Japan markets and the region enjoyed solid exports particularly into EMEA. APAC interconnection had a strong quarter with many providers scaling network connections for future growth but higher than average net adds and cross connects and inter-metro connections. And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. We continue to increase our operating and strategic flexibility through the management of our balance sheet and capital allocation decisions. Pro forma for the debt refinancing activities, we approximately 2.7 billion of unrestricted cash and investments on the balance sheet, our total liquidity, including our available revolving line of credit of almost $5 billion. We will use this liquidity alongside our capital and balance sheet initiatives to opportunistically expand the business, both organically and inorganically, as we work to maximize long-term shareholder value creation including the benefit of the $1.7 billion equity transaction completed in May, our net debt leverage ratio decreased approximately 3.3x in Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA well within our target leverage range. Turning to Slide 9 for quarter capital expenditures were approximately 482 million including recurring CapEx of 30 million. We had seven openings in Amsterdam, Chicago, Dallas, Hamburg, Hong Kong, Toronto and Washington DC. This included the opening of Dallas 11, a new IBX completed on the Infomart Dallas campus, which is an interconnection epicenter and a major hub for the southern U.S. We announced four new expansion projects the majority of these projects to be developed on own land being Bordeaux, Hong Kong, Milan and Warsaw. We continue to expand your ownership acquiring land for development in both Frankfurt and Manchester markets. For the year, we now expect capital expenditures to increase by approximately 150 million, which reflects the anticipated timing of the closing of the Japan joint venture with GIC. Once this transaction closes, GICs portion of the capital expenditure spent prior to the close date will be reimbursed Equinix and amount that is expected to range between $150 million and $200 million, including certain pre-existing current costs. Revenues from owned assets is currently 55%, a metric that we anticipate will increase over the next 18 months. Our capital investments deliver strong returns as shown on Slide 10, 148 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 84% utilized and generate a 28% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested. Please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for our summary of 2020 guidance and bridges, Starting with revenues, we expect to deliver an 8% to 9% growth rate for 2020 a reflection of the continued momentum in the business and includes a net FX benefit of $23 million compared to our prior guidance range. Non-recurring revenues are expected to remain at these levels for the rest of the year. MRR churn is expected to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter for the remainder of the year. We expect 2020 adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 48% excluding integration costs, the result of strong operating leverage in the business including the revenue mix, offset in part by the anticipated investments on a go-to-market and profit organizations and higher than initially planned severance and benefit costs. We expect to incur $20 million of integration cost in 2020 for the integration of our various acquisitions. And when raising our 2020 AFFO, which is expected to now grow between 14% and 18%, compared to previous year. For 2020, we expect AFFO per share to grow between 8% and 12% including the effects of the capital market activities completed in Q2. So, let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles. Yes. Sure, Jon. I think overall as it relates to margins, as we sort of said in our prepared remarks, we're very pleased with where we are pleased with where we are, pricing actions have certainly been a net positive to us. So that's representative, it sounds very well in our gross profit, or EBITDA and our AFFO margins. All that said, there is a number of things that are going on in the business. One of the things that we did want to surely highlight was we want to continue to invest in our go-to-market and product organization. And this ties nicely back towards Charles, when we talked about with packet. So there's an examples of where we can continue to drive profitability up. I think Q2 was, I don't want to say it's aberrational, because obviously, it's an outcome of many, many great things including revenue mix, where non-recurring revenue came down and recurring revenue went up, and as a result, we got a favorable mix shift, something that we think will continue for the rest of the year. But the other part is, we want to continue to invest in the business and we think we're on track to deliver against our expectation. Again, I'd refer you back to the June 18 Analysts Day, we believe we can deliver 50% EBITDA margins or greater. I don't think that's ever a question for us, doing it with the right discipline and mindset knowing that we want to continue to invest in the business. And right now we just see a very substantial opportunity, not only in the assets we have today, the ones we're acquiring an example being Bell Canada. And so we'll continue to make those investments and the same time, I think we can continually find ways to drive more profitability in the business if we're not investing in our future growth. Sure. So, Jon, just as it relates to the fees, there's really full and primary fees. So put aside the equity ownership right now. We're treating the businesses both looks like the Japanese JV will be an equity oriented investment likewise, initial media JV. And so the way it works is, there's basically an asset management fee, a facilities fee, a development fee and sales and marketing fee. And when you break those down, some are recurring revenue, some are non-recurring. And then, the benefit we get from the profitability created by the joint venture that comes in below the line through income from an affiliated entity. So that's how it sort of the fee structure works right now, still pretty early on, as you know, because we've just got the first two assets up. Charles alluded to Paris 9 and having that 100% pre-leased. And we're actively engaged across a number of other assets, both in development and also in the marketing of those assets across the platform. So we're pretty excited about the performance that a group is going to cave to take a leadership role and in this entity, so great progress today. Charles do you want me to take the first part. Just want to make sure because we're in different locations, everybody, so we're just making sure that we're going to organize accordingly. Let me first start off by saying look, we're absolutely delighted Colby with the performance of business for the second quarter. And as you know, when we went into the quarter, we give ourselves a relatively wide range, wide berth from zero to 50 and for this quarter as you know, we basically delivered slightly above the top-end of our guidance range. So said differently then we basically got a lot of flexibility through the second half of the year. And we chose to leave it intact other than FX, very similar to what Charles did last quarter, he made the reference to the fact that we're going to adjust for currency and here's a range of zero to 50. And we're also going to hold absent FX, we're going to hold AFFO, we're going to target a midpoint. Well, when we look at the second half of the year, there's just a lot of uncertainty that still remains -- not too much in our business per se. But the reality of how all of the terminal gets manifested into our results. We let that flexibility inside our guide. And so what you're seeing is not per se specific headwind. On the margin, there's a few adjustments that are affecting us. We have seen pretty larger bad debt reserves than we had before but was planned for. I've made some reference to the fact that there's cost going both directions, clearly our travel and entertainment, or is relatively low -- almost zero. But that offsetting that of course, is our salary and benefits cost, less attrition, less paid time off. And we're doing a very good job of hiring the staff that were slated to be hired. It's our salaries are a little bit higher. So I think that sort of deals with perhaps the majority of the discretion other than the Americas. Americas, as we said, relatively flat this quarter. Colby, you're right there is $3 million of smart hand fees. There's also the impact of the Brazilian currency, fairly substantial segregation to an unhedged currency and then, you've got non-recurring revenues. When you look at it from a pricing perspective, though, MRR per cabinet was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. And so we're delighted with where we are, we allude to the fact of pricing strong, good gross bookings, we have momentum in the business. But you also have some things timing of churn and smart hands, plus non-recurring in Brazil all affecting the results. And that's the benefit we get there for having a very global and diverse set of assets that things are going to move around on a continuous basis, in this case, you're starting to see currency trends moving in our favor. And so, albeit we might be a little bit more susceptible to weaker currencies in the Americas. You're seeing uplift in Asia and in Europe. So let me stop there. Charles, you jump in if there's anything you want to add, or if there's anything you need to clarify. Sure. As I said, yes, we have, obviously, we've got a very sort of deep command in the pipeline in terms of deals that are in there. We did, there were certainly some opportunities that we had originally, as targeted to close this quarter that pushed out, but that's the case every quarter. Obviously, there's some of that, and but some of those were, you know, that people would chalk up to COVID related sort of delays and decision making. But on balance, when you look at it, you see, our third best gross bookings for quarter ever record in the Americas. Obviously, we've been able to sort of power through some of that and still deliver, strong overall bookings, results. So there's some of that. What we are seeing, I think quite encouragingly is that, those are just delays, they're not cancellations of projects. And at this point, we think it's just a matter of when we're going to bring those opportunities in. So on balance, I think feeling very good and feel like, the team really rallied and delivered an exceptional quarter, given the broader circumstances that we face. In terms of the competitive backdrop, I would say, not a meaningful change, I feel like particularly in, I know, relative to commenting on the sort of post interaction, digital combination in Europe and impact there. I would say it's still very much seems to be in a digestion phase. And I think customers are working to sort of figure out what that means for them. I think employees are of those companies are trying to or now that company are trying to figure out what it means for them. And we're trying to stay focused and deliver and execute effectively while that digestion occurs. And so, I think obviously the performance of our business in EMEA sort of speaks for itself in the quarter. And we continue to as I've always said interaction was always a very credible competitor for us in Europe. And I expect they will continue to be one, but we are right now, I think we're seeing the digestion period and we're trying to take advantage of that while it exists. Overall, but when we look at the second quarter specifically, we made a comment about price increases across the board. Number one was, good to see ramping, most of that was really focused in the EMEA region. And then offsetting that was non-recurring revenue, you saw the step down to roughly 4.8% of our revenue of non-recurring. And so that comes into different margin profile. So you've got the benefit of those two things happening. So, revenues are roughly at the high end of our guidance range and currency neutral basis, but the mix is favorable. And you saw the benefit of that going to the EBITDA. In addition, we also saw was some moderation in our utility consumption until we got some benefit attached to that. And then, in some of the markets, particularly one I will refer to is Singapore, those making concession due to the current climate. And those concessions come through in a couple of different fashions, is tax abatements, it is rent abatement, in some cases, salary adjustments that is not you don't apply for you allocated and the company was the recipient of certain dollars from the Singaporean government as an example. But overall, I was just saying, we're on top of our numbers, I think the look forward is, as Charles alluded to, it is giving us the flexibility to look at the next two quarters invest in the places that we need to and therefore that's why you see revenues are moving up nicely. But we're also keeping the cost model at roughly 48% pre-integration costs. And that gives you a sense of that we're still spending in the areas go-to-market, new product. The other thing I did, I referred to in one of my prior remarks, salaries and benefits are going up inside the business and that's not because that was something sort of an implication coming out of the pandemic, less people are taking vacation in that and how it gets represented in the financials something that we want to certainly encourage people to do more and more time off. And also just the timing of our hiring, because when you're getting the full quaterization of the hiring, we had a record hiring quarter in Q2, 400 net adds to the business, quarter and that's going to run through the quarter -- the next two quarters as well. Now, last thing, I would say there's some seasonality built into our spent recurring CapEx Q4, more specifically, and that's why you see the impact coming through our guide on the AFFO as well. So overall, we look at on an annual basis, we allocated dollars appropriately, some of it just a little bit more front loaded than originally anticipating, and you'll get the full quarterization impact of it. I will take that Charles. So the reference that Charles already said earlier on but in my prepared remarks said the second half of the year and Q3 looks like the quarter that we will achieve that step-up and goes back to your comments. Number one, we saw good pricing, we saw record bookings. We still see some element of churn inside the Americas business for the next few quarters. That all said when we calibrate across the remaining part of the year, we're firmly believe that between the pricing and the momentum of the business, including a strong pipeline, you should see a step up in the growth rates. And that's something that from our perspective, it would carry on into 2021. So early to give guidance on that, but there's no reason why we wouldn't see that momentum continue."

            "name": "Charles Meyers",
            "content": "Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As we all continue to navigate various health, economic and social changes occurring in our world, our key priorities remain clear, focusing on health, safety and well being of our colleagues, customers and communities, and enabling our customers to respond effectively to the increased urgency of digital transformation as a critical business priority and a driving force in the global economy. Even in the face of an uncertain macro environment created by the global pandemic, the Equinix business continues to perform well, in our relevance in enabling digital business and conductivity remains a core tenet of customer purchasing decisions. In Q2, we delivered the third best gross bookings in our history driven by a record quarter in the Americas continued strength in channel bookings, robust inter connection performance and high volume of small deals. Our expanding go-to-market engine continues to fuel the business generating over 4200 deals in the quarter across more than 3000 customers. And the importance of our global reach continues to shine as our customers scale and expand across the globe, leveraging our platform across 56 metros in 26 countries. We're continuing to increase the scope of customer deployments and customers operating in all three regions now represents 62% of revenue, up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our organic expansions continue opening Hamburg this quarter and adding Bordeaux as a strategic subsea landing location in support of a key hyperscale. And we're using disciplined M&A as a tool to enter new markets and scale our platform. On June 1, we announced our intent to acquire 13 Bell Canada data centers, expanding our coverage in Canada to a national platform and unlocking opportunities for global corporations to capture growth and innovation in the Canadian market. This acquisition which is expected to be immediately accretive upon closing Q4, reflects Equinix has continued commitment to executing platform enhancing acquisitions on financially attractive terms. Before we get into the detail quarter of the results, I want to share a few thoughts on our commitment to social change and our continued work to build a culture and community that can have a meaningful sustainable impact on the future of our society. Recent events in the U.S. have triggered outrage and an outpouring of emotions around the world. We have actively tapped into this energy fostering a rich and inclusive dialogue on the topics of equity and social justice, with a focus on improving our collective understanding of each other and creating a commitment to action, which is imperative to moving us forward positively as individuals, as a company and as a society. While still early in our journey, our vision remains clear for Equinix to be a culture where every employee, every day can truly say I'm safe, I belong and I matter. And for our workforce at all levels to better reflect and represent the communities in which we operate. We acknowledge that we have work to do in achieving this vision but are fully committed to demonstrating measurable, enduring progress against a multi-year strategy and continue to believe that our culture remains a key competitive differentiator. Our approach includes traditional aspects such as diversity targets, bias training and mitigation, community plan the programs and employee mobilization. But we also believe that lasting change will only happen by pushing ourselves even further in our pursuit of becoming a truly equitable and global organization. Our objective is to continue to make our culture a critical competitive advantage, seeking to engage every leader and every employee at Equinix and integrating diversity, inclusion and belonging in every aspect of how we run the business. As a company, we will continue to put in the work and reaffirm our commitment to cultivating a workplace in a society that embraces and vigorously defends equality and diversity. Now turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3 revenues for the second quarter were $1.47 billion up 8% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was at 9% year-over-year and AFFO was again meaningfully ahead of our expectations. Interconnection revenues continue to over index substantially, growing 16% year-over-year, reflecting the important role of interconnection in digital transformation and highlighting our clear market leadership in this area. Unit volume was fueled by growth in provision capacity to support increased traffic and solid new product performance reflecting our ability to meet the evolving connectivity requirements of hybrid and multi-cloud architectures. These growth rates are all in a normalized in constant currency basis. We now have over 378,000 interconnections and we continue to see healthy expansion of our dynamic ecosystems across the globe. In Q2, we add an incremental 8000 interconnects driven by streaming, video conferencing, enterprise cloud connectivity and investments in local aggregation to support work from home. Internet exchange had one of its best quarters ever with peak traffic up 44% year-over-year as the peering community augmented capacity for video conferencing, gaming and over the top video replacing headroom that had been exhausted by COVID related traffic growth. ECX Fabric also had a great quarter, eclipsing 2200 participants and demonstrating robust multi-cloud adoption, particularly from network providers with one-third of them scaling bandwidth to five or more clouds. We're also making good progress in integrating the packet business with strong new logo engagement and continue go-to-market integration as we work to deliver on our vision for platform Equinix to underpin the foundational infrastructure for today's digital leaders. We're also strengthening Equinix's leadership position in the cloud ecosystem through expansion of our hyperscale strategy, allowing us to service both retail and large footprint in key markets. While maximizing the efficiency of our balance sheet through our partnership with GIC. We're seeing strong customer demand in our initial xScale JV in Europe and will soon expand this JV to include our seventh asset Paris 9. This facility is slated to open early next year, it is immediately proximate to our market leading Paris campus and its already 100% pre-leased to a major hyperscaler. We're also tracking to close our new xScale JV in Japan with GIC in q4, adding new locations in Osaka and Tokyo. Now, let me cover highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical achieved record bookings driven by robust reseller activity and network expansion to support traffic growth. Expansions included Colt a global telecom provider adding capacity at the interconnected edge to support increasing user demand, as well as Vocus Communications an Australian specialty fiber and network solution provider deploying infrastructure to increase scale and improve end-user experience. Our financial services vertical heads second highest bookings with strengthen global financial and insurance firms as they accelerate digital transformation. New wins and expansions included a leading Nordic insurance company leveraging hybrid multi-cloud and distributed data and Galileo Financial Technologies, a payment solutions platform rearchitecting their network and securely connecting the ecosystem partners. Our content digital media vertical also saw solid bookings with particular strength in gaming and video, driven by the spike in demand for indoor entertainment. New wins and expansions included IOTA, a leading audience technology platform, looking to expand their footprint to serve the ad tech industry. And Moody's, leveraging ECX Fabric to rearchitect their network and multi-cloud access for increased performance. Our cloud and IT vertical also showed strong bookings led by the infrastructure and software sub-segments with continued momentum and cloud adoption. We continue to extend our market leading cloud density adding 10 cloud on ramps this quarter alone, as cloud providers expand services into new metros including Bogota and Mexico City. New wins and expansions included Cisco extending service capabilities to additional regions to support new product offerings and security and client demand for Cisco WebEx communication solutions, and BMC Software, a leading platform provider of digital workflow solutions, deploying infrastructure to support their expanding customer base across the region. Our enterprise vertical saw solid bookings and broad-based demand with particular growth in business and professional services, government and energy despite some COVID-related friction. COVID continues to shift enterprise spending patterns resulting in increased demand for various cloud-based services including telephony, messaging and conferencing.. New enterprise wins include a Swedish engineering company, optimizing its global network to provide optimal employee experience; the global [spirits] [ph] distributed that switch from building its own on-premise data centers to Equinix to support rapid deployment, as well as Fung Group, a global leader in supply chain solutions leveraging ECX Fabric to digitize its supply chain ecosystem. Our channel program had a record quarter accounting for over 30% of bookings and delivering great productivity from this go-to-market vector. The channel program continues to be a new logo engine for the company generating over 60% of all new logos. We had great wins with reseller and alliance partners including Orange business, Cisco, AT&T, Microsoft and Dell, across a wide range of industry segments, with projects focused on both digital transformation and COVID-19 response. New channel businesses quarter included notable wins with AT&T, for a global insurer transitioning from on-premise data centers to a hybrid multi-cloud solution to enhance elasticity and performance and the Vodafone for a premier global energy company supporting their adoption of SD WAN and hybrid multi-cloud enabling. Now, let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Thanks, Keith. We're delighted with our Q2 results and are pleased with the continued outperformance of the business a result of our focus on providing customers distinctive and durable value as they embrace digital transformation. Our impact for customers and the financial results that follow as a reflection of the dedication, flexibility and ingenuity of our teams. Over the course of Q2, we like many others had to rapidly adapt our business, adjusting our go-to-market motion of the current realities, evolving operating procedures while maintaining our exceptional service reliability and executing on highly attractive equity and debt deals to enhance liquidity and drive AFFO. Customers remain at the center of everything we do and our customer satisfaction rating moved up the last two quarters to its highest score in the last three years. While we are delighted with how the business is performing, we fully recognize the strain, the shifting challenges and the continued uncertainly we are all facing and as such, we will remain diligent and closely monitoring market dynamics and further adapting our business as appropriate through the back half of the year. The secular drivers of demand for digital infrastructure have never been stronger. And we believe that Equinix is uniquely positioned to execute on the expanding opportunity presented by the accelerating importance of digital transformation and the shift to hybrid and multi-cloud as the architecture of choice. We remain steadfastly focused on evolving our platform to respond to this unparalleled market opportunity. Investing to drive top-line growth, leveraging our operating scale to fuel the AFFO per share growth to our investors and delivering positive impact to our many stakeholders as we continue to build an enduring and sustainable culture and business. So let me stop there and open it up for questions. Sure, Tim. Thanks. Its Charles. I guess it's important to have backup and continue to put the acquisition of packet into overall context. I think that, as we have talked about on prior calls, this was a way for us to continue to adapt to the changing consumption patterns of our customers in terms of how they want to sort of gain access to the value, if you will, of the Equinix platform. And I think we are adding the bare metal service that packet brings to the table and integrating that with the bare metal service that we had under development organically, we think is really, really represents a big opportunity for us to continue to adapt to those changing needs. The integration is doing well. We've now aligned on a coordinated and integrated roadmap for and coordinate that into a single offering that we will as a company. We continued to integrate the go-to-market motion. And we've actually taken some folks from within the Equinix organization, blended them into the sales team and have that acting as a bit of an overlay today to our larger sales force, still early days there. And I think probably a lot of the customer activity is with some of the more digitally native targets that packet had traditionally been serving. But we're really starting to see a building funnel of enterprise targets, particularly large enterprise targets, as well as some service provider sort of types that are really resonating with the packet opportunity and that offering. So it continues to go well, again -- still very early days. But one of the things that we've been talking about internal as we talked about delivering physical infrastructure and software speed, which has kind of been a rally crier, a tagline that really resonates with us internally and more importantly resonates with our customers. So, again, a product roadmap is well aligned now, the engineering teams are underway on bringing a fully enterprise features set -- the full enterprise feature set to the bare metal offering over the coming quarters and go-to-market motion still relatively early but good momentum in the pipeline. Sure. The key to pricing for us is really continuing, targeted discipline -- discipline in our sales targeting. And we've talked about that for many years now, right, delivering the -- targeting the right customers with the right use cases into the right IBX locations. And I think we're really doing that well in terms of adapting or delivering against the use cases that are really important to customers right now in terms of hybrid multi-cloud implementations, win [rearchitecture] [ph], distributed security, a number of things that are really highly featured, and I think their digital transformation plans. And when you're doing that, I think you're able to deliver outsized value and therefore get good solid pricing. And we're seeing that show up in our yields. So I think and if you look at it, the way our quarter was composed in terms of bookings, we talked about 4200 deals across 3000 customers, that means we're doing a lot of deals, more sort of small to mid size deals, interconnection oriented, ecosystem centric and that really helps us on the pricing front. In Europe in particular, we're also seeing the effects now as a realtor of the interconnection pricing adjustments that we've made. And I think those have gone really well obviously, generally customers don't jump up and applaud when you raise pricing and your services. But I think in this case, our team has done a really good job of articulating the value that people are getting from interconnection. And I also think we've been very measured and kind of appropriate about how we phased those implementations and those price implementations and working with customers. And so that's far it's gone well, we're starting to really see that roll through -- in the impact on the EMEA numbers in particular. Sure, Jon. Yes, maybe I'll make just a couple reiterate, couple of comments on the margin side and just again, say I think we're seeing, as we've talked about the past, we're continuing to try to look at driving operating leverage in the business. I think we're being successful in doing that. And then, again, we're seeing some positive benefits associated with mix of business, mix shift. And then again, that's balanced against the reality that we want to continue to position ourselves to take advantage of what we think is a really big growth opportunity in front of us as hybrid and multi-cloud really plays out. And so we will continue to invest in the business and that will be both on the CapEx side and the OpEx side, which I think will be a bit of a moderating factor on the margins. But I think we can continue kind of up into the right, in terms of over the long haul. Relative to xScale, things continue to really go well, in that overall, we did have some adjustments. Jim Smith has made the decision to step down from his role as Managing Director of the program that does remain as an advisor to the initiative. And we've asked Krupal Raval, who's been on the xScale team now for a period of time and incredible background and we've asked him to step into the MD role. He's done that and really kept the continuity with the team is recruited in there, I think is incredibly strong, very experienced and is really starting to hit their stride. So it's going well, we've talked about in the script that we are probably likely adding or very soon adding the Paris 9 asset that is 100% pre-leased to hyperscaler. And we continue to see good customer interest in pipeline on the other facilities. The JV in Japan has now been announced. We're working towards closing that later in the year. And then, we're looking at additional JV beyond that, so good momentum overall. And then relative to the fees, maybe I'll let Keith comment quickly on kind of how that's structured and impact on the business. No. I mean, I think again, I'm on the zero to 50. Obviously, we saw the smart hands impacts across the regions in the quarter as well as, a fairly meaningful impact on our custom MRR and so, but, so the MRR was meaningfully impacted. I think we had a strong recurring revenue quarter bookings were solid. We are seeing some level of friction still out there. But as our results imply the team powered through that and had a good quarter but we have to two sort of big step up quarters remaining in front of us in the back half the year and as we looked at that way and plus I think, very uncertain environment still in terms of sort of second wave, if you will on COVID and the implications of that and how the protracted economic impacts are going to begin to affect companies et cetera. We felt like it was proven to sort of maintain the revenue guidance and just book the FX impacts into there. So that's where we landed. And Frank, I'm sorry, the first one was on Verizon assets. Yes. Again, it's been a good long time now that we've kind of integrated these. So we tend to think about them all as really part of the platform now. So it's tough for us to think about or even, fully measure that but we are seeing good utilization, obviously made some investments into some of the assets. We actually had some really strong deals this quarter into Miami and Culpeper actually. And so we're seeing good progress on some of the very key assets there. Overall, as we said, I think that the Americas business, we expect that to step up to more like a 5% growth rate in the back half of the year. Again, it was a really solid quarter from a bookings perspective. And so overall, I think, with a start, I think really having worked through the issues on the Verizon portfolio in terms of the churn and things that happened there. And seeing that stabilize I think we're looking at a solid back half of the year for the Americas there. And relative to inorganic, I think that, there are plenty of opportunities out there still. We think that -- we're going to continue to have a posture that -- if you really look at it, our strategy remains unchanged, we have used M&A for market entry for market scaling, for sort of capturing strategic interconnection assets and now for sort of capability additions as we look at the future of platform Equinix and what that means. And I think there are opportunities in all those categories. Obviously, the Canadian deal was really an opportunity for us to really scale in a market and reach national presence in Canada. We think there are some other opportunities, in terms of new market entries that areas that we're continued to be focused on, that are potentially actionable out there. And so, and it's one of the reasons really, that we went and did the equity deal is making sure that we kept some dry powder on the balance sheet to be appropriately opportunistic about growth opportunities that present themselves. Sure. Thanks, Mike. Yes, I think that we're seeing a -- there's a few things. One, I do think that we've seen some projects have delayed decision-making, so things pushed out, further in the pipeline. But I think that's been offset to some degree by a broader realization that I think you've heard us and probably many other companies in ours and related spaces, for example, the cloud providers talk about this elevation of awareness around digital transformation and the priority that exists there even in sectors of the economy that are meaningfully impacted by COVID. I think that what people are seeing is that those companies that were better prepared are further ahead in their digital strategies weathering the storm better. And I think that's leading people say we've got to make that investment. In some cases, even if their businesses are a bit on their back, they kind of say, look, we're going to take that medicine, but we're going to invest in the business and in the future, and make sure we're making the digital investments that are necessary. So, that is I think, we are seeing a little bit of sort of both sides of the coin there, which has some delays, particularly new projects that might be delayed just by a variety of factors, including -- taking longer to be able to visit sites, although they are and we are now having tours and visits into the sites on an appointment basis, and so we're sort of freeing up, some of the wheels are turning on that. But there is some of that, if you look at new logos that are a little bit lower than our pre-COVID levels, but we also -- they targeted more at larger accounts with bigger wallet sizes. And so a little bit of a mixed bag, we are on balance, I think, what the enduring phenomenon that we think we're really seeing is this increased commitment to digital and also very much in terms of people saying, look, we still have private infrastructure requirements. We want that private infrastructure over time to be, is probably going to be smaller than what we are doing now. But we need what remains to be immediately proximate to the cloud and deliver both performance and economics in a different way. And we think Equinix really rises to that challenge for them. Sure. Yes. I would say that relative to xScale and return expectations, I would say that, when you look at it, we obviously get some of the benefit, particularly as it relates to our lens on the returns of both fees flowing through as well as the development returns, which give us a bit of a lift on the returns overall and I think will allow us to continue to have those into the double digits. I do think there is some pressure on returns caused by just an overall pricing environment that continues to be aggressive, I think In terms of people competing aggressively for the hyperscale business and that is out there. So I think there's been probably a bit of pressure there. But I think that it continues to be a very attractive return profile, I think both for us and for our partners. And for us, I think being able to do that with relatively limited sort of dry powder off our balance sheet, which we want to allocate to our higher returning retail business. I think that strategy still makes a ton of sense for us. But I would say some, some downward pressure on returns, it will be interesting to see, whether that persists. I do think that, Keith mentioned for example, there are markets where we see supply tightening. And obviously, that tends to improve pricing. But you do have a very powerful set of customers in the hyperscalers that are looking to sort of get the best available terms. So, there's been a bit of downward pressure there. Relative to enterprise renewals, as I said, what we're seeing I think is generally people are continuing to figure out how they can make most effective use of Equinix in pursuing their long-term, hybrid multi-cloud architectures. And so that might mean that people are downsizing sort of elements of their architecture as they move certain applications to cloud. And then, focusing their private infrastructure or the private part of their hybrid cloud into Equinix facilities proximate to the cloud and are still willing to renew those at what we consider to be very attractive rates that are good for us and deliver significant value for the customer. We do see some sawtoothing, which is because we have escalators -- annual escalators built into our contracts virtually across the board. Oftentimes, when you see a renewal, you might see that if you implemented a 3% to 5% annual escalator over say a five year contract that at renewal you may be above market and you may see a sawtoothing of that occur. But that's all sort of part and parcel that are all included in our overall model, which again continues to reflect overall positive net pricing actions, which we think reflects the value that we deliver for customers. Yes. I would say the -- I think the dynamics are a little bit different in that, obviously, we're targeting a much smaller set of customers. And so when you look at the xScale dynamics, I think it's a bit more about where are these hyperscalers are in their expansion, how that matches up relative to a sort of capacity where it's needed, kind of element. And so, if you look at hyperscalers, we're actually, if you look at the performance and results of some of the other companies that are more focused on that, they tend to be lumpy. They have sort of a bit more boom and bust in their quarters based on the timing of sale or timing of bookings and kind of where hyperscalers are in their cycles of expansion. And so, I think the dynamic is a bit different. But yes, the leasing was completed in the quarter for Paris 9. And so we were very pleased to get that done. And we do see a strong pipeline, it just takes -- those are a bit bigger more complex deals with longer sales cycles. And I think the results in any given quarter tend to be a bit lumpier. We're reasonably well advanced. I think that we'll continue to see those adjustments flow through over the course of the next year or so because we try to be fair and balanced and not kind of overly aggressive or greedy about how to -- the timeline on which we wanted to implement those as we tried to -- as we talked to our customers and tried to implement something that we thought was fair and balanced. And so it'll continue, I think through the course of -- the remainder of this year and well into in the next year, I think probably through the course of next year as well. But I think we've probably seen, a good chunk of that probably more than -- well, more than half of that roll through and begin into our results, but there is more work to be done. I think it will be a bit slower as we go through the course of the next several quarters. And in terms of magnitude, I forget what the percentage increase was, it was meaningful and that is showing up in the results. But again, you still are seeing interconnection prevailing pricing in Europe meaningfully below what it is in the Americas and I don't think we will be in a point where we will equalize that, but we are making progress in terms of delivering a pricing that's more consistent with the value delivered to the customer. Yes. And I guess, I just reiterate the S&B, that's salary and benefits piece of that which is, we are -- one we were seeing lower attrition. I think that partially due to maybe concerns about the pandemic, also, I think it is just a reflection of people, sort of being very excited about where we are and the culture and what the opportunities in front of us are. But I think that's rolling through in ways and we're hiring -- we're moving forward to hiring plans across both go-to-market product technology because we believe the opportunity is really big in front of us. The net impact of that, in terms of is that, we have more cost on the books, and I think that we're kind of calibrating on that in terms of pace of hiring and that kind of thing. But even if we were at the same sort of targeted number of heads, with the attrition being a bit higher, you get some time in there where it takes to rehire and that sort of keeps things a little lower. So we are seeing a little bit of that. And I think that's part of what is impacting that in the back half the year. Still very early days, we have not seen it. And I think it's obviously happened right in the teeth of the pandemic. So, I think probably still too early to tell there. I would say that I think that more broadly speaking, are thinking about how we want to extend the utility and the reach of ECX Fabric, both within our facilities continuing to do our build outs, align the ECX Fabric closely with our packet offering to make a more powerful edge offering in our own facilities. And then, I think also look to potentially position that as something that could be deployed, in non-Equinix facilities. And so I don't know that it would look exactly like what we did in Belgium. But I do think the notion that we would be looking at extending the reach of the ECX Fabric and ensuring that the ability to use the ECX Fabric as a way to plug back in from -- a bit of a further edge back into the ecosystem, in particular, the cloud ecosystem is something that we are absolutely actively looking at. So I do think that's something that we'll be continuing to monitor and look at how to do that over time. Keith, you want to take that?"

At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thanks Kat. Good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Before we get into the results of the quarter, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the unprecedented times in our world and share our approach to this continuously evolving situation. First and foremost, our hearts go out to all those who have been impacted by COVID-19, and we extend our gratitude to all the frontline workers who are helping to keep us safe and healthy as we navigate this together. From the beginning, we've approached this situation with a consistent set of priorities: protecting the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners; ensuring the availability and continuity of our services that underpin the operation of the digital economy; and stepping up to do our part to mitigate the impacts of this crisis on people and communities around the world. Very early on, we activated our business continuity plans with the goal of ensuring seamless operations through this crisis. I'm incredibly proud of our teams across the company and moved by the care, kindness and courage they are demonstrating each day in service to each other, to our customers and to our communities. As in many other crisis situations through the years, the dedication and professionalism of our operations team has been unwavering, particularly as they were forced to adapt to our policies and procedures to rapidly changing conditions, keeping safety first while ensuring responsiveness to the needs of our customers. Thanks to our global teams, our facilities have remained safe, available and fully operational, and our customer satisfaction scores are at an all-time high. As is often the case, times of crisis reveal fundamental insights about an organization, and COVID-19 is no exception. First, we have seen remarkable resilience of our people and the tremendous strength of our culture. We talk every day about the magic of Equinix. A reference to our culture that might sound light or ephemeral to many, but when a global pandemic puts every aspect of your business and your life into flux, you quickly realize that 10,000 people committed to value like we before me and find a better way is truly a force to be reckoned with. Second, we're seeing a magnification of the role that Equinix plays not only for our customers but in the basic operation of our society. The massive work-from-home experiment in which we find ourselves, has created a spike of near-term demand from a variety of customers, much of which we believe will sustain even as we calibrate on a new normal. And perhaps most importantly, the unique characteristics of this particular crisis have increased the resolve we see from customers relative to their focus on digital transformation as a long-term priority and have highlighted the relevance of Equinix in supporting these efforts. But this crisis has also created a level of distraction and friction in the overall economy that reinforces the importance of the real-time on-demand scalability provided by services like ECX Fabric and Network Edge, and highlights the need for us to continue our efforts to deliver an even more digitally-enabled experience for our customers. And finally, it's times like these where we must stay focused on long-term value creation and maintain the level of commercial discipline that has served us so well for the past decade. We continue to make prudent decisions in the face of our current realities, maintaining the priorities I outlined and ensuring that our balance sheet will sustain us through a wide range of scenarios. These explicit decisions, along with some limited purchase and installation delays, have led us to modestly widen our full year guidance, but we continue to see strong underlying performance of the business with particular vibrancy in our market-leading interconnection franchise, which is rapidly approaching $1 billion run rate business. Our funnel remains healthy with a line of sight to a strong Q2, and we're reaffirming our AFFO guide as a midpoint for the year on a constant currency basis. We are delighted that the Equinix business model continues to be resilient through times of uncertainty enabling us to step-up for our employees, our customers and our communities. While there are undoubtedly many challenges and much uncertainty still in front of us, I've never been more optimistic about the future of Equinix and the magnitude of the opportunity ahead. Now, let me turn to the quarter and the details of our results. We had a great start to the year, delivering strong Q1 bookings, underpinned by a diverse customer demand and robust interconnection growth. Our bookings span more than 3,000 customers, with cross-border bookings up substantially year-over-year. We processed over 4,000 deals in the quarter as our retail go-to-market engine continues to scale in response to our expanding market opportunity. Turning to our results, as depicted on slide three, revenues for the first quarter were $1.4 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 5% year-over-year and AFFO was meaningfully ahead of our expectations. Interconnection revenues grew 15% year-over-year, steadily rising in the last few quarters and a strong reflection of demand across our portfolio of Interconnection products, supporting a variety of customer needs and use cases. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our interconnection portfolio reflects a unique product set that is driving quantifiable customer value. We now have over 370,000 interconnections and delivered our 13th consecutive quarter of adding more interconnections than the rest of the top 10 competitors combined. In Q1, we added an incremental 6,800 interconnections fueled by video streaming and conferencing services and offset by a slight increase in network grooming after a Q4 pause. Peak Internet Exchange traffic grew 44% year-over-year and over 20% quarter-over-quarter, a significant jump driven by work-from-home traffic spikes. Customers are scaling into previously provisioned 100-gig growth capacity and ordering new capacity as we head into Q2. And ECX Fabric continues to be a bright spot with a strong growth in volume and ARPU as higher bandwidth and inter-metro connections become a larger share of the total. In March, we closed our acquisition of bare metal leader Packet, accelerating our ability to deliver physical infrastructure at software speed and enabling both service providers and enterprises to quickly and seamlessly deploy hybrid and multi-cloud architectures. Bare metal is a rapidly emerging category of digital infrastructure that enables businesses to deploy workloads on secure single-tenant hardware distributed geographically to support high levels of application performance and integrate fully with their choice of software and management platforms across a range of vendors. Deploying bare metal as a service on platform Equinix allows companies to accelerate time to market and reduce CapEx while enabling new use cases that require both public cloud and private infrastructure. This is a strategic part of our vision to evolve platform Equinix, interconnecting and integrating global businesses at the digital edge. We're excited to welcome the Packet team on board and are pleased to report that we expect the Packet acquisition to be roughly breakeven in 2020 from a dilution perspective. In April, we also announced our next milestone in our hyperscale strategy, launching a new xScale JV in Japan with GIC, following the success of our initial xScale JV with GIC in Europe. Our xScale approach is a critical element in our strategy amplifying our already deep balance sheet and allowing us to deliver superior returns on invested capital while strengthening Equinix' leadership position in the cloud ecosystem, and leveraging our substantial existing presence and go-to-market strength in major markets around the world. Now, let me cover highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical achieved its third highest bookings, driven by strong network reseller activity as well as meaningful capacity upgrades to support increased bandwidth for work-from-home employees. Expansions included Hurricane Electric, a leading global Internet backbone, utilizing ECX Fabric across 33 locations to allow enterprise customers real-time access to their IP transit offering as well as Reseller Goal Data, a leading America's telecom provider deploying edge nodes in advance of a cable landing station to improve connectivity with Latin America. Our financial services vertical continue to diversify led by APAC and capital market wins. This sector saw healthy new logo adds with meaningful growth in Fortune 500 and Global 2000 customers. New wins and expansions included a Fortune 500 financial services firm re-architecting their network and securely accessing ecosystem partners and a top five global currency exchange tapping into our dense financial services ecosystem across eight locations. Our content digital media vertical saw solid bookings with strength in video and social media. Expansions included Zoom extending coverage and scale to support their explosive market demand as well as TikTok. A top 10 social media platform deploying edge nodes to support coverage and scale of its content delivery platform. Two good examples of COVID-related demand on platform Equinix. Our cloud and IT vertical also saw strong bookings led by APAC and a significant increase in ECX Fabric participants. Expansions included a Fortune 500 security and networking company, deploying infrastructure to support new product offerings worldwide and Link [ph], Japanese IAS MSP deploying infrastructure to support customer experience and ecosystem access. Our enterprise vertical saw healthy bookings despite COVID-related friction in the back half of the quarter reflecting broad strength, including government, healthcare, and education. We continue to focus on helping firms re-architect their infrastructure to solve the challenges of speed, scale and security while enabling the move to next-generation digital platforms. New wins included Phreesia Inc., a U.S. healthcare platform, deploying regional infrastructure to deliver an enhanced customer experience as well as a Brazilian education institution deploying to support digital transformation and improved performance. Our channel program accounted for approximately 30% of bookings, and we continue to see great productivity from this go-to-market vector. We processed over 2,000 channel deals this quarter, our highest ever, with wins across a wide range of industry segments with projects focused on digital transformation efforts as well as COVID-19 response. New channel wins this quarter included a notable win with Verizon for a premier U.S. retailer transitioning from on-premise data centers to a hybrid multi-cloud solution to enhance elasticity and performance, and a joint win with British telecom for a Fortune 150 biopharma firm, deploying a multi-region SD-WAN solution optimized for speed and agility. Now, let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter.\nKeith Taylor: Thank you, Charles and good afternoon to everyone from Burlingame, California. Equinix yet again delivered another very solid quarter of performance. Our success stems from the strength of our teams, who come to work day in and day out to meet the needs of our customers and so many others, including you, our shareholders. We started 2020 well positioned to create significant value for the year and beyond. And right out of the gate, the team delivered as our go-to-market engine yet again produced a solid set of diversified bookings in the quarter. It was our second best Q1 bookings quarter in our history. So, as we sit here today, we firmly believe our platform is not just relevant, but even more essential as the world we know quickly shifts to digital, only accelerated by the opportunities and the challenges created by COVID-19. Our xScale and Packet acquisitions, which both closed in Q1, are tracking well against our early expectations. Also after the quarter end, we entered into our second hyperscale JV for the Japan market, which we expect to close in Q3 and are already looking at our third and other joint ventures for the rest of Asia and elsewhere. And we continue to look for other platform enhancing acquisitions, both targeted and opportunistic. Our inter-region activity remain strong, a reflection that we're selling well across our global platform. We continue to enjoy net positive pricing actions resulting in very firm MRR per cabinet on a currency-neutral basis. And lastly, after funding the two acquisitions this quarter, we have about $1.2 billion of unrestricted cash on our balance sheet and pro forma for our new 364-day facility. We have an incremental $2.5 billion of liquidity to support our global growth and expansion initiatives. We have an active construction pipeline with 32 major projects currently underway across 22 metros in 14 countries. We made a few minor adjustments to our ready for service dates in certain markets, while we continue to work closely with our suppliers and partners to deliver the capacity as close to the target dates as possible with limited impact on our guidance for the year. And we expect another year of active builds and are maintaining our full year capital expansion guidance. As we have said before, we believe the diversity of our business across verticals, sectors, markets and customers, puts us in a highly favorable position to both capitalize on industry trends, but also weather the macro shifts and increased volatility. Specifically, our current revenue exposure to the travel, energy and retail industries is less than 3%. Also, I want to reiterate the importance we place on our employees, our customers and our communities. Let me provide you two examples: We placed certain restrictions on access to our IBXs to protect both our employees and our customers. As a result, in certain circumstances, we're providing three Smart Hands professional services to the affected customers for a period of time. This has a direct impact on our short-term revenues, but is the right thing to do. This adjustment has been reflected in our current financial guidance. Also, our greater than 2,500 IBX employees received a one-time cash bonus to help them address personal needs, given the shelter-in-place requirements in their communities while all other employees were provided a stipend to help support their work-from-home requirements. As a result, for the first quarter, the COVID-19 impact to revenues and adjusted EBITDA was $3 million and $14 million, respectively. On a constant currency basis, and absent the COVID-19 adjustments, both revenues and adjusted EBITDA were above the top end of our guidance range and AFFO and AFFO per share were above our expectations. Now, let me cover the quarterly highlights. Know that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on slide four, global Q1 revenues were $1.445 billion, up 7% over the same quarter last year, our 69th consecutive quarter of revenue growth. Q1 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $15 million negative FX impact due to weaker operating currencies with particular impact on the Euro, the British pound, and the Brazilian real when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $684 million, up 2% compared to the prior quarter and 5% over the same quarter last year, mainly due to strong revenue flow-through from price increases and deal mix. As is typical, we had about $18 million of higher seasonal costs in Q1, primarily attributed to the FICA reset and our annual sales conference. For Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, included a negative $7 million FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q1 AFFO was $535 million, above our expectations on a constant currency basis due to strong operating performance and lower than planned interest expense and income taxes. Our strong operating performance is expected to offset financial impacts related to COVID-19. And as such, as Charles noted, we are reaffirming our AFFO and AFFO per share guidance at midpoint on a constant currency basis. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on slides five through seven. EMEA and APAC were the fastest MRR growing regions on a normalized year-over-year basis at 12% and 9%, respectively, followed by the Americas region at 4%. The Americas region saw its best-ever Q1 price adjusted gross or PAG bookings with a high number of small deals and healthy pricing. Also, as expected, the Americas region continued to export substantial activity to the other two regions, highlighting the value of our global platform and the strength of the Americas selling engine. Bookings included wins with mission-critical digital infrastructure networks and work-from-home service providers. We continue to expect the Americas revenue growth rate to trend upwards to 5% or greater as we progress through 2020. Our EMEA region saw growth across its 22 metros and limited impact from COVID-19. Demand was weighted towards our four largest markets, being Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London, and Paris, with channel activity driving solid bookings into our smaller markets as well. EMEA cabinets billing reduced over the prior quarter due to timing of cabinet installations in both Q4 last year, which was very strong. And delayed installations in Q1 this year, which we expect to be realized in Q2. Deal pricing remained very firm. And Asia-Pacific region saw solid bookings with a record in Hong Kong and a significant uptick in Shanghai. Demand was strong across all verticals with increased need for bandwidth across many organizations, given the extended work-from-home mandates. And now looking at the capital structure, please refer to slide eight. As it relates to our liquidity position, we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of unrestricted cash on the balance sheet with an additional $1.7 billion of unused capacity from our revolving line of credit. Our net debt leverage ratio was 3.9 times at Q1. Annualized adjusted EBITDA up slightly due to the cash used to complete the acquisitions in the quarter. Also, we remain steadfastly committed to driving long-term shareholder value. And we will continue to fund the business from the healthy operating cash flows generated by the business, while also accessing both the debt and equity capital markets as appropriate. Also, note that achieving investment-grade our investment-grade ratings last year has proven to be a highly strategic and an important milestone for Equinix. Despite the recent volatility in the debt markets, we continue to review opportunities to refinance our existing debt tranches on a net present value positive basis. And today, that would not be possible without being investment-grade rated. We do expect to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt over the next 12 months. And note, there is currently no benefit attributed to our debt refinancings in the current AFFO or AFFO per share guidance. Turning to slide nine for the quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $400 million, including seasonally low recurring CapEx of $18 million. We opened two new expansions in the quarter, including a new IBX in Warsaw. And we announced two new expansion projects, one in Frankfurt and the other in Singapore, two of our strongest global markets. We continue to expand our ownership, acquiring land for development in both France and Australia. Also, we recently purchased our S\u00e3o Paulo one IBX. Revenue from owned assets remained at 55%, but we expect this percent to rise by the end of the year. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on slide 10. Our now 148 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Also consistent with prior year, during Q1, we completed the annual refresh of our IBX categorization exercise. Our stabilized asset count increased by net 12 IBXs. These stabilized assets are collectively 84% utilized and generate a 29% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for our summary of 2020 guidance and bridges. Do note, our 2020 guidance includes the financial results from both the xScale and Packet acquisitions. Starting with revenues, we expect to deliver a 7% to 9% growth rate for 2020, a reflection of the continued momentum in the business and includes a negative FX impact of $105 million, net of our FX hedges compared to our prior guidance. Also, we expect revenues attributed to the Packet acquisition for the 10-month period of our ownership to range between $32 million and $40 million. And MRR churn is expected to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter for the year. We expect 2020 adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 48%, excluding integration costs, the result of strong operating leverage in the business, offset in part by the expected higher utilities and property tax expense and a meaningful investment in our go-to-market and product organizations. We expect to incur $20 million of integration costs in 2020, $10 million to integrate Packet and the remaining $10 million to finalize the integration of our various other acquisitions. 2020 AFFO is expected to grow between 11% and 16% compared to the previous year. For 2020, we expect AFFO per share to grow between 8% and 12%, excluding capital market activities. Including capital market activities, we expect AFFO per share to be greater than 8%, consistent with our long-term AFFO per share growth objective, as discussed at our June 2018 Analyst Day. So, let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thanks, Keith. Despite the challenges from COVID, the Equinix business is performing well, and we remain focused on the clear set of priorities we laid out at the beginning of the year; investing in our people; evolving our platform and service portfolio to meet the changing needs of customers; expanding our go-to-market engine to fuel long-term growth; and simplifying our business to drive operating leverage; and enhance our customers' experience. As we continue to navigate an uncertain environment, we will remain diligent, flexible, disciplined, and prepared across the company from how we set up our IBX technician shifts to enhance safety to increasing balance sheet liquidity, investing in new service development and hiring top talent to expand our selling engine, all while closely tracking our financial and operating metrics to ensure profitable growth and maintain a keen focus on AFFO per share as a lighthouse metric for the business. As we have in prior market dislocations, we will manage the business prudently with a long-term orientation and a clear objective to extend our market leadership. As our customers continue to make clear, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach and scale of our platform, the depth of our balance sheet and critically, the passion and resilience of our people will not only enable Equinix to weather the storm, but will position us to execute aggressively on the other side of this unprecedented crisis and capture the massive opportunity that lies ahead. So, let me stop there and open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Phil, please check your mute button, your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Richard for Phil. I just want to get a better sense of the bookings through the quarter. Was it pretty steady? Or did it start to fall off at the end? And what have you seen more recently? And then a quick follow-up on Packet.\nCharles Meyers: Hey Richard. Yes, I think we saw -- definitely saw -- it was quite a normal quarter, I think, for the first couple of months. And then as we as sort of COVID situation became a bit more acute, I think there was uncertainty that created some level of friction. Although, again, we had a really strong quarter across the board generally. But there was, I think, some buying friction in the system, but I would say we entered Q2 with a really healthy pipeline and actually saw strong early conversion of that pipeline in the quarter. And I think right now, we're seeing the early signs of a bit more return to normal and I think what we're also seeing is our selling team really becoming more accustomed to driving sales cycles in this setting. And so overall, we continue to feel good about the bookings productivity of the sales engine.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then with Packet really quickly, it has a pretty wide range. But I guess, looking beyond this year, should we expect more steady growth? Or can we see a bit more of a hockey stick as it kind of scales out?\nCharles Meyers: That's a great question. I do think that we can accelerate growth in that business. It's obviously a relatively small business now. I think there's a meaningful opportunity associated with this kind of bare metal private infrastructure immediately proximate to the public cloud. And by the way, I think it really fits well with kind of what people are seeing and how they're responding to COVID in terms of their desire to be able to deploy infrastructure in a more frictionless way. And so we think as we add enterprise feature set, as we extend our partnerships with the software players and platforms like VMware, Red Hat, et cetera, that people have really invested significantly and that it's going to be a real tool for us as people deploy hybrid and multi-cloud architectures. So, I think that we'll have to reset when we give you a more longer-term guide and talk about that. But I do think there's an opportunity for us to expand growth in that offering. \nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nJon Atkin: Thanks very much. So, two questions. One, kind of high level. Any impacts in Europe that you're seeing from the merger involving interaction? And then a second one for either Keith or Charles. We're kind of now beginning in May and where have things settled out now that we're kind of into COVID on pricing. I took away from Keith's comments that pricing is actually pretty healthy, but where are we kind of settling out in terms of the run rate around cabinet adds and cross-connect adds? Thank you.\nCharles Meyers: Sure. Remind me the first one, Jon, I'm sorry.\nJon Atkin: Europe and any impacts you're noticing from the merger involving the interaction, any opportunities with that--? \nCharles Meyers: Yes, I think we haven't really seen a meaningful change in the competitive environment in Europe, and our demand continues to be strong. I think we're seeing healthy pipeline and healthy bookings as well as strong pricing in the European theater. So, we haven't really seen a meaningful change. We'll continue to monitor that and determine if that's -- if there's any change to that. And then relative to the broader sort of COVID in terms of how it's settling out in cabinet adds and pricing, et cetera. I'll let Keith add here as he wishes. But yes, as we said in the script, I think firm pricing, in particular, in Europe, we're continuing to navigate sort of adjustments in our interconnection pricing very effectively. I mean I think that's given us some nice lift from a price adjusted gross booking standpoint. I think cabinet adds, you saw Europe was a particular oddity caused by basically something that happens every now and then, which is a pull forward from cabinets into Q4 from Q1 and a push out for cabinets out of Q1 into Q2. And so I do think you're going to see -- we saw a very strong Q4, and I think we're going to see a strong Q2. But obviously, we saw a weaker Q1. But I don't think that's a reflection on demand. I just think that's one of the things we've always encouraged you to look at sort of rolling four-quarter averages on cabinet adds. I think cabinet adds are going to be slightly lower, particularly in Europe, maybe as we continue to adjust our mix. Because if you look far enough back, you saw quarters where there were really large cabinet adds in there, associated with hyperscale type deals. We would really prefer, obviously, to direct that business to the xScale JVs and keep our capacity and our capital applied to the very high-return retail business. And so I think that will impact cabinet adds to some degree, but that's fully contemplated kind of how we're guiding in the business, and we think it's going to, again, have favorable impact on other core operating metrics. Keith, anything to add there? \nKeith Taylor: Charles, just further to your comments, I'd make the comment that we saw not only strong pricing in Europe, we saw it across the platform, which is important, Jon, as we think about our business. We talked about the fact that there's net positive pricing actions. Again, it's not just Europe, but again, it's across the platform. And it gives us confidence that we're continuing to see, on a currency-neutral basis. Clearly, there was some currency impact to the metrics which we share in our earnings deck. But overall, we're delighted with what we're doing. And part of what Charles also alluded to and we talked about it, Packet and some of our other service offerings, it is our view that it will continue to add value on a per cabinet basis. I think there's going to be a higher attach rate, and I think interconnection is going to continue to be strong. And all of that sort of lends to a more positive pricing environment for Equinix. \nCharles Meyers: Yes. And I might add -- I might, Jon, have just one more bit of color that kind of bridges between your question and Richard's prior question. What we're finding from a booking standpoint and overall selling productivity is a bit of kind of puts and takes. There's been -- as I said, there was some friction associated with sort of, I think, the near term towards the end of Q1, we're getting back to where people are adjusting, and we're seeing some relief on that. But interestingly and perhaps counterintuitively, we're seeing greater access to decision-makers. Decision-makers are kind of having -- maybe having a different schedule phenomenon, and we seem to be having greater access to decision-makers and seeing a greater resolve on their part to make commitments to move forward aggressively with their digital transformation needs. Now, I think it may mean some delays in some cases, just out of, again, depending on the sector and depending on how acute their other issues might be. But if anything, we're seeing a greater level of resolve in terms of how they're thinking about digital transformation. So, it's a bit of puts and takes. But again, I think we're off to a strong start in Q2 and feeling good about the pipeline.\nJon Atkin: If I can squeeze one in for Keith just on the variability in maintenance CapEx. It was quite significant, and you talked a little bit about that. But what's kind of mix of that bucket? And what's the -- I guess, what were the surprises around that, that what were the normalized levels that you're kind of leading us towards? If you maybe review what makes that up and what's the source of variability of going forward? Thanks.\nKeith Taylor: Sure. Yes. We did see slightly less this quarter than we anticipated, roughly 1.2%. If I go to the same quarter last year, it was 1.5% of revenues. Meaning, certainly, as we're all aware during the latter part of the quarter, things started to slow down a little bit. We also were putting our IBXs into a more restricted fashion. No surprise as things took root in different parts of the world. But all that said, when you look at our overall guidance, we're still looking at somewhere around $150 million to $160 million of capital that will go into recurring and only a portion of that, of course, is maintenance, roughly 2% of our recurring CapEx is maintenance. And so you'll see it go back to a more traditional level in Q2. That's reflected in the guidance. And then for the year, you'll see it. Roughly a little bit lower than we saw last year, but roughly in line with what our expectations would be on a go-forward basis.\nJon Atkin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nFrank Louthan: Great. Thank you. Two questions. One, any of the recent strength coming from business you think might be being pulled forward as customers are kind of grabbing some space, it could impact the back half. And then what do you think the conversion rate will be on virtual cross-connects as you've been doing well with those and as folks are signing those up and then converting them into more permanent facilities. Thanks.\nCharles Meyers: The -- Frank, I'm sorry, I lost the first one again. These double questions are killing me today.\nFrank Louthan: Yes, just any recent strengths that you've seen, do you think any of that's coming from business that might be pulled forward from, say, the back half that could maybe cause a headwind then and--\nCharles Meyers: Yes, I'm sorry. Yes, I don't think so. I think that I think we're seeing that as a response. I think the question of whether or not the demand that is creating that will be sustained over time. I think that's a reasonable question. And -- but I think for the most part, people are generally, they design their networks with a certain amount of headroom where they design their overall delivery systems with a certain amount of headroom. The work-from-home obviously chewed up a lot of that headroom and people had to scramble to add capacity. I think we were incredibly responsive in helping people do that. But I don't think that -- and I think there's some chance that the headroom increases as we moderate more towards a new normal. But I don't think it's going to -- I don't think it will have a huge impact because I think it was more of a burst that we saw there offset to some degree by other factors. And I think we're just kind of going to normalize, hopefully, more so in the back half, again, barring any kind of second wave or any other strange dynamics. So -- and I don't think from a capacity situation, I think most markets were in very good shape, and not worried about parting ways with that capacity in terms of creating constraints in the back half. And as for interconnection, again, I really feel good about the way the business is trending. We were more towards the low end of what we were guiding in terms of total count, but we had a very strong gross adds quarter, the strongest in several years. And -- but we also had some elevated churn associated with some network grooming, both seen 10 to 100 migrations and some consolidation activity in terms of people who are undergoing acquisitions and consolidating networks associated with that. But the virtual cross connection, we think people -- one of the things we talked about in the script is ARPU going up, and that's a real reflection of people buying ports. And then provisioning cross-connects and driving traffic on them in ways that are increasing the ARPU on a per-connection basis. And so we're actually seeing that right in line, if not better, than our physical cross-connects. And so we're really, really pleased with the overall trajectory on the ECX Fabric.\nFrank Louthan: All right, great. Thank you very much.\nCharles Meyers: You bet, Frank.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Rollins from Citi. Your line is now open.\nMichael Rollins: Hi. I have two questions; I'll break it up into two parts. The first one is just thinking about the disclosure that your channel I think, you said was 30% of bookings this quarter. I'm curious, is that what's driving that strength? Is it the enterprise interest in adoption? Are there other things that are driving that up? And what kind of visibility do you get into the pipeline that the channel is looking at versus your own sales force?\nCharles Meyers: Sure. Is that -- was that it? Or do you have another one?\nMichael Rollins: I was just going to ask for a clarification also. When you described the zero to $50 million revenue impact from COVID-19. Earlier in the conversation, I think you mentioned Smart Hand fee waivers. And was curious if that range is only waivers for Smart Hands services? Or are there some other things that were just anticipated in that guidance impact range? Thanks.\nCharles Meyers: Sure. I'll take the first one, and then Keith can comment on the second one, and I'll add as appropriate. So, channel, yes, again, very excited about the momentum we have in channel. And I would say it's largely attributable to the enterprise market, Mike. We -- I think that's where we're really seeing the effectiveness of our channel partners in terms of reaching enterprises with whom they have long-standing relationships, existing contractual vehicles, et cetera. And then also with some of our channel partners, where we're combining our value with theirs to create a full customer solution. And by the way, the hyperscalers fall into that category as well, as they have now seen a very clear sort of signal of the demand for hybrid cloud. If they're seeing a sales cycle being restrained by the need to satisfy the private portion of the hybrid cloud requirement, then they're coming to us, bringing us in and allowing us to help them get that resolved so that they can really satisfy the public cloud demand. And so we see it across a range of channel partners and also across a range of verticals, but really combining our value with that of our partners to solve end customer needs. And in terms of -- but definitely very slanted towards the enterprise. And then in terms of visibility, what I would tell you is that today, we are primarily what I would refer to as a sell with channel. So, we are still in the relatively earlier phases of channel maturity and we're not yet at a point where, generally, people are selling the Equinix value proposition on their own. They're typically engaged with the client, a customer. They engage our sales team. We sell jointly. We comp our direct rep as well as the channel partner, a little bit of cost in there, but really quite modest when you consider it relative to the total customer lifetime value. And so we are getting really good visibility. And of course, they have to register deals to get paid. So, we get really good visibility to the overall funnel on the channel side. So, Keith, I'll let you handle the sort of the discussion on the revenue guide.\nKeith Taylor: Sure. The second question, Mike, the zero to $50 million that Charles commented in his prepared remarks vis-\u00e0-vis the revenues. It's really a reflection. There's a lot going on with the global pandemic, and there has been some uncertainty that's created. Having said that, we had a really strong Q1. Charles alluded to the fact that we have a very, very healthy pipeline, and we've had a great start to Q2. And so we recognize that. All that said is, when we think about the scenario planning, which we and I assume many others are doing, what are the potential implications on the business. And of course, we've thought about different things. Could there be an extension of the book-to-bill cycle? Could there be a weakening of the pipeline? Again, we haven't seen that yet, but these are examples. And hence, as you look forward in understanding what are the overall implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, we sized it of $0 to $50 million. Now, having said that, the first quarter, we've absorbed $3 million already. That $3 million, $2 million of it relates to Smart Hands that we basically in certain cases, with customers will offer free Smart Hand services because of the restrictions that were placed on our IBXs, and then there was a small sales allowance that we put in place. As we look forward, we're going to continue to offer those on a selected basis to certain customers Smart Hands. And therefore, on a go-forward basis, that will continue for some period until we have better clarity on how, if you will, our business and the rest of the businesses around the world will open back up. And then other things that we've thought about are what are the implications on customers on whether we need to make concessions as it relates to invoices that have already been generated, to write-downs to companies that go out of business, and we've reflected all of that. And hence, when you look at the revenue guidance page that we delivered in our earnings deck, you have a pretty good sense of what the scenarios are that we could plan for here. Yet having said all of that, we're going to run the business to deliver against our AFFO target at the midpoint or better. And so that sort of gives you a sense of what we're anticipating. But right now, the most concrete thing I can tell you is that there's selected -- sorry, select cases where we're delivering Smart Hands for free to our customers to certain customers.\nCharles Meyers: Yes. And Mike, I mean, obviously, just it is more than -- that range is impacted by more than just as Smart Hands, as Keith indicated. And it was just argued that given the uncertainty about the depth and duration of exactly what we'll see here, that it was prudent for us to give a -- consider those other items like book-to-bill and some modest level of concessions. And try to size those and say what could that impact be during the course of the year and let's adjust accordingly. But again, we're feeling good about the early start to Q2, feeling good about the discussions we're having with customers, which are quite limited relative to concessions, et cetera. And so we're feeling good about where we're headed.\nMichael Rollins: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. Good evening. I wonder if you could update us a little bit on the xScale progress. How are things going with the initial JV? Nice to see the latest signing here. And then just continuing on the previous theme, you had churn at 2.4, you reiterated the two to 2.5 range. Do you think you're likely to remain at the upper end over the next couple of quarters? Or whether it was that more the onetime items that you were calling out, so you might go back down to where you've been in the last couple of quarters? Thank you.\nCharles Meyers: Sure. So, xScale is going well. I think there's lots of demand. It's a complex business in terms of both the construction side of the business and all that comes with building large-scale projects like that as well as the sort of demand side of the business and dealing with very -- certainly large and important and strategically critical, but also very demanding customers. But the -- I think that they've always demonstrated a strong appetite for us to be satisfying a portion of their large footprint demand. And so we're very engaged with them and seeing a strong pipeline not only for the projects that we already have underway or built out, but for new markets as well. And so very healthy and vigorous dialogue with customers. And as I've always said, it wasn't our -- we aren't planning to be really chase after market share at all costs and hyperscale. Our view is work to generate -- work to win the market demand that we think is critical to cloud ecosystem positioning and we think we're -- we feel like we're being very successful in those conversations. And then obviously, we're very excited about the Japanese JV. We think it's a terrific market. We think we're well-positioned. We think that supply is going to be somewhat scarce and difficult. And we think -- and therefore, we've had a lot of interest in the capacity that we're projecting to bring to market. So I really feel good about that. And again, as Keith indicated, we're underway with additional JV conversations in other parts around the world as well already. Relative to churn, again, we did have some churn that impacted the EMEA cabinet adds and brought us a little bit towards the higher end of the range. But I think two to 2.5 is -- we're just -- we're comfortable in that range. And we, of course, are doing everything we can to manage that towards the bottom end. But I would just reiterate, we're comfortable with that range.\nSimon Flannery: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ari Klein from BMO Capital Market. Your line is now open.\nAri Klein: Thanks. Chuck -- Charles, you mentioned some friction in the enterprise. How challenging is it to add new logos in the current environment? And what are you doing there to kind of help with that? And then some of the -- you mentioned network grooming impacting cross-connect net adds. Was any of that related to COVID? Or is it unrelated?\nCharles Meyers: Sure. Yes, we did see -- we actually had a good quarter on new logos, and we tried to unpack that in terms of was that in the first two-thirds of the quarter and what do we see in the back half. And it was lighter and I would say our bookings from new customers was slightly less than it has, but not in a meaningful -- a particularly material way. I do think it's harder. We're finding that we're having to learn a new set of skills around being able to get an account over the line fully without the physical interaction. But I think we're already seeing that take root. And we've already actually given our sales teams, a number of new tools to be more effective in that setting. And so I think if there is that -- but obviously, there is some level of friction. And I think we just need to be cognizant of that. And that's why when we talked about the bottom end -- widening the bottom end of the range a little bit; it really reflects some of that. And our hope is that we are -- we return to some form of normal sooner rather than later. But even without that, we feel like the sales team can be fairly productive. But there is some level of friction in new logo capture undoubtedly. And then relative to network grooming, it is no, we did not see it as COVID-related. It was associated with some additional 10 to 100 kind of migrations and then also associated with some network consolidation associated with prior acquisitions. And so we saw a little bit of a and it's not atypical. You usually see a slowdown in Q4 because of the sort of network quiet periods. And then you see some of that activity sort of take place in Q1. So, not particularly surprising to us. And as I said, I do think that we're probably at a point now where a lot of the initial bump of 10 to 100 kind of went through with some of the largest players. But there's going to be a continuation of that as -- because the minute it becomes economic for somebody to upgrade electronics based on their route analysis, they're clearly going to do that. So, there's going to be a little bit of that in there, but we feel really comfortable with that sort of $7,000 to $9,000 per quarter guide and the gross adds are particularly encouraging. \nAri Klein: Great. Thank you.\nCharles Meyers: You bet.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Colby Synesael with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nColby Synesael: Great. Thank you. Two follow-up topics. One is related to a question, I think, Jonathan Atkin had asked. When you think about your bookings for the full year in the new environment that we're in versus what you may have thought they are going to be entering the year on January 1st. Do you think with all the puts and takes that you expect bookings to be down, the same, or up today versus what you would have thought on January one for the full year of 2020? And then secondly, as it relates to Rollins' question on the $50 million, I know in the disclosures, you mentioned Remote Hands. But given the number that was in the actual first quarter, I think it was $2 million versus the $50 million, it seems like it's obviously a lot more than that. Am I fair that -- am I correct that you're just really trying to be conservative and give yourself kind of a plug, if you will, for what could be happening, but it's not necessarily something that you're seeing right now and, therefore, actually could potentially be a source of upside as we go through the course of the year. And then lastly, just a housekeeping question. You guys are supposed to have your two-year Analyst Day coming up in June in New York City. Just curious what the expectations there are? Thank you.\nCharles Meyers: Great. Let me comment on the first one, for sure. I'll give you a little bit on the second one, maybe Keith can add in, and then I'll ask Kat to maybe jump in and talk about the status on Analyst Day. But in terms of bookings, as to if we looked at it and said, what's our is our expectation now that it's going to be the same, better or worse than what we would than what we thought be coming into the beginning of the year. Obviously, I think by virtue of the fact that we've widened the bottom end of the range and, therefore, slightly lowered the midpoint on our revenue guide; I think we're indicating that there will be risk balanced towards the downside in terms of bookings and revenue. But that, that risk is actually fairly modest. And so I think that would be the way I would characterize it. Again, we've very strong Q2 strong Q1 bookings, strong Q2 pipeline, where we see signs of sort of friction and some of the factors that were impacting us sort of at the peak of COVID beginning to moderate. And so our hope would be that we -- we'll see that, that risk will dissipate. But I think that's an accurate characterization is that since we lightened the bottom end, we would see a little bit more downside risk from what we had originally planned. But I also think there's opportunities for us to continue to close those gaps during the course of the year, which kind of brings me to the second question, which is, is that all one? Reiterating it is in all Smart Hands, it's a portion of that. If you -- as Keith said, a couple of million made in the quarter. But obviously, it was a relatively short stub period. Should that occur throughout Q2, Q3, and Q4, we would see, obviously, more than that, which would contribute to a meaningful portion of that $50 million but then there's other things in terms of potential book-to-bill delays, concessions and sales reserves, et cetera, that might also impact that. And so I think it was our best judgment about how to reflect what we thought the risks were by opening up the bottom end slightly and leaving the top end. In that if things mitigate quickly, we get back to a more normal environment that -- and the business continues to perform well even in this environment, that we think we can close those gaps. So, that's kind of what I would say. Keith, I don't know if you have anything to add on that second topic?\nKeith Taylor: I think it's well said, Charles. Thanks.\nKatrina Rymill: And then, Colby, to your question on Analyst Day on -- so as you can appreciate, given that all is going on, we will be moving our Analyst Day back. We absolutely love hosting our investors out of New York. We typically host a very large event, but given COVID, we will have to push back. In the meantime, Chip and I are going to be increasing the amount of reach outs all virtually, but were aimed to increase amount of conferences, the times and engagements, and looking forward to having a very active May and June with our investor base.\nColby Synesael: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.\nJordan Sadler: Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on a couple of other questions or topics that have been discussed. First, regarding concessions and/or collections looking into April, either with regard to the $50 million or otherwise. The have you seen or have any requests from some of your customers? And can you quantify either number of requests or percent of rent reflected by those requests to date? And then separately, just touching back on the book-to-bill. What -- can you quantify maybe any delays that you've seen as a result of COVID or as a result of the lockdowns related to COVID, directly as it relates to book-to-bill? And then coming back to the churn, specifically in EMEA, what was that attributable to specifically, if you could add a little bit more color? And then on the timing in the quarter, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nCharles Meyers: Sure. That's a lot, but I wrote it down this time and I make a note so I can remember it. Keith, maybe you can start with the first pieces there on concessions and collections, et cetera.\nKeith Taylor: Sure. Jordan, as you can appreciate, still pretty early in the process. As we've referred to, it was really the latter half of the quarter where we start to feel the more larger impact to the pandemic. Having said all of that, our Q1, when we reported out, our DSOs actually improved, particularly in Europe and particularly for those extended terms. And so our DSOs dropped one full day to 42 days. So it gives you a sense that our collections continue to be very strong. You'll see in our 10-Q that we report that are actually our even though our revenues went up, our accounts receivable went down quarter-over-quarter. So that gives you a sense really that right now, we don't see it as an issue. As we look into April, we still don't see it as an issue. And now that we've closed April, but we have a pretty good idea on how we're coming in, in April. And as Charles and I have both alluded to, we feel pretty good about the first month of the new quarter. As it relates to concessions, absolutely, there are customers out there that have asked for concessions. But do remember, our top 50 customers represent 40% of our business, and you know who our top customers are. And so it will be at the far end of the tail, typically that customers will be asking for some type of concession. I to be honest, I don't have the visibility given that it just hasn't amounted to anything significant at that point at this point in time. But we are assuming that there will be customers who will eventually ask for concessions or who already have asked for concessions. Just like you're hearing out in the marketplace from our peers and other like industries. So why don't I stop there, let me pass it back to you, Charles, just on the--\nCharles Meyers: Yes. And then maybe on the -- you like to ask for a little maybe more specifics on the book-to-bill. We do see occasionally, some people saying, hey, we were scheduled to implement this and begin billing on this commencement date. Obviously, we're not comfortable having our teams out there to finish that deployment. We'd like to push that out a bit. And so I think there is some of that, again, fairly limited in the grand scheme of things, but I think those are the types of things that we think we -- and we do see some of those. And we're accommodating those requests because we think that's the right thing to do given the situations. But there's a relatively small number of those. And then relative to the churn and EMEA, there was some large footprint churn. I think it's pretty -- it would be pretty typical indicative of it. As I said in our -- in my prepared comments, maintaining our commercial discipline, continuing these were really larger footprint deals, lower-yielding returns on capital and the kind of things where you do continue to see people re-architect towards different solutions. And so nothing particularly surprising there, but a couple that hit in the quarter and caused both a reduction in -- or an increase in churn and a reduction in cabinet adds. But of course, those cabinets go right back into the hopper. And we intend to resell them at a significantly higher price point and margin profile, given what is a really favorable trend on mix of business in EMEA.\nJordan Sadler: Thank you.\nCharles Meyers: You bet.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Erik Rasmussen from Stifel. Your line is now open.\nErik Rasmussen: Yes, thank you very much. I'll keep it brief then. Just on the JV announcement for your xScale data center built in Japan, can you just comment on how you see this changes your opportunities across the region and your market position? And then with that, who do you see as your biggest competitors in the region? And then just the follow-up there would be, I know you've been focused on international markets, but at what point do you see the U.S. becoming more interesting? Thanks.\nCharles Meyers: Yes. I mean, we feel really good. I would say that the -- look, we view ourselves very much as a global platform. And so continuing to extend the strength our strength in key markets around the world and being able to meet a more comprehensive set of our customers' needs across a variety of solution requirements, including the very large footprint, just we think increases our overall global position, not obviously, in market, in Japan, and we think that, as I said, I think given what we see as potential supply constraints in that market and what others customers are seeing as potential supply constraints, we feel really good about our ability to generate utilization and bookings and, therefore, strong returns from our Japan JV. But it is part of a much bigger picture. We have an incredible business in APAC. Being able to serve customers in the primary sort of APAC markets that they're looking to deploy and is a key part of our strategy, and we're excited about the overall trajectory there. And then in terms of the U.S., looking more interesting. Again, I think it continues to be a very highly competitive market with some markets like in Ashburn, for example, at the large footprint end of the spectrum being, I think, in an imbalanced supply and demand situation, which is highly pressuring prices, et cetera. We feel very fortunate that we maintain a very different franchise in Ashburn and have seen tremendous health and strong price durability in our Ashburn -- in our business in Ashburn. But I think our appetite in the U.S. will be more limited for sure. Although I do think that we look at a campus like Dallas with having the potential to add large footprint capacity in immediate proximity to the Infomart, that is a very unique proposition that we would sort of resonate with. So -- but we're going to be very selective there just because we think there's other better opportunities for us around the world.\nErik Rasmussen: Okay. Thank you.\nCharles Meyers: You bet.\nOperator: That concludes our Q1 call. Thank you for joining us.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Keith Taylor",
            "content": "Thank you, Charles and good afternoon to everyone from Burlingame, California. Equinix yet again delivered another very solid quarter of performance. Our success stems from the strength of our teams, who come to work day in and day out to meet the needs of our customers and so many others, including you, our shareholders. We started 2020 well positioned to create significant value for the year and beyond. And right out of the gate, the team delivered as our go-to-market engine yet again produced a solid set of diversified bookings in the quarter. It was our second best Q1 bookings quarter in our history. So, as we sit here today, we firmly believe our platform is not just relevant, but even more essential as the world we know quickly shifts to digital, only accelerated by the opportunities and the challenges created by COVID-19. Our xScale and Packet acquisitions, which both closed in Q1, are tracking well against our early expectations. Also after the quarter end, we entered into our second hyperscale JV for the Japan market, which we expect to close in Q3 and are already looking at our third and other joint ventures for the rest of Asia and elsewhere. And we continue to look for other platform enhancing acquisitions, both targeted and opportunistic. Our inter-region activity remain strong, a reflection that we're selling well across our global platform. We continue to enjoy net positive pricing actions resulting in very firm MRR per cabinet on a currency-neutral basis. And lastly, after funding the two acquisitions this quarter, we have about $1.2 billion of unrestricted cash on our balance sheet and pro forma for our new 364-day facility. We have an incremental $2.5 billion of liquidity to support our global growth and expansion initiatives. We have an active construction pipeline with 32 major projects currently underway across 22 metros in 14 countries. We made a few minor adjustments to our ready for service dates in certain markets, while we continue to work closely with our suppliers and partners to deliver the capacity as close to the target dates as possible with limited impact on our guidance for the year. And we expect another year of active builds and are maintaining our full year capital expansion guidance. As we have said before, we believe the diversity of our business across verticals, sectors, markets and customers, puts us in a highly favorable position to both capitalize on industry trends, but also weather the macro shifts and increased volatility. Specifically, our current revenue exposure to the travel, energy and retail industries is less than 3%. Also, I want to reiterate the importance we place on our employees, our customers and our communities. Let me provide you two examples: We placed certain restrictions on access to our IBXs to protect both our employees and our customers. As a result, in certain circumstances, we're providing three Smart Hands professional services to the affected customers for a period of time. This has a direct impact on our short-term revenues, but is the right thing to do. This adjustment has been reflected in our current financial guidance. Also, our greater than 2,500 IBX employees received a one-time cash bonus to help them address personal needs, given the shelter-in-place requirements in their communities while all other employees were provided a stipend to help support their work-from-home requirements. As a result, for the first quarter, the COVID-19 impact to revenues and adjusted EBITDA was $3 million and $14 million, respectively. On a constant currency basis, and absent the COVID-19 adjustments, both revenues and adjusted EBITDA were above the top end of our guidance range and AFFO and AFFO per share were above our expectations. Now, let me cover the quarterly highlights. Know that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on slide four, global Q1 revenues were $1.445 billion, up 7% over the same quarter last year, our 69th consecutive quarter of revenue growth. Q1 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $15 million negative FX impact due to weaker operating currencies with particular impact on the Euro, the British pound, and the Brazilian real when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $684 million, up 2% compared to the prior quarter and 5% over the same quarter last year, mainly due to strong revenue flow-through from price increases and deal mix. As is typical, we had about $18 million of higher seasonal costs in Q1, primarily attributed to the FICA reset and our annual sales conference. For Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, included a negative $7 million FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q1 AFFO was $535 million, above our expectations on a constant currency basis due to strong operating performance and lower than planned interest expense and income taxes. Our strong operating performance is expected to offset financial impacts related to COVID-19. And as such, as Charles noted, we are reaffirming our AFFO and AFFO per share guidance at midpoint on a constant currency basis. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on slides five through seven. EMEA and APAC were the fastest MRR growing regions on a normalized year-over-year basis at 12% and 9%, respectively, followed by the Americas region at 4%. The Americas region saw its best-ever Q1 price adjusted gross or PAG bookings with a high number of small deals and healthy pricing. Also, as expected, the Americas region continued to export substantial activity to the other two regions, highlighting the value of our global platform and the strength of the Americas selling engine. Bookings included wins with mission-critical digital infrastructure networks and work-from-home service providers. We continue to expect the Americas revenue growth rate to trend upwards to 5% or greater as we progress through 2020. Our EMEA region saw growth across its 22 metros and limited impact from COVID-19. Demand was weighted towards our four largest markets, being Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London, and Paris, with channel activity driving solid bookings into our smaller markets as well. EMEA cabinets billing reduced over the prior quarter due to timing of cabinet installations in both Q4 last year, which was very strong. And delayed installations in Q1 this year, which we expect to be realized in Q2. Deal pricing remained very firm. And Asia-Pacific region saw solid bookings with a record in Hong Kong and a significant uptick in Shanghai. Demand was strong across all verticals with increased need for bandwidth across many organizations, given the extended work-from-home mandates. And now looking at the capital structure, please refer to slide eight. As it relates to our liquidity position, we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of unrestricted cash on the balance sheet with an additional $1.7 billion of unused capacity from our revolving line of credit. Our net debt leverage ratio was 3.9 times at Q1. Annualized adjusted EBITDA up slightly due to the cash used to complete the acquisitions in the quarter. Also, we remain steadfastly committed to driving long-term shareholder value. And we will continue to fund the business from the healthy operating cash flows generated by the business, while also accessing both the debt and equity capital markets as appropriate. Also, note that achieving investment-grade our investment-grade ratings last year has proven to be a highly strategic and an important milestone for Equinix. Despite the recent volatility in the debt markets, we continue to review opportunities to refinance our existing debt tranches on a net present value positive basis. And today, that would not be possible without being investment-grade rated. We do expect to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt over the next 12 months. And note, there is currently no benefit attributed to our debt refinancings in the current AFFO or AFFO per share guidance. Turning to slide nine for the quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $400 million, including seasonally low recurring CapEx of $18 million. We opened two new expansions in the quarter, including a new IBX in Warsaw. And we announced two new expansion projects, one in Frankfurt and the other in Singapore, two of our strongest global markets. We continue to expand our ownership, acquiring land for development in both France and Australia. Also, we recently purchased our Sa\u0303o Paulo one IBX. Revenue from owned assets remained at 55%, but we expect this percent to rise by the end of the year. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on slide 10. Our now 148 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Also consistent with prior year, during Q1, we completed the annual refresh of our IBX categorization exercise. Our stabilized asset count increased by net 12 IBXs. These stabilized assets are collectively 84% utilized and generate a 29% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for our summary of 2020 guidance and bridges. Do note, our 2020 guidance includes the financial results from both the xScale and Packet acquisitions. Starting with revenues, we expect to deliver a 7% to 9% growth rate for 2020, a reflection of the continued momentum in the business and includes a negative FX impact of $105 million, net of our FX hedges compared to our prior guidance. Also, we expect revenues attributed to the Packet acquisition for the 10-month period of our ownership to range between $32 million and $40 million. And MRR churn is expected to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter for the year. We expect 2020 adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 48%, excluding integration costs, the result of strong operating leverage in the business, offset in part by the expected higher utilities and property tax expense and a meaningful investment in our go-to-market and product organizations. We expect to incur $20 million of integration costs in 2020, $10 million to integrate Packet and the remaining $10 million to finalize the integration of our various other acquisitions. 2020 AFFO is expected to grow between 11% and 16% compared to the previous year. For 2020, we expect AFFO per share to grow between 8% and 12%, excluding capital market activities. Including capital market activities, we expect AFFO per share to be greater than 8%, consistent with our long-term AFFO per share growth objective, as discussed at our June 2018 Analyst Day. So, let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles. Charles, just further to your comments, I'd make the comment that we saw not only strong pricing in Europe, we saw it across the platform, which is important, Jon, as we think about our business. We talked about the fact that there's net positive pricing actions. Again, it's not just Europe, but again, it's across the platform. And it gives us confidence that we're continuing to see, on a currency-neutral basis. Clearly, there was some currency impact to the metrics which we share in our earnings deck. But overall, we're delighted with what we're doing. And part of what Charles also alluded to and we talked about it, Packet and some of our other service offerings, it is our view that it will continue to add value on a per cabinet basis. I think there's going to be a higher attach rate, and I think interconnection is going to continue to be strong. And all of that sort of lends to a more positive pricing environment for Equinix. Sure. Yes. We did see slightly less this quarter than we anticipated, roughly 1.2%. If I go to the same quarter last year, it was 1.5% of revenues. Meaning, certainly, as we're all aware during the latter part of the quarter, things started to slow down a little bit. We also were putting our IBXs into a more restricted fashion. No surprise as things took root in different parts of the world. But all that said, when you look at our overall guidance, we're still looking at somewhere around $150 million to $160 million of capital that will go into recurring and only a portion of that, of course, is maintenance, roughly 2% of our recurring CapEx is maintenance. And so you'll see it go back to a more traditional level in Q2. That's reflected in the guidance. And then for the year, you'll see it. Roughly a little bit lower than we saw last year, but roughly in line with what our expectations would be on a go-forward basis. Sure. The second question, Mike, the zero to $50 million that Charles commented in his prepared remarks vis-a\u0300-vis the revenues. It's really a reflection. There's a lot going on with the global pandemic, and there has been some uncertainty that's created. Having said that, we had a really strong Q1. Charles alluded to the fact that we have a very, very healthy pipeline, and we've had a great start to Q2. And so we recognize that. All that said is, when we think about the scenario planning, which we and I assume many others are doing, what are the potential implications on the business. And of course, we've thought about different things. Could there be an extension of the book-to-bill cycle? Could there be a weakening of the pipeline? Again, we haven't seen that yet, but these are examples. And hence, as you look forward in understanding what are the overall implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, we sized it of $0 to $50 million. Now, having said that, the first quarter, we've absorbed $3 million already. That $3 million, $2 million of it relates to Smart Hands that we basically in certain cases, with customers will offer free Smart Hand services because of the restrictions that were placed on our IBXs, and then there was a small sales allowance that we put in place. As we look forward, we're going to continue to offer those on a selected basis to certain customers Smart Hands. And therefore, on a go-forward basis, that will continue for some period until we have better clarity on how, if you will, our business and the rest of the businesses around the world will open back up. And then other things that we've thought about are what are the implications on customers on whether we need to make concessions as it relates to invoices that have already been generated, to write-downs to companies that go out of business, and we've reflected all of that. And hence, when you look at the revenue guidance page that we delivered in our earnings deck, you have a pretty good sense of what the scenarios are that we could plan for here. Yet having said all of that, we're going to run the business to deliver against our AFFO target at the midpoint or better. And so that sort of gives you a sense of what we're anticipating. But right now, the most concrete thing I can tell you is that there's selected -- sorry, select cases where we're delivering Smart Hands for free to our customers to certain customers. I think it's well said, Charles. Thanks. Sure. Jordan, as you can appreciate, still pretty early in the process. As we've referred to, it was really the latter half of the quarter where we start to feel the more larger impact to the pandemic. Having said all of that, our Q1, when we reported out, our DSOs actually improved, particularly in Europe and particularly for those extended terms. And so our DSOs dropped one full day to 42 days. So it gives you a sense that our collections continue to be very strong. You'll see in our 10-Q that we report that are actually our even though our revenues went up, our accounts receivable went down quarter-over-quarter. So that gives you a sense really that right now, we don't see it as an issue. As we look into April, we still don't see it as an issue. And now that we've closed April, but we have a pretty good idea on how we're coming in, in April. And as Charles and I have both alluded to, we feel pretty good about the first month of the new quarter. As it relates to concessions, absolutely, there are customers out there that have asked for concessions. But do remember, our top 50 customers represent 40% of our business, and you know who our top customers are. And so it will be at the far end of the tail, typically that customers will be asking for some type of concession. I to be honest, I don't have the visibility given that it just hasn't amounted to anything significant at that point at this point in time. But we are assuming that there will be customers who will eventually ask for concessions or who already have asked for concessions. Just like you're hearing out in the marketplace from our peers and other like industries. So why don't I stop there, let me pass it back to you, Charles, just on the--"

            "name": "Charles Meyers",
            "content": "Thanks Kat. Good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Before we get into the results of the quarter, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the unprecedented times in our world and share our approach to this continuously evolving situation. First and foremost, our hearts go out to all those who have been impacted by COVID-19, and we extend our gratitude to all the frontline workers who are helping to keep us safe and healthy as we navigate this together. From the beginning, we've approached this situation with a consistent set of priorities: protecting the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners; ensuring the availability and continuity of our services that underpin the operation of the digital economy; and stepping up to do our part to mitigate the impacts of this crisis on people and communities around the world. Very early on, we activated our business continuity plans with the goal of ensuring seamless operations through this crisis. I'm incredibly proud of our teams across the company and moved by the care, kindness and courage they are demonstrating each day in service to each other, to our customers and to our communities. As in many other crisis situations through the years, the dedication and professionalism of our operations team has been unwavering, particularly as they were forced to adapt to our policies and procedures to rapidly changing conditions, keeping safety first while ensuring responsiveness to the needs of our customers. Thanks to our global teams, our facilities have remained safe, available and fully operational, and our customer satisfaction scores are at an all-time high. As is often the case, times of crisis reveal fundamental insights about an organization, and COVID-19 is no exception. First, we have seen remarkable resilience of our people and the tremendous strength of our culture. We talk every day about the magic of Equinix. A reference to our culture that might sound light or ephemeral to many, but when a global pandemic puts every aspect of your business and your life into flux, you quickly realize that 10,000 people committed to value like we before me and find a better way is truly a force to be reckoned with. Second, we're seeing a magnification of the role that Equinix plays not only for our customers but in the basic operation of our society. The massive work-from-home experiment in which we find ourselves, has created a spike of near-term demand from a variety of customers, much of which we believe will sustain even as we calibrate on a new normal. And perhaps most importantly, the unique characteristics of this particular crisis have increased the resolve we see from customers relative to their focus on digital transformation as a long-term priority and have highlighted the relevance of Equinix in supporting these efforts. But this crisis has also created a level of distraction and friction in the overall economy that reinforces the importance of the real-time on-demand scalability provided by services like ECX Fabric and Network Edge, and highlights the need for us to continue our efforts to deliver an even more digitally-enabled experience for our customers. And finally, it's times like these where we must stay focused on long-term value creation and maintain the level of commercial discipline that has served us so well for the past decade. We continue to make prudent decisions in the face of our current realities, maintaining the priorities I outlined and ensuring that our balance sheet will sustain us through a wide range of scenarios. These explicit decisions, along with some limited purchase and installation delays, have led us to modestly widen our full year guidance, but we continue to see strong underlying performance of the business with particular vibrancy in our market-leading interconnection franchise, which is rapidly approaching $1 billion run rate business. Our funnel remains healthy with a line of sight to a strong Q2, and we're reaffirming our AFFO guide as a midpoint for the year on a constant currency basis. We are delighted that the Equinix business model continues to be resilient through times of uncertainty enabling us to step-up for our employees, our customers and our communities. While there are undoubtedly many challenges and much uncertainty still in front of us, I've never been more optimistic about the future of Equinix and the magnitude of the opportunity ahead. Now, let me turn to the quarter and the details of our results. We had a great start to the year, delivering strong Q1 bookings, underpinned by a diverse customer demand and robust interconnection growth. Our bookings span more than 3,000 customers, with cross-border bookings up substantially year-over-year. We processed over 4,000 deals in the quarter as our retail go-to-market engine continues to scale in response to our expanding market opportunity. Turning to our results, as depicted on slide three, revenues for the first quarter were $1.4 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 5% year-over-year and AFFO was meaningfully ahead of our expectations. Interconnection revenues grew 15% year-over-year, steadily rising in the last few quarters and a strong reflection of demand across our portfolio of Interconnection products, supporting a variety of customer needs and use cases. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our interconnection portfolio reflects a unique product set that is driving quantifiable customer value. We now have over 370,000 interconnections and delivered our 13th consecutive quarter of adding more interconnections than the rest of the top 10 competitors combined. In Q1, we added an incremental 6,800 interconnections fueled by video streaming and conferencing services and offset by a slight increase in network grooming after a Q4 pause. Peak Internet Exchange traffic grew 44% year-over-year and over 20% quarter-over-quarter, a significant jump driven by work-from-home traffic spikes. Customers are scaling into previously provisioned 100-gig growth capacity and ordering new capacity as we head into Q2. And ECX Fabric continues to be a bright spot with a strong growth in volume and ARPU as higher bandwidth and inter-metro connections become a larger share of the total. In March, we closed our acquisition of bare metal leader Packet, accelerating our ability to deliver physical infrastructure at software speed and enabling both service providers and enterprises to quickly and seamlessly deploy hybrid and multi-cloud architectures. Bare metal is a rapidly emerging category of digital infrastructure that enables businesses to deploy workloads on secure single-tenant hardware distributed geographically to support high levels of application performance and integrate fully with their choice of software and management platforms across a range of vendors. Deploying bare metal as a service on platform Equinix allows companies to accelerate time to market and reduce CapEx while enabling new use cases that require both public cloud and private infrastructure. This is a strategic part of our vision to evolve platform Equinix, interconnecting and integrating global businesses at the digital edge. We're excited to welcome the Packet team on board and are pleased to report that we expect the Packet acquisition to be roughly breakeven in 2020 from a dilution perspective. In April, we also announced our next milestone in our hyperscale strategy, launching a new xScale JV in Japan with GIC, following the success of our initial xScale JV with GIC in Europe. Our xScale approach is a critical element in our strategy amplifying our already deep balance sheet and allowing us to deliver superior returns on invested capital while strengthening Equinix' leadership position in the cloud ecosystem, and leveraging our substantial existing presence and go-to-market strength in major markets around the world. Now, let me cover highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical achieved its third highest bookings, driven by strong network reseller activity as well as meaningful capacity upgrades to support increased bandwidth for work-from-home employees. Expansions included Hurricane Electric, a leading global Internet backbone, utilizing ECX Fabric across 33 locations to allow enterprise customers real-time access to their IP transit offering as well as Reseller Goal Data, a leading America's telecom provider deploying edge nodes in advance of a cable landing station to improve connectivity with Latin America. Our financial services vertical continue to diversify led by APAC and capital market wins. This sector saw healthy new logo adds with meaningful growth in Fortune 500 and Global 2000 customers. New wins and expansions included a Fortune 500 financial services firm re-architecting their network and securely accessing ecosystem partners and a top five global currency exchange tapping into our dense financial services ecosystem across eight locations. Our content digital media vertical saw solid bookings with strength in video and social media. Expansions included Zoom extending coverage and scale to support their explosive market demand as well as TikTok. A top 10 social media platform deploying edge nodes to support coverage and scale of its content delivery platform. Two good examples of COVID-related demand on platform Equinix. Our cloud and IT vertical also saw strong bookings led by APAC and a significant increase in ECX Fabric participants. Expansions included a Fortune 500 security and networking company, deploying infrastructure to support new product offerings worldwide and Link [ph], Japanese IAS MSP deploying infrastructure to support customer experience and ecosystem access. Our enterprise vertical saw healthy bookings despite COVID-related friction in the back half of the quarter reflecting broad strength, including government, healthcare, and education. We continue to focus on helping firms re-architect their infrastructure to solve the challenges of speed, scale and security while enabling the move to next-generation digital platforms. New wins included Phreesia Inc., a U.S. healthcare platform, deploying regional infrastructure to deliver an enhanced customer experience as well as a Brazilian education institution deploying to support digital transformation and improved performance. Our channel program accounted for approximately 30% of bookings, and we continue to see great productivity from this go-to-market vector. We processed over 2,000 channel deals this quarter, our highest ever, with wins across a wide range of industry segments with projects focused on digital transformation efforts as well as COVID-19 response. New channel wins this quarter included a notable win with Verizon for a premier U.S. retailer transitioning from on-premise data centers to a hybrid multi-cloud solution to enhance elasticity and performance, and a joint win with British telecom for a Fortune 150 biopharma firm, deploying a multi-region SD-WAN solution optimized for speed and agility. Now, let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Thanks, Keith. Despite the challenges from COVID, the Equinix business is performing well, and we remain focused on the clear set of priorities we laid out at the beginning of the year; investing in our people; evolving our platform and service portfolio to meet the changing needs of customers; expanding our go-to-market engine to fuel long-term growth; and simplifying our business to drive operating leverage; and enhance our customers' experience. As we continue to navigate an uncertain environment, we will remain diligent, flexible, disciplined, and prepared across the company from how we set up our IBX technician shifts to enhance safety to increasing balance sheet liquidity, investing in new service development and hiring top talent to expand our selling engine, all while closely tracking our financial and operating metrics to ensure profitable growth and maintain a keen focus on AFFO per share as a lighthouse metric for the business. As we have in prior market dislocations, we will manage the business prudently with a long-term orientation and a clear objective to extend our market leadership. As our customers continue to make clear, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach and scale of our platform, the depth of our balance sheet and critically, the passion and resilience of our people will not only enable Equinix to weather the storm, but will position us to execute aggressively on the other side of this unprecedented crisis and capture the massive opportunity that lies ahead. So, let me stop there and open it up for questions. Hey Richard. Yes, I think we saw -- definitely saw -- it was quite a normal quarter, I think, for the first couple of months. And then as we as sort of COVID situation became a bit more acute, I think there was uncertainty that created some level of friction. Although, again, we had a really strong quarter across the board generally. But there was, I think, some buying friction in the system, but I would say we entered Q2 with a really healthy pipeline and actually saw strong early conversion of that pipeline in the quarter. And I think right now, we're seeing the early signs of a bit more return to normal and I think what we're also seeing is our selling team really becoming more accustomed to driving sales cycles in this setting. And so overall, we continue to feel good about the bookings productivity of the sales engine. That's a great question. I do think that we can accelerate growth in that business. It's obviously a relatively small business now. I think there's a meaningful opportunity associated with this kind of bare metal private infrastructure immediately proximate to the public cloud. And by the way, I think it really fits well with kind of what people are seeing and how they're responding to COVID in terms of their desire to be able to deploy infrastructure in a more frictionless way. And so we think as we add enterprise feature set, as we extend our partnerships with the software players and platforms like VMware, Red Hat, et cetera, that people have really invested significantly and that it's going to be a real tool for us as people deploy hybrid and multi-cloud architectures. So, I think that we'll have to reset when we give you a more longer-term guide and talk about that. But I do think there's an opportunity for us to expand growth in that offering. Sure. Remind me the first one, Jon, I'm sorry. Yes, I think we haven't really seen a meaningful change in the competitive environment in Europe, and our demand continues to be strong. I think we're seeing healthy pipeline and healthy bookings as well as strong pricing in the European theater. So, we haven't really seen a meaningful change. We'll continue to monitor that and determine if that's -- if there's any change to that. And then relative to the broader sort of COVID in terms of how it's settling out in cabinet adds and pricing, et cetera. I'll let Keith add here as he wishes. But yes, as we said in the script, I think firm pricing, in particular, in Europe, we're continuing to navigate sort of adjustments in our interconnection pricing very effectively. I mean I think that's given us some nice lift from a price adjusted gross booking standpoint. I think cabinet adds, you saw Europe was a particular oddity caused by basically something that happens every now and then, which is a pull forward from cabinets into Q4 from Q1 and a push out for cabinets out of Q1 into Q2. And so I do think you're going to see -- we saw a very strong Q4, and I think we're going to see a strong Q2. But obviously, we saw a weaker Q1. But I don't think that's a reflection on demand. I just think that's one of the things we've always encouraged you to look at sort of rolling four-quarter averages on cabinet adds. I think cabinet adds are going to be slightly lower, particularly in Europe, maybe as we continue to adjust our mix. Because if you look far enough back, you saw quarters where there were really large cabinet adds in there, associated with hyperscale type deals. We would really prefer, obviously, to direct that business to the xScale JVs and keep our capacity and our capital applied to the very high-return retail business. And so I think that will impact cabinet adds to some degree, but that's fully contemplated kind of how we're guiding in the business, and we think it's going to, again, have favorable impact on other core operating metrics. Keith, anything to add there? Yes. And I might add -- I might, Jon, have just one more bit of color that kind of bridges between your question and Richard's prior question. What we're finding from a booking standpoint and overall selling productivity is a bit of kind of puts and takes. There's been -- as I said, there was some friction associated with sort of, I think, the near term towards the end of Q1, we're getting back to where people are adjusting, and we're seeing some relief on that. But interestingly and perhaps counterintuitively, we're seeing greater access to decision-makers. Decision-makers are kind of having -- maybe having a different schedule phenomenon, and we seem to be having greater access to decision-makers and seeing a greater resolve on their part to make commitments to move forward aggressively with their digital transformation needs. Now, I think it may mean some delays in some cases, just out of, again, depending on the sector and depending on how acute their other issues might be. But if anything, we're seeing a greater level of resolve in terms of how they're thinking about digital transformation. So, it's a bit of puts and takes. But again, I think we're off to a strong start in Q2 and feeling good about the pipeline. The -- Frank, I'm sorry, I lost the first one again. These double questions are killing me today. Yes, I'm sorry. Yes, I don't think so. I think that I think we're seeing that as a response. I think the question of whether or not the demand that is creating that will be sustained over time. I think that's a reasonable question. And -- but I think for the most part, people are generally, they design their networks with a certain amount of headroom where they design their overall delivery systems with a certain amount of headroom. The work-from-home obviously chewed up a lot of that headroom and people had to scramble to add capacity. I think we were incredibly responsive in helping people do that. But I don't think that -- and I think there's some chance that the headroom increases as we moderate more towards a new normal. But I don't think it's going to -- I don't think it will have a huge impact because I think it was more of a burst that we saw there offset to some degree by other factors. And I think we're just kind of going to normalize, hopefully, more so in the back half, again, barring any kind of second wave or any other strange dynamics. So -- and I don't think from a capacity situation, I think most markets were in very good shape, and not worried about parting ways with that capacity in terms of creating constraints in the back half. And as for interconnection, again, I really feel good about the way the business is trending. We were more towards the low end of what we were guiding in terms of total count, but we had a very strong gross adds quarter, the strongest in several years. And -- but we also had some elevated churn associated with some network grooming, both seen 10 to 100 migrations and some consolidation activity in terms of people who are undergoing acquisitions and consolidating networks associated with that. But the virtual cross connection, we think people -- one of the things we talked about in the script is ARPU going up, and that's a real reflection of people buying ports. And then provisioning cross-connects and driving traffic on them in ways that are increasing the ARPU on a per-connection basis. And so we're actually seeing that right in line, if not better, than our physical cross-connects. And so we're really, really pleased with the overall trajectory on the ECX Fabric. You bet, Frank. Sure. Is that -- was that it? Or do you have another one? Sure. I'll take the first one, and then Keith can comment on the second one, and I'll add as appropriate. So, channel, yes, again, very excited about the momentum we have in channel. And I would say it's largely attributable to the enterprise market, Mike. We -- I think that's where we're really seeing the effectiveness of our channel partners in terms of reaching enterprises with whom they have long-standing relationships, existing contractual vehicles, et cetera. And then also with some of our channel partners, where we're combining our value with theirs to create a full customer solution. And by the way, the hyperscalers fall into that category as well, as they have now seen a very clear sort of signal of the demand for hybrid cloud. If they're seeing a sales cycle being restrained by the need to satisfy the private portion of the hybrid cloud requirement, then they're coming to us, bringing us in and allowing us to help them get that resolved so that they can really satisfy the public cloud demand. And so we see it across a range of channel partners and also across a range of verticals, but really combining our value with that of our partners to solve end customer needs. And in terms of -- but definitely very slanted towards the enterprise. And then in terms of visibility, what I would tell you is that today, we are primarily what I would refer to as a sell with channel. So, we are still in the relatively earlier phases of channel maturity and we're not yet at a point where, generally, people are selling the Equinix value proposition on their own. They're typically engaged with the client, a customer. They engage our sales team. We sell jointly. We comp our direct rep as well as the channel partner, a little bit of cost in there, but really quite modest when you consider it relative to the total customer lifetime value. And so we are getting really good visibility. And of course, they have to register deals to get paid. So, we get really good visibility to the overall funnel on the channel side. So, Keith, I'll let you handle the sort of the discussion on the revenue guide. Yes. And Mike, I mean, obviously, just it is more than -- that range is impacted by more than just as Smart Hands, as Keith indicated. And it was just argued that given the uncertainty about the depth and duration of exactly what we'll see here, that it was prudent for us to give a -- consider those other items like book-to-bill and some modest level of concessions. And try to size those and say what could that impact be during the course of the year and let's adjust accordingly. But again, we're feeling good about the early start to Q2, feeling good about the discussions we're having with customers, which are quite limited relative to concessions, et cetera. And so we're feeling good about where we're headed. Sure. So, xScale is going well. I think there's lots of demand. It's a complex business in terms of both the construction side of the business and all that comes with building large-scale projects like that as well as the sort of demand side of the business and dealing with very -- certainly large and important and strategically critical, but also very demanding customers. But the -- I think that they've always demonstrated a strong appetite for us to be satisfying a portion of their large footprint demand. And so we're very engaged with them and seeing a strong pipeline not only for the projects that we already have underway or built out, but for new markets as well. And so very healthy and vigorous dialogue with customers. And as I've always said, it wasn't our -- we aren't planning to be really chase after market share at all costs and hyperscale. Our view is work to generate -- work to win the market demand that we think is critical to cloud ecosystem positioning and we think we're -- we feel like we're being very successful in those conversations. And then obviously, we're very excited about the Japanese JV. We think it's a terrific market. We think we're well-positioned. We think that supply is going to be somewhat scarce and difficult. And we think -- and therefore, we've had a lot of interest in the capacity that we're projecting to bring to market. So I really feel good about that. And again, as Keith indicated, we're underway with additional JV conversations in other parts around the world as well already. Relative to churn, again, we did have some churn that impacted the EMEA cabinet adds and brought us a little bit towards the higher end of the range. But I think two to 2.5 is -- we're just -- we're comfortable in that range. And we, of course, are doing everything we can to manage that towards the bottom end. But I would just reiterate, we're comfortable with that range. Sure. Yes, we did see -- we actually had a good quarter on new logos, and we tried to unpack that in terms of was that in the first two-thirds of the quarter and what do we see in the back half. And it was lighter and I would say our bookings from new customers was slightly less than it has, but not in a meaningful -- a particularly material way. I do think it's harder. We're finding that we're having to learn a new set of skills around being able to get an account over the line fully without the physical interaction. But I think we're already seeing that take root. And we've already actually given our sales teams, a number of new tools to be more effective in that setting. And so I think if there is that -- but obviously, there is some level of friction. And I think we just need to be cognizant of that. And that's why when we talked about the bottom end -- widening the bottom end of the range a little bit; it really reflects some of that. And our hope is that we are -- we return to some form of normal sooner rather than later. But even without that, we feel like the sales team can be fairly productive. But there is some level of friction in new logo capture undoubtedly. And then relative to network grooming, it is no, we did not see it as COVID-related. It was associated with some additional 10 to 100 kind of migrations and then also associated with some network consolidation associated with prior acquisitions. And so we saw a little bit of a and it's not atypical. You usually see a slowdown in Q4 because of the sort of network quiet periods. And then you see some of that activity sort of take place in Q1. So, not particularly surprising to us. And as I said, I do think that we're probably at a point now where a lot of the initial bump of 10 to 100 kind of went through with some of the largest players. But there's going to be a continuation of that as -- because the minute it becomes economic for somebody to upgrade electronics based on their route analysis, they're clearly going to do that. So, there's going to be a little bit of that in there, but we feel really comfortable with that sort of $7,000 to $9,000 per quarter guide and the gross adds are particularly encouraging. You bet. Great. Let me comment on the first one, for sure. I'll give you a little bit on the second one, maybe Keith can add in, and then I'll ask Kat to maybe jump in and talk about the status on Analyst Day. But in terms of bookings, as to if we looked at it and said, what's our is our expectation now that it's going to be the same, better or worse than what we would than what we thought be coming into the beginning of the year. Obviously, I think by virtue of the fact that we've widened the bottom end of the range and, therefore, slightly lowered the midpoint on our revenue guide; I think we're indicating that there will be risk balanced towards the downside in terms of bookings and revenue. But that, that risk is actually fairly modest. And so I think that would be the way I would characterize it. Again, we've very strong Q2 strong Q1 bookings, strong Q2 pipeline, where we see signs of sort of friction and some of the factors that were impacting us sort of at the peak of COVID beginning to moderate. And so our hope would be that we -- we'll see that, that risk will dissipate. But I think that's an accurate characterization is that since we lightened the bottom end, we would see a little bit more downside risk from what we had originally planned. But I also think there's opportunities for us to continue to close those gaps during the course of the year, which kind of brings me to the second question, which is, is that all one? Reiterating it is in all Smart Hands, it's a portion of that. If you -- as Keith said, a couple of million made in the quarter. But obviously, it was a relatively short stub period. Should that occur throughout Q2, Q3, and Q4, we would see, obviously, more than that, which would contribute to a meaningful portion of that $50 million but then there's other things in terms of potential book-to-bill delays, concessions and sales reserves, et cetera, that might also impact that. And so I think it was our best judgment about how to reflect what we thought the risks were by opening up the bottom end slightly and leaving the top end. In that if things mitigate quickly, we get back to a more normal environment that -- and the business continues to perform well even in this environment, that we think we can close those gaps. So, that's kind of what I would say. Keith, I don't know if you have anything to add on that second topic? Sure. That's a lot, but I wrote it down this time and I make a note so I can remember it. Keith, maybe you can start with the first pieces there on concessions and collections, et cetera. Yes. And then maybe on the -- you like to ask for a little maybe more specifics on the book-to-bill. We do see occasionally, some people saying, hey, we were scheduled to implement this and begin billing on this commencement date. Obviously, we're not comfortable having our teams out there to finish that deployment. We'd like to push that out a bit. And so I think there is some of that, again, fairly limited in the grand scheme of things, but I think those are the types of things that we think we -- and we do see some of those. And we're accommodating those requests because we think that's the right thing to do given the situations. But there's a relatively small number of those. And then relative to the churn and EMEA, there was some large footprint churn. I think it's pretty -- it would be pretty typical indicative of it. As I said in our -- in my prepared comments, maintaining our commercial discipline, continuing these were really larger footprint deals, lower-yielding returns on capital and the kind of things where you do continue to see people re-architect towards different solutions. And so nothing particularly surprising there, but a couple that hit in the quarter and caused both a reduction in -- or an increase in churn and a reduction in cabinet adds. But of course, those cabinets go right back into the hopper. And we intend to resell them at a significantly higher price point and margin profile, given what is a really favorable trend on mix of business in EMEA. You bet. Yes. I mean, we feel really good. I would say that the -- look, we view ourselves very much as a global platform. And so continuing to extend the strength our strength in key markets around the world and being able to meet a more comprehensive set of our customers' needs across a variety of solution requirements, including the very large footprint, just we think increases our overall global position, not obviously, in market, in Japan, and we think that, as I said, I think given what we see as potential supply constraints in that market and what others customers are seeing as potential supply constraints, we feel really good about our ability to generate utilization and bookings and, therefore, strong returns from our Japan JV. But it is part of a much bigger picture. We have an incredible business in APAC. Being able to serve customers in the primary sort of APAC markets that they're looking to deploy and is a key part of our strategy, and we're excited about the overall trajectory there. And then in terms of the U.S., looking more interesting. Again, I think it continues to be a very highly competitive market with some markets like in Ashburn, for example, at the large footprint end of the spectrum being, I think, in an imbalanced supply and demand situation, which is highly pressuring prices, et cetera. We feel very fortunate that we maintain a very different franchise in Ashburn and have seen tremendous health and strong price durability in our Ashburn -- in our business in Ashburn. But I think our appetite in the U.S. will be more limited for sure. Although I do think that we look at a campus like Dallas with having the potential to add large footprint capacity in immediate proximity to the Infomart, that is a very unique proposition that we would sort of resonate with. So -- but we're going to be very selective there just because we think there's other better opportunities for us around the world. You bet."

At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thanks, Katrina. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. We had a great finish to the year with our best booking performance ever driven by an exceptional demand backdrop for our business with continued strength across our platform, but more specifically in the Americas low churn and continued momentum in our digital services portfolio. For the full-year, we achieved over $6.6 billion of revenue, marking our 76 consecutive quarter top line increases and amazing 19 years of continuous revenue growth while driving attractive AFFO per share to the bottom line. Amidst the dynamic and complex global landscape, we continue to deliver against our vision and our fiscal year results demonstrate both the increasing relevance of our platform and our uniquely differentiated value proposition. Businesses globally continue to prioritize digital transformation as a foundational source of competitive advantage and the secular drivers for our business have never been stronger, as digital leaders demand infrastructure that is more distributed, more ecosystem powered, more flexible, more sustainable and more interconnected than ever before. Increasingly, Equinix represents a critical point of Nexus customers implement hybrid and multi cloud as a clear architecture of choice. And as a global market leader, we continue to innovate and expand our portfolio to respond to these evolving customer demands, and capture the enormous opportunity ahead. As we look to 2022, the trajectory and underlying momentum in our business is exceptionally strong, with a solid demand pipeline, stable churn and a rising price trend, resulting in a revenue outlook for the year that is at or above the high end of our long-term guidance range. And an AFFO per share outlook is still within our long-term guidance range, despite pressure at the gross margin line associated with power price volatility in Singapore. Absent these specific dynamics our underlying business performance will be producing AFFO per share growth towards the high-end of our Analyst Day guidance well ahead of our expectations. We have a robust global power hedging program [indiscernible] and we expect will continue to be highly effective in smoothing utility price volatility over the years, providing predictability and value across markets for Equinix and our customers. We believe the current dislocation in Singapore is transitory with higher prices showing signs of moderating in the second half of the year. Bottom line, the business is performing very well. And we remain on track to meeting or exceeding our Analyst Day objectives for both top line revenue and AFFO per share growth and as we see the temporary headwinds moderate, and continue to realize efficiency gains from prior-year investments, we have a strong resolve and continued confidence in our ability to scale adjusted EBITDA margins to 50% by 2025. Turning to our results as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for the full-year were $6.6 billion up 8% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA was also up 8% year-over-year, and AFFO per share grew 9% year-over-year. Interconnection revenues for the current quarter grew 12% year-over-year with solid unit ads reflecting strong momentum with Equinix Fabric as expanding use cases drive connections to more locations and more counterparties. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our global reach remains as important as ever. IDC predicts that by 2025, more than 50% of enterprise data will be generated at the edge, and customers continue to see Equinix as the best manifestation of the digital edge. This competitive differentiation continues to drive our business, with revenues from multi-region customers increasing 1% quarter-over-quarter to an impressive 75%. In December, we announced our long awaited entry into Africa with our intended acquisition of MainOne, a leading West African data center and connectivity solutions provider with a presence in Nigeria, Ghana and the Ivory Coast, set to close in early Q2.\n, : Jon has delivered extraordinary results as the President of our Americas business and is a great choice to implement our strategy and extend our global market leadership and interconnected colocation. To that end, we continue to expand on our global footprint with 41 major projects underway across 28 metros in 19 countries, representing over 20,000 cabinets of retail, and over 80 megawatts of xScale capacity. We remain focused on simplifying, automating and digitizing our services, allowing us to scale our business and enhance operating leverage. And we're already seeing the results of these efforts. For example, we recently launched our new Secure Cab Express product, leveraging pre-deployed capacity to dramatically reduce cycle times and enable online quoting and ordering for our most commonly requested configurations. We expect to roll this new service out to customers in the coming quarters, driving increased customer responsiveness while simultaneously enhancing margins. Our global interconnection franchise continues to perform well and we now have over 419,000 interconnections on our industry leading platform. In Q4, we added an incremental 7,500 organic interconnections as enterprises drive growth and further enhance our ecosystem density. Internet exchange saw peak traffic of 6% quarter-over-quarter and 27% year-over-year, with peak traffic in APAC surpassing 10 terabits per second, for the first time as service providers increasingly look to IX to improve Internet traffic delivery. Turning to digital infrastructure services, cloud computing has permanently reshaped customer expectations for speed and simplicity. Customers want to deploy infrastructure where they want it, when they want it seamlessly integrating cloud based workloads and private infrastructure and enabling agility and performance between the two. As a result, customers are embracing a broader set of our services, combining fabric, metal and network edge to build virtual points of presence. And our plan expansions will fully enable this capability across 30 markets by the end of 2022. For the quarter, Equinix Fabric saw excellent growth eclipsing $150 million in revenue run rate with a third of our customers now using Fabric for a variety of use cases across a broad set of destinations. Our Equinix Metal business delivered strong results with a great mix of wins and new logos across verticals at a healthy backlog. And network edge saw continued traction with growth from new and existing customers, as they use the service to implement WAN optimization and cloud-to-cloud routing. Shifting to xScale, in January we announced plans to expand xScale into South Korea with an agreement to establish a $525 million joint venture with GIC to develop two data centers installed. Total investment in our various hyperscale joint ventures when closed and fully built out is now expected to be more than $8 billion across 36 facilities globally, with more than 720 megawatts of power capacity. We currently have nine xScale bills under development and during the quarter, we fully leased the first phase of our Frankfurt 11 asset and the first and second phases of our Sao Paulo 5 assets representing approximately 20 megawatts of capacity. So xScale leasing is now over 130 megawatts and our initial JV at EMEA is over 80% leased. Now let me cover some of the highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical had solid bookings quarter with healthy new logo activity led by the Americas as companies expand and optimize digital capabilities to support the delivery and consumption of data at the edge. New wins and expansions included a Fortune 200 telecom company deploying infrastructure to support the U.S. first cloud native Open RAN-based 5G network. Inligo Networks, an Australian cable systems operator deploying digital infrastructure to support a new subsea cable across Southeast Asia, Australia and the U.S. and an African local telco, deploying a network hub in Lisbon to improve pairing and performance. Our enterprise virtual saw another quarter of record bookings, as IDC predicts almost half of the global economy will be based on or influenced by digital in 2022, fueling strong demand for hybrid infrastructure. Q4 had particular strength in FinTech, industrial services and energy sub segments with wins and expansions, including NASDAQ, a Fortune 500 technology company, scaling its cloud enabled infrastructure to deliver ultra low latency Edge compute capabilities from our NY11 data center in Carteret. Avaya, cloud communications and workstream collaboration company implementing an Edge data center strategy on platform Equinix to streamline private connectivity for its customers and ADT, U.S. leading smart home security provider embracing the cloud with an infrastructure modernization effort spanning multiple geographies. Our cloud and IT services vertical offset solid bookings this quarter led by the software and infrastructure sub segments, with good momentum in EMEA and APAC. The expansions included Zscaler, a leading Global 2000 Security cloud provider, upgrading capacity for sustainable enterprise cloud transformation, and growing network traffic at the Edge. Wiz Technologies, a Singaporean full-suite IT service provider, deploying on Equinix Metal and upgrading Fabric services to support quick and seamless business expansion. And Oracle, a top five global software provider deploying FastConnect Cloud on-ramps to support new regions in Singapore, Milan and Stockholm, bringing their total number of on-ramps available at Equinix to 24 more than any of their other partners. Our content digital media vertical has strong wins led by the publishing and digital media sub segments and record channel activity. Expansions included Cloudflare, the U.S. based global web infrastructure and security company upgrading and expanding their footprint in over 40 markets. Index Exchange, global ad tech marketplace, expanding compute nodes in APAC demanded traffic growth, and a top three global credit agency deploying regional network in cloud hubs in APAC to support its operations. Our channel program delivered a record quarter to close the year accounting for 40% of bookings and nearly 60% of new logos. And we have line of sight for channels to grow to 50% of our bookings in the coming years as we enhance our systems and processes, and leverage our diverse set of partners to scale our reach. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals, and use cases with continued strength from strategic partners like Microsoft, Dell, Cisco, Google and BT, including a significant win with Wipro and AT&T, helping a utility company modernize its IT infrastructure, Europe and the U.S. So now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter.\n, : Jon has delivered extraordinary results as the President of our Americas business and is a great choice to implement our strategy and extend our global market leadership and interconnected colocation.

Good afternoon to everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks by saying our business is performing extremely well. Frankly, better than our expectations for both the quarter and year. And we're bringing our momentum into 2022. We had a great end for the year delivering record gross and net bookings with very strong channel activity, while recording our highest ever recurring revenue step up in a quarter. For the year without any major acquisitions revenues were up over $600 million. [Indiscernible] over 17,500 deals in 2021, highlighting the tremendous scale and reach of our business, the philosophy of our go-to-market engine. The Americas region continues to pick up stream growing 10% over the prior year effective double the rate approval from last year benefiting from strong leadership and is distributed portfolio of highly interconnected IBX assets resulting in record bookings and lower churn. For the company, our churn settled at the lower end of our guidance range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter, or an average of 2.1% per quarter for the year. Our lowest level since 2016, which is highly reflective of our strategy to put the right customer with the right applications into the right IBX. Quite simply, the decisions we're making are stressing and extending our leadership position as the world's digital infrastructure company. Now, as previously discussed perhaps top of mind for you, there are a number of macro-economic factors that we continue to proactively manage, such as supply chain, power costs, interest rates, and inflation. As it relates to power costs, we're seeing approximately 130 basis points in your margin pressure, due to the temporarily inflated power rates in Singapore, and the lapping of the favorable vPPA settlements from Texas last February. For 2022, we're predominantly hedged to meet our global parties, but intends to continue to layer in additional hedges for the remaining '22 exposure, and to meet the demand for future periods as we navigate past is unusually volatile period. As Charles noted, we expect the market dislocation in Singapore to be transitory, largely given the current prices are significantly higher than any other markets that we operate in, and the spot market rates appear to be trending down, although they do remain volatile. As reflected in our guidance, we expect second half margin to improve over the first half and we remain on our path to deliver against our Analyst Day adjusted EBITDA and AFSL margin expectations. As it relates to the rising interest rate environment, our balance sheet is very well positioned. We have minimal near-term exposure to raise the interest rates with 95% of our debt fixed across a weighted average maturity period of over nine years. And despite the recent increase in interest rates, the cost of oil remains at historically low levels, while we enjoy returns substantially higher than our multiples of cost to borrow and whack. Our financial strength continues to feel significant. And our balance sheet, fueled by our strong cash generation capabilities has great flexibility. Lastly, with regards to supply chain and the inflationary pressures in the marketplace, we've invested heavily in a sophisticated and forward leaning procurement and strategic sourcing organization. Allowing us to execute against a robust development pipeline across our platform, but continuing to deliver against our return expectations. This is not to say there isn't congestion in the supply chain. But we feel very well placed with our partners and suppliers resulting in limited delays against our expectations. To highlight that point, in the fourth quarter alone, we added 17 new projects to our IBX and xScale build program across 14 separate markets, while we completed seven projects across six markets. Now let me cover the highlights for the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q4 revenues were 1.706 billion up 10% over the same quarter last year and above the top end of our guidance range due to strong business performance led by the Americas. Consistent with our expectation, non-recurring revenue stepped down to 6% of total revenues in the quarter due to tiny and large customer installations. Interconnection revenues were 19% of recurring revenues with strong growth across all three regions, reflecting the continued benefit of our global platform and diversified product portfolio. Q4 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $5 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance range. Global Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $788 million, or 46% of revenues, up 11% over the same quarter last year and above the top end of our guidance range due to strong operating performance and timing of spend. Q4 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges included a $3 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and $5 million of integration costs. Global Q4 AFFO was $564 million in line with our expectations, while absorbing the anticipated and seasonally higher recurring capex investments similar to prior years. Q4 globally MRR churn was 2% at the bottom end of our targeted 2% to 2.5% range. Turning to our regional highlights, Q4 results were covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC and the Americas were the fastest MRR growing regions on a year-over-year normalized basis at 11% and 10% respectively. Followed by the EMEA region which stepped back up to 9% year-over-year growth as expected. The Americas region had another outstanding quarter delivering record bookings with robust channel activity, strong net positive pricing action and lower churn. The Americas momentum is broad based with 24/27 metros increasing gross bookings year-over-year, led by out Boston Denver, Mexico City, Los Angeles and in Toronto market. The Former Bell Canada assets continue to perform better than expected, in part due to increasing carrier and cloud deployments in a key Canadian markets. Our EMEA region had a solid quarter with strong retail bookings, like our U.K., Dutch and German businesses. Interestingly, we're seeing growing customer interest in this region given our sustainability efforts, including the recently signed DPPA with a wind farm developer in Finland to cover over 30 megawatts of capacity. And finally, the Asia-Pacific region had a solid quarter with strong pricing a new local activity. We're experiencing good momentum in India with a GPX is performing well above planning. Although Singapore remains capacity constrained, we welcome the government's recent decision to lift the moratorium on new data center business. Going forward new construction will need to deliver strategic value and international connectivity for Singapore's digital economy, but also needs to be at the forefront of sustainability. We feel extremely well positioned to deliver against the government's criteria. Now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. At the year end with unrestricted cash of approximately $1.5 billion a step up from last quarter due to strong operating cash flow, and approximately $400 million in ATM funding offset by our investments and the dividend payment. In early January, we renegotiated our line of credit providing us access to $4 billion of additional liquidity, while also increasing our financial flexibility on revenue revised covenant package. Looking forward, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to funding our growth consistent with our investment grade rating, while staying focused on creating long-term value for our shareholders. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $817 million including a recurring capex of $86 million. Our meaningful increase over the prior quarter as expected. We opened seven major projects since our last call including new IX in Genoa, Munich and Perth and a new eight xScale asset in Osaka. We also purchased land for development in Dublin and Istanbul. Revenues from own assets represent 59% of our recurring revenues. Our capital investments deliver strong returns as shown in Slide 10. Our now 158 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. The top end of our growth range as expected due to strong Americas growth. These stabilized assets are collectively 86% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PPD invested. And please refer to Slides 11 through 16 for updated summary of 2022 guidance and bridges. Who knows all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. And our guidance does not include the anticipated results from the pending close. The main one acquisition or any potential future capital market activities. Starting with revenues, for 2022 we expect top-line growth of 9% to 10% above the top end of our long-term rate, reflecting the continued momentum in the business. MRR churn is expected to remain within our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter. We expect 2022 adjusted EBITDA margins of across the 46% excluding integration costs. The result of strong operating leverage and efficiency initiatives in the business temporarily muted by the higher utility expenses. We expect to incur $20 million of integration costs in 2022 for our various acquisitions. 2022 AFFO is expected to grow 8% to 10% compared to previous year. And AFFO per share is expected growth 7% to 8%. 2022 capex is expected to be approximately $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion, including approximately $100 million of on balance sheet xScale spend which we expect to be reimbursed as we transfer these assets into the JV. And about $160 million of recurring capex spend. And finally, we expect our 2022 cash dividends increased to slightly greater than $1.1 billion, 10% increase over the prior year, or an 8% increase on a per share basis. So I'll stop here. And let me turn the call back to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thanks Keith. In closing, we're immensely pleased with the underlying performance of our business and are as optimistic as ever about the opportunity in front of us. Although the transitory effects from power pricing impact elements of our 2022 guidance, our normalized results would indicate a business trajectory that puts us meaningfully ahead of our Analyst Day expectations.

And let me stop there and open it up for questions.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Jordan Sadler, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJordan Sadler: Thank you. And good afternoon, first I would like to just touch on maybe some of the macro factors that you identified Keith, in your prepared remarks, first, just maybe on the margin impact related to the power costs that you're seeing in Singapore, I think you said it was 130 basis points impact year-over-year, but what specifically was the impact that you're seeing within the 46% margin related to Singapore? And then separately, can you maybe discuss how you might be dealing with any other exposures for example, in Europe, and if you were able to push through price increases to customers there to offset some of the exposure you might have had?\nCharles Meyers: Sure, hey Jordan it's Charles. Let me step back and give you some additional color on the power pricing dynamics. And then keeping that in bolt-on that we can sort of tag discussion on the broader inflationary aspects of the business as well. There's aspects of the power dynamics that are quite complex, but the net of it all is pretty easy to summarize. So other than Singapore, which I'll talk about, we continue to be really wellheads around the world. And our bridges show, you'll see there the impact of really the 130 bps which I'll touch on here in a minute. Other than that, we're really seeing limited margin impact from that in markets with higher volatility, we've really been able to offset the increased rates through a combination of some targeted price increases, which as we've talked about in the past, we have the contractual ability to pass through and offset a part also by strong operating leverage in the business, which we're very pleased about how that's materializing. But Singapore is clearly an outlier. Last Fall, as we looked at the historical trends in that market and other factors, we, alongside our power advisors, decided that we were going to defer on locking in Singapore. And we were pressing one, given the rates where the rates were at that time, and two given an ongoing negotiation of trying to get to a multi-year sort of hedge or locked position. Then really the fundamentals of the Singapore power market just dislocated, really driving an unprecedented level of volatility. And so counterparties weren't really able to offer rate lock, exposed temporarily to the spot rates and leaves us a bit out of sync with what customers are experiencing in the market. So that's where that exposure through the course of the year is what we're estimating at about 100 bps, then there's an additional 30 bps that on a year-over-year compare basis an impact of favorable dynamics from our Texas VPPA last year, and so the combination of those factors account for about the 130 bps on margin. So again, absent that, you'd be talking about a margin guide that 47 and change. And I think in the broader context, would really reflect a tremendous health of the business. So, that's where we are on the margin issue. And across the Rest of Europe, yes, there's volatility. As I said, we've sort of managed that through increasing, targeted price increases, in some cases, those price increases, we're going to phase them over a couple of years, because we feel like they're just too big to roll through and one plug, but again the pressure that we -- any pressure that we are seeing from that is being offset by nice operating leverage in the business. Keith, maybe you can comment on broader inflationary sort of factors in Europe and elsewhere?\nKeith Taylor: Yes, Jordan, when it comes to the inflation aspect, I just said, we've really invested heavily over the last couple of years in as I said, procurement and strategic sourcing team and work getting ahead of many of the inflationary issues. In some cases, we've bought substantial inventory that we're hosting, at the supplier of the partners location, and then we draw down on that over time.  So by locking in that commitment, we've been able to mitigate some of the inflationary risks that others might be experiencing. But to mention that we've got the supply available, where in some cases, others will not have the supply available, I think we've got a real good job locking it in, we're working on an extended basis over many years, we look forward with what our buying commitments are going to be over that time period. And that's another aspect of again, our increased sophistication around what we're doing, when and where and what we need when and where, and so the team is doing a good job of sourcing the larger material items for that. I'm going to say though, the other area that is probably a little bit more difficult to just the human capital side. And that's one of the greatest risks that you see all across the world and just sourcing humans not only to do the construction, but all the manufacturing. And so getting ahead all of that just means that you have to commit earlier than you might otherwise have done before so that you can get yourself in the appropriate queue in the manufacturing cycles. All that to say is I think we are in really good spot, we have seen limited delays thus far. Certainly prices have gone up in times in different sets of circumstances that Charles sort of alluded to, on his prior comment that we're putting through appropriate price increases into the marketplace, and it would depend solely on the market, but we're putting appropriate price increases into the market accordingly. And one of the things you've heard us say and I maybe I didn't, just to repeat it. This quarter again, we had meaningful net price positive pricing action, and I can't even think of the last time we talked about flat to negative pricing increases, so as an organization our pricing increases are more than offsetting our price decreases which has served us very well in our operating plan.\nJordan Sadler: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Rollins. Your line is open.\nCharles Meyers: Mike, are you there?\nOperator: We may have lost, Michael.\nCharles Meyers: Let us go to the next person in the queue, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Barden, Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Barden: Hey guys, thanks so much for taking the questions. Appreciate it. I guess two if I could. The first one maybe Charles, or Keith, you kind of highlighted some of the vertical strengths that we're seeing across different markets. I think what we're trying to get our arms around is, as we kind of come out post-pandemic and you've got this kind of global vision of where people who are still mired in COVID, are doing one thing, and maybe other economies are doing a new thing. Could you kind of elaborate a little bit on how we're watching the vertical demand evolve? What's going up? What's going down? And I guess the second question is now that we've got the Singapore Moratorium lifted, it did kind of put a spotlight on this progression towards kind of green power. Could you kind of comment on what, if any other geographies you see are kind of concerned about this issue. And obviously, you've been a leader on this, but I'd be interested to see what that leadership might be getting you from a demand standpoint? Thanks.\nCharles Meyers: Sure. David, I will take the first one, and then I think Keith, and maybe Kat can weigh in on the sustainability side as well, given she's so close to that, I will tell you that we're seeing just tremendous strength across the board really, in our verticals, essentially, because as I've looked at the last few scripts, it seems like every time we say we have strength somewhere else, so it's not like we're saying it. And as it relates to, and I think that's really driven by this, this really strong movement towards digital transformation, and people saying, hey, that is a critical source of competitive advantage, or at least keeping up. And they're making investments accordingly, and how they think about their infrastructure, how they think about their mix between cloud based workloads and private infrastructure, I think is really moving in ways that the wind is at our back. And I think the team has done a great job of articulating our relevance to those buyers. And, frankly, sales execution has been super strong. As it relates to COVID, I would tell you that we're not really it is, obviously, as you've seen, we are having ups and downs, and they're operationally challenging, so we are constantly dealing with sort of different mandates and mask mandates, and when we have to be doing sort of testing people, and when we're in the facilities, when we get an exposure dealing with that, et cetera. But the team has just done an amazing job on that. And I wouldn't say that I think we're seeing anywhere around the world that says, oh, they're kind of stuck in a pause mode due to COVID. People seem to be powering through that and saying, we got to move forward, regardless. And so I think we've seen really broad strength, Keith do you want to take the Singapore Moratorium and sustainability questions?\nKatrina Rymill: Yes, I'll kick that off. I'll tell you, David, we're very excited to see the moratorium lifted over in Singapore. That is actually one of our strongest markets. And it is a chance to highlight our focus on sustainability, you're seeing us really try to get in front of this, we're actually the first data center to announce a commitment to climate neutrality, which by 2030, we rolled out science based targets. Now underlying that is a very deep green program, whether it's enhancing our renewable energy coverage includes looking at areas like energy efficiency, which I am certain our investors are going to love as well, because there's returns around those projects, as well as just broadening our commitments and talking with customers. We've seen a huge uptick in customer outreach around this, we used to talk to about 50 customers a year, we're now up to a run rate of 1,000 customers reaching out asking for all sorts of data to help them really green their supply chain. So well, it certainly is getting a lot of focus around the world. And you believe it's an opportunity. And there's markets whether particularly the European markets are heavily focused on this. And you're seeing us react to certain areas, like in Germany, Germany is if you go to any of our new German sites, they all have green facades on front of them, as well as implementing new renewable energy coverage. So I think you'll see us continue to lean in heavily around this.\nCharles Meyers: Yes, one more comment, interestingly is a big deal for talent as well. Talent wants to be working for companies that they believe are committed to sustainability and are doing the right things and so and I think maybe that's unique or particularly true in the end. But we're seeing that across the board.\nDavid Barden: Awesome, all right, thank you guys. Really appreciate it.\nCharles Meyers: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. Can you hear me now?\nCharles Meyers: We can.\nMichael Rollins: Great, well, thanks for taking the questions, two if I could, first going back to the organic constant currency revenue guidance, I'm curious if you can just unpack some of the relative strength to the annual target, how much might be coming from some of the pricing actions, versus the pickup in demand for services or if there's any other areas of strength that we should be mindful of? And then the second question is for number of quarters now, you've been discussing the evolution in the contribution to logos and bookings from the indirect channel. And as you've had more experience with that channel, I'm curious, once the customers come in through that channel, how do they look relative to the customers that you get from your direct sales force? Are they adding services expanding or their different characteristics of their revenue lifecycle versus in indirect versus direct?\nCharles Meyers: Thanks, Mike. So on the organic constant currency guide, I would say, it's a combination factors, obviously there is a, we did say we're in a rising sort of price environment, but that's not a major factor, there's actually not a ton of that also, that is associated with price increases on the power front, there's some in there, but that's not a major factor. We are seeing obviously, digital services outpaced the broader business, but it's a small portion, right, I mean the broader and traditional core business is so big, that that's really the driving force. And so I point mostly to just momentum in the core business, I think we just continue to win, geographic expansion is going well, our acquisition assets are outperforming without exception. GPX is doing great, Bell is doing great, [indiscernible] is doing great. When we're building on that geographic advantage, we're selling into the hybrid and multicloud opportunity. And again, both customer demand is strong, and sales execution has been excellent, so I think it's driven mostly by I think the core, but we really are, but we're also excited about the trajectory and the momentum that we see. And in digital services, and how that's going to allow us to really respond to the evolving needs of the customer. In terms of channel, I would not say off the top my head a channel, channel acquired customer is meaningfully different, they often come in with a very solution oriented mindset, because typically, we're working with a channel partner who's already selling to that customer, something that he's done better at Equinix. And so they it's, I would say that the mix of business through the channel is quite good. So it's really in that sweet spot. And but they don't, I don't think they look meaningfully different. They all, I think they grow at newly acquired customers, writ large, grow faster. But that's true of both channel as well as non-channel customers. So I don't think they differ dramatically. But those we're going to continue to really look at that, in fact, it's one of the priorities for the year ahead is continuing to refine our segmentation, and make sure that we're delivering the right services to the right segments through the right channels and I think increased sort of sophistication on that front is going to continue to pay dividends both on the revenue line and the margin line.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Colby Synesael, Cowen and Company. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Michael on for Colby. Two questions, if I may. First we've seen key interconnect assets in Africa, namely Telco, get acquired by one of your peers. And there's also another large global data center company that's reportedly for sale, given you still have that incremental turn of leverage that you can deploy opportunistically and just wanted to get your latest thoughts on how you're thinking about M&A. And then also the second question you did 10% year-over-year, Americas growth in the fourth quarter, real acceleration there, just wondering what you would expect to see from that business in 2022? Thank you.\nCharles Meyers: On the M&A front, I guess what I say is, we continue to believe M&A is a very appropriate and powerful tool in the kit. We've been very successful at it, we're going to continue to look at it as an opportunity to extend our reach, scale our business in key markets and bring in critical interconnection assets. And so yes, we're actively involved in those processes, we're going to maintain a level of discipline on that, as we always do. And that means we're probably not going to win every deal. But it's really important, I think, particularly in markets with multiples that you could argue are overheated in the private markets to maintain that discipline. And in terms of the leverage, yes, we have that turn of leverage available that a lot of balance sheet flexibility, it's not burning a hole in our pockets. So we're happy to continue to have it and use it to drive the best returns in the business. And that's our capital allocation strategy is always to put it, where we think we can generate the best return. So, but I do expect M&A will be a piece of that puzzle, and I'm sure you'll hear more from us over the course of the year on that front. And as to the Americas, we don't guide on a regional basis. But what an incredible sort of momentum from that business over the last five or six quarters. And as we said, John Lin and team, your sales team and our ops team, and really the entire team just really strong execution, super excited to take John's immense capabilities and apply them more broadly across the business. But I think you're going to see, I do think that, this digital transformation demand is following sort of a typical pattern, really strong demand in America, and then emerging in other areas across the world. And we see that profile. And so but as you look at it this quarter is pretty interesting in the 10% in the America, 11% in APAC, 9% in Europe. Pretty darn strong across the board and nice rebound in Europe. And we're beginning to lap some of the -- some of the prior year increases that we saw there. And so, I think that -- I think we're really seeing strong across the board. But I do expect continued momentum in the Americas.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thanks for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Del Deo, MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nNick Del Deo: Hi, thanks for taking my question, guys. Two for you. Maybe one for Charles and one for Keith. First, as alluded to a moment ago, we've seen a few deals happen in Africa recently, most notably you buying main one and digital buying Teraco? I'm sure you looked at all of them, maybe some of that didn't even trade? Why was main one the best asset for Equinix? And is there a path for catching up with Teraco in South Africa over time? And then for Keith, on recurring capex? It seems like it's going to be at the very low end of your target range in 2022. And it's been towards the lower end for a few years now. Should we expect, that to pick up in coming years? Or is this kind of a new normal for recurring capex?\nCharles Meyers: Del let me take Africa and then I'll hand it over to Keith on the recurring capex side. Look at -- we continue to believe Africa's very attractive long-term market it is definitely more it is one that's going to evolve over many years. And we're active in that market, as you know, and I wouldn't drawn any -- draw any specific comparisons between deals, because I think they provide different value. But we're -- I'll say we're very excited about main one. And we think it's a great sort of Cornerstone to build from. Teraco is a great asset. It's a great team and a good business. And we're going to continue -- and South Africa is an important market. And so that one didn't go our way. And we're going to -- we're going to find in what we're going to continue to be we're committed to competing that market is South Africa has to be a part of any thoughtful African strategy. And there's a variety of other paths for us in that market. And we're hard at work ethic. And then Keith will take the recurring cap return.\nKeith Taylor: And so it\u2019s another recurring capex. We are -- as we tend to we are the sort of lower end of the range for fiscal year '22. Quite a bit, just timing, Nick, and recognizing that you, depending on what we have coming into the portfolio, it's going to dictate so the timing of the capex. So that'd be one thing. And so there, you saw an elevated Q4 number of roughly 5%. Recurring capex relative to revenue and steps down of course, in Q1 and then as we look through the year, it is roughly somewhere between 2% and 3%. But I think the biggest thing is really about timing and the number of new assets that we're bringing into the portfolio and as a result, when you think about the level of recurring capex that has to be made, the newer the portfolio, the better position you have in the current campaign. I would continue to model 2% to 3%, it feels like a reasonable approach, and we'll continue to guide you accordingly. But in fairness to your long-term model, I think that that would be a fair point.\nNick Del Deo: Okay, great. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Atkin, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJohn Atkin: Yes, a couple of kind of EBITDA questions or related questions, and then one on xScale. So I was just interested in what are the churn expectations that are embedded in your 2022 guidance? And then noting the drop in Europe and EBITDA? What are some of the factors that drove that? And how can we think about the margin development by region? And what are those special items to kind of keep be mindful on?\nKeith Taylor: Well, I think as it relates to churn first and foremost, as I said, in the prepared remarks, churn for the business was 2.1%, on average per quarter for 2021. 2%, in the fourth quarter, which was great. In many ways, Charles sort of alluded to in his comments on revenue, part of the reason the revenues were so strong is, and I like to say, there's no pass through rates to our revenue dollar than these eliminating churn. And churn was a very, very low level. As we look into 2022, there's not going to be a meaningful shift. We've gotten used to that sort of the range of 2% to 2.5%, that's indicative of what we think will happen. I think the midpoint is probably a fair approach at this stage. And we'll continue to update you on it. But there's nothing meaningful that -- there's nothing meaningful, that will guide you differently at this point, John. As it relates to European EBITDA, there's a number of things that are going on in Q3 one example, is just the timing of costs more specifically, but if you look at the implications of Q4 relative to Q3, there's a German power rebates in the third quarter, until we -- you'll add that into the fourth quarter, and then you've got higher seasonal costs in q4, particularly with the winter months in Europe, you've got higher utility consumption. And so as a result, it has an impact on the margin, when you look at it more specifically. And then there was just some services and an increase hiring costs in the quarter, but there was nothing fundamentally different about your going on. And overall, our belief is the trajectory to our target of 50% EBITDA margins. We're still well on that path notwithstanding, the comments that Charles made related to Asian power, that's going to be very much a transitory matter. And we'll get the other side of that would probably by the second half of the year.\nJohn Atkin: And then, on xScale, just curious, any update on your kind of capex and growth assumptions, pricing assumptions as well, given the hyperscale demand that we've seen in the sector, as well as the high level of investment seen by a number of competing platforms? Just curious how you view hyper scale demand pricing, and then your level of participation in terms of CapEx?\nCharles Meyers: Yes, John, we've seen some increases in build costs, but we're striving to offset those one by just continuing to be accretive on the design front, and continuing to sort of design, try to get some of those out from a design perspective. And then also on the sourcing front, and really working on the strategic sourcing side. So we're, and I think we're seeing returns relatively stable. I think, pricing is aggressive, but stable. I think that there -- yes, there is plenty of supply in the market, but there's even more demand. So I would say, I think, supply demand is quite balanced in the xScale realm right now. It's very chunky and very market specific. And so it's a little bit different than our retail business. But as you've seen our uptake, in lease up has been super strong, thus far, I mean teams executed really well. And we feel good about that. And so there's a lot of megawatts coming down the road and a lot of customer demand. So it's an exciting time, I think for xScale, and we're pleased with the performance of that piece of the business. And that, I mean, it's important to just remind everybody that our exposure on the capital side is, we have gearing of 10 to one on that capex, right. So, because we're only 20% of it, and there's always leverage involved there. And so it really allows us to have a relatively modest overall exposure to that capital and so. So we're putting the bulk of our capital to work on the retail side with really stronger John.\nJohn Atkin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simon Flannery, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. Good evening. I wonder if I could come back to the margin question. You talked a couple of times about margin trends improving the second half of '22, perhaps just to help us with what gives you the visibility into that? Is that mostly Singapore? And how much clarity you have there? And then you reiterated the 50% from by 2025? So given the move here on '22? Do we see it going up fairly linearly from '23 through to '25? Are there other puts and takes there, as we think about that goal long-term goal?\nCharles Meyers: Yes, well, what I would say yes, the big factor on the margin profile in 2022 is Singapore, as I said, 100 bps of that, and you have 30 bps associated with the year-over-year compared on the benefits we got from the vPPA last year. And so that's the bulk of it, I mean, you can see in the bridge, there's 1.4 there a margin in step down, 1.3 of that is explained between those two factors. And so there's not the rest is a series of puts and takes with some expenses and investments and really solid operating leverage in the business. And so I would say, it is mitigating the sandboard impact. It is operating the driving operating leverage in the business, which is going to be a key focus for John and the team, and it continues to drive the scale on the business. And then a strong pricing environment. So I think we're continuing to see a solid pricing environment, we've demonstrated our ability to deliver distinctive value our customers. And so as the prices were -- I mean, as some of the inflation goes, we're going to go ahead and offset that some degree on the pricing. So I think all those factors, sort of will lead us to some solid progression there from margin standpoint. And I wouldn't guide on where it goes from there and how linear it is or not. I think it's going to, we're going to make judgments in the business, as we always do about investments and how to maximize long-term value creation. But I think what you heard loud and clear is a level of confidence on our part about the 50% target. And again, as we really dug in hard, which is to some degree, the Singapore dynamic was a real catalyst for us to do. It gave us I think an increased level of confidence about how operating leverage is materializing. And that gives us confidence to sort of reiterate that 50% by 2025.\nSimon Flannery: Great, thank you.\nCharles Meyers: Thanks Simon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sami Badri, Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nSami Badri: Hi, thank you very much for the question. I'm looking at your same-store growth. And that definitely came in a little bit above people's expectations. And I'm trying to take some of your prior comments where you talked about if there was no Singapore utility impact, you would probably grow or be able to comment adjusted EBITDA margins of 47% and change. And this is making me think about the long-term picture on the road to 50%. The same-store has to grow a 5% plus for you to get to 50% adjusted EBITDA margin long-term by 2025. Or can you just maybe unpack that growth rate or that vector for us?\nCharles Meyers: Sure. Yes. I don't think the short answer is no. We said, we've typically guided in 3% to 5% on the recurring revenue range. Obviously really pleased with 5% up into that range for the stabilized assets. They move around a little bit depending on a variety of factors, but I think overall, we're continuing as business, churns in those markets. We're replacing it with a strong, sort of sweet spot business, continuing to drive interconnection, continuing to expand fabric into more locations, that drives more interconnection. And so I think that's going to drive good results. But I don't think that's it, I don't think, it's incumbent on us to have that happen to get to the 50%. I think there's a variety of sources of operating leverage in our business as we examine our ability to simplify, automate, digitize our business that I think will give us the trajectory that we need on the -- to get to that 50%.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Ari Klein, BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAriKlein: Thank you. Charles, you mentioned some of the challenges in the hedging in Singapore, as you look at other markets, where energy prices are elevated, and hedges roll off. Are you hedging at these higher prices? And just you also mentioned passing on some of those costs? What has been the response on the customer side from that?\nCharles Meyers: Yes, look, I mean, undoubtedly, customers aren't excited about it. But it is, it is the reality that, and it's different. The reality is in deregulated markets, everybody's in the same boat. We're all exposed to the regulated rate. And if the rate rises more than a certain percentage, our contracts allow us to pass that through. And that's the baseline expectation of the customer. And so while they may not love it, they -- that's just an expectation. I think, in deregulated markets, it's a little more complex, we've have these multi-year hedges, which essentially allow you to dampen volatility, and adapt to in a rising rate environment more gradually. And so that's typically what we've seen. That's the way hedging works in a, you're either, you're kind of chasing it down or following it up, because your hedges work either a plus or minus around a range. And so I think we're going to be implementing it gradually over time, as hedges roll off, and sort of hedging into the new market rates, as we roll those hedges out into future years. So, and it's important to remember, we've been doing this for many, many years. And so it's not really a new dynamic, there are definitely some markets that were more volatile and more spiky. And then you have to make a judgement about if that if your rate increase and the potential price increase that if the price increase, you reflect something that doesn't feel right, from a long-term customer relationship standpoint, and we always take the long lens on our customer relationships, then we'll adjust accordingly. And that could mean that we have some pressure from that. But as you see in the bridges, we've been able to offset that with other operating leverage. And so we expect that to continue to be the case, this is an area where the scope and the scale of our business really helps us. And so yes, there are factors out there that we have to deal with, and we deal with them carefully and with the customer in mind. And I think as you can see, we feel confident that we'll be able to manage through it.\nAriKlein: Got it. And are those price increases permanent, so if I guess if pricing or energy costs normalized, can that turn into a tailwind from your standpoint?\nCharles Meyers: Yes, very good question. Here's what I'd say, there's different types of price increases, we're actually implementing some baseline sort of new pricing for new deals, because of a broader set of inflationary characteristics and a deep confidence in the value that we deliver to customers. Those I view as more structural. But then in other markets, there are more temporal pricing adjustments associated directly with the utility, volatility, and I wouldn't expect those to be permanent. If it retrenches, then we would want to give that back to the customer. So we are -- but we've been hedged, our hedging strategy allows us to really dampen that volatility out typically, we have definitely seen more volatility, so I wouldn't say we're going to just think regardless of what happens power prices in future. But I do think that for all those and I do think there is a level of them that are more -- level of those that are more structural in terms of new price points on new deals.\nAriKlein: Got it, thank you.\nCharles Meyers: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our Q4 call. Thank you for joining us.",

To that end, we continue to expand on our global footprint with 41 major projects underway across 28 metros in 19 countries, representing over 20,000 cabinets of retail, and over 80 megawatts of xScale capacity. We remain focused on simplifying, automating and digitizing our services, allowing us to scale our business and enhance operating leverage. And we're already seeing the results of these efforts. For example, we recently launched our new Secure Cab Express product, leveraging pre-deployed capacity to dramatically reduce cycle times and enable online quoting and ordering for our most commonly requested configurations. We expect to roll this new service out to customers in the coming quarters, driving increased customer responsiveness while simultaneously enhancing margins. Our global interconnection franchise continues to perform well and we now have over 419,000 interconnections on our industry leading platform. In Q4, we added an incremental 7,500 organic interconnections as enterprises drive growth and further enhance our ecosystem density. Internet exchange saw peak traffic of 6% quarter-over-quarter and 27% year-over-year, with peak traffic in APAC surpassing 10 terabits per second, for the first time as service providers increasingly look to IX to improve Internet traffic delivery. Turning to digital infrastructure services, cloud computing has permanently reshaped customer expectations for speed and simplicity. Customers want to deploy infrastructure where they want it, when they want it seamlessly integrating cloud based workloads and private infrastructure and enabling agility and performance between the two. As a result, customers are embracing a broader set of our services, combining fabric, metal and network edge to build virtual points of presence. And our plan expansions will fully enable this capability across 30 markets by the end of 2022. For the quarter, Equinix Fabric saw excellent growth eclipsing $150 million in revenue run rate with a third of our customers now using Fabric for a variety of use cases across a broad set of destinations. Our Equinix Metal business delivered strong results with a great mix of wins and new logos across verticals at a healthy backlog. And network edge saw continued traction with growth from new and existing customers, as they use the service to implement WAN optimization and cloud-to-cloud routing. Shifting to xScale, in January we announced plans to expand xScale into South Korea with an agreement to establish a $525 million joint venture with GIC to develop two data centers installed. Total investment in our various hyperscale joint ventures when closed and fully built out is now expected to be more than $8 billion across 36 facilities globally, with more than 720 megawatts of power capacity. We currently have nine xScale bills under development and during the quarter, we fully leased the first phase of our Frankfurt 11 asset and the first and second phases of our Sao Paulo 5 assets representing approximately 20 megawatts of capacity. So xScale leasing is now over 130 megawatts and our initial JV at EMEA is over 80% leased. Now let me cover some of the highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical had solid bookings quarter with healthy new logo activity led by the Americas as companies expand and optimize digital capabilities to support the delivery and consumption of data at the edge. New wins and expansions included a Fortune 200 telecom company deploying infrastructure to support the U.S. first cloud native Open RAN-based 5G network. Inligo Networks, an Australian cable systems operator deploying digital infrastructure to support a new subsea cable across Southeast Asia, Australia and the U.S. and an African local telco, deploying a network hub in Lisbon to improve pairing and performance. Our enterprise virtual saw another quarter of record bookings, as IDC predicts almost half of the global economy will be based on or influenced by digital in 2022, fueling strong demand for hybrid infrastructure. Q4 had particular strength in FinTech, industrial services and energy sub segments with wins and expansions, including NASDAQ, a Fortune 500 technology company, scaling its cloud enabled infrastructure to deliver ultra low latency Edge compute capabilities from our NY11 data center in Carteret. Avaya, cloud communications and workstream collaboration company implementing an Edge data center strategy on platform Equinix to streamline private connectivity for its customers and ADT, U.S. leading smart home security provider embracing the cloud with an infrastructure modernization effort spanning multiple geographies. Our cloud and IT services vertical offset solid bookings this quarter led by the software and infrastructure sub segments, with good momentum in EMEA and APAC. The expansions included Zscaler, a leading Global 2000 Security cloud provider, upgrading capacity for sustainable enterprise cloud transformation, and growing network traffic at the Edge. Wiz Technologies, a Singaporean full-suite IT service provider, deploying on Equinix Metal and upgrading Fabric services to support quick and seamless business expansion. And Oracle, a top five global software provider deploying FastConnect Cloud on-ramps to support new regions in Singapore, Milan and Stockholm, bringing their total number of on-ramps available at Equinix to 24 more than any of their other partners. Our content digital media vertical has strong wins led by the publishing and digital media sub segments and record channel activity. Expansions included Cloudflare, the U.S. based global web infrastructure and security company upgrading and expanding their footprint in over 40 markets. Index Exchange, global ad tech marketplace, expanding compute nodes in APAC demanded traffic growth, and a top three global credit agency deploying regional network in cloud hubs in APAC to support its operations. Our channel program delivered a record quarter to close the year accounting for 40% of bookings and nearly 60% of new logos. And we have line of sight for channels to grow to 50% of our bookings in the coming years as we enhance our systems and processes, and leverage our diverse set of partners to scale our reach. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals, and use cases with continued strength from strategic partners like Microsoft, Dell, Cisco, Google and BT, including a significant win with Wipro and AT&T, helping a utility company modernize its IT infrastructure, Europe and the U.S. So now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter.

            "name": "Charles Meyers",
            "content": "Thanks, Katrina. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. We had a great finish to the year with our best booking performance ever driven by an exceptional demand backdrop for our business with continued strength across our platform, but more specifically in the Americas low churn and continued momentum in our digital services portfolio. For the full-year, we achieved over $6.6 billion of revenue, marking our 76 consecutive quarter top line increases and amazing 19 years of continuous revenue growth while driving attractive AFFO per share to the bottom line. Amidst the dynamic and complex global landscape, we continue to deliver against our vision and our fiscal year results demonstrate both the increasing relevance of our platform and our uniquely differentiated value proposition. Businesses globally continue to prioritize digital transformation as a foundational source of competitive advantage and the secular drivers for our business have never been stronger, as digital leaders demand infrastructure that is more distributed, more ecosystem powered, more flexible, more sustainable and more interconnected than ever before. Increasingly, Equinix represents a critical point of Nexus customers implement hybrid and multi cloud as a clear architecture of choice. And as a global market leader, we continue to innovate and expand our portfolio to respond to these evolving customer demands, and capture the enormous opportunity ahead. As we look to 2022, the trajectory and underlying momentum in our business is exceptionally strong, with a solid demand pipeline, stable churn and a rising price trend, resulting in a revenue outlook for the year that is at or above the high end of our long-term guidance range. And an AFFO per share outlook is still within our long-term guidance range, despite pressure at the gross margin line associated with power price volatility in Singapore. Absent these specific dynamics our underlying business performance will be producing AFFO per share growth towards the high-end of our Analyst Day guidance well ahead of our expectations. We have a robust global power hedging program [indiscernible] and we expect will continue to be highly effective in smoothing utility price volatility over the years, providing predictability and value across markets for Equinix and our customers. We believe the current dislocation in Singapore is transitory with higher prices showing signs of moderating in the second half of the year. Bottom line, the business is performing very well. And we remain on track to meeting or exceeding our Analyst Day objectives for both top line revenue and AFFO per share growth and as we see the temporary headwinds moderate, and continue to realize efficiency gains from prior-year investments, we have a strong resolve and continued confidence in our ability to scale adjusted EBITDA margins to 50% by 2025. Turning to our results as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for the full-year were $6.6 billion up 8% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA was also up 8% year-over-year, and AFFO per share grew 9% year-over-year. Interconnection revenues for the current quarter grew 12% year-over-year with solid unit ads reflecting strong momentum with Equinix Fabric as expanding use cases drive connections to more locations and more counterparties. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our global reach remains as important as ever. IDC predicts that by 2025, more than 50% of enterprise data will be generated at the edge, and customers continue to see Equinix as the best manifestation of the digital edge. This competitive differentiation continues to drive our business, with revenues from multi-region customers increasing 1% quarter-over-quarter to an impressive 75%. In December, we announced our long awaited entry into Africa with our intended acquisition of MainOne, a leading West African data center and connectivity solutions provider with a presence in Nigeria, Ghana and the Ivory Coast, set to close in early Q2. Thanks Keith. In closing, we're immensely pleased with the underlying performance of our business and are as optimistic as ever about the opportunity in front of us. Although the transitory effects from power pricing impact elements of our 2022 guidance, our normalized results would indicate a business trajectory that puts us meaningfully ahead of our Analyst Day expectations. We continue to work hard to further mitigate the end year impacts of the Singapore car volatility. And in parallel, intend to continue to strengthen our market leading position as the world digital infrastructure company by scaling and transforming our data center business, while also accelerating our digital services business to deliver on the promise of physical infrastructure at software speed. And we intend to continue to advance a bold ESG agenda, addressing the urgency of climate change with a commitment to climate neutrality by 2030. And fostering a culture in workplace where every person every day can confidently say I'm safe, I belong and I matter. Of note, we were thrilled to recently receive a perfect score from the Human Rights Campaign and be recognized as a best place to work for LGBTQ plus quality. And are proud to be ranked number one in real estate in JUST Capitals 2022 rankings of America's most JUST companies. Overall nearly 25 year history, we have created and cultivated a foundational set of advantages to period lower reach, now expanding 66 metros in 27 countries. Advantage access to the world's most powerful digital ecosystems with more than 10,000 customers, and over half the Fortune 500, the world's most comprehensive and advanced interconnection platform, and a track record of service excellence that gives our customers the peace of mind they deserve. These advantages are strongly aligned to market trends and nearly impossible to duplicate. A dynamic that continues to feel strong growth and a rapidly expanding addressable market that we are confident will translate to compelling long-term value creation. As we strive to fulfill our purpose, to be the platform where the world comes together, enabling the innovations that enrich our work, our life in our planet. We will continue to show up every day remaining in service to our stakeholders. To each other, to our customers, to our communities, and to you, our shareholders. And let me stop there and open it up for questions. Sure, hey Jordan it's Charles. Let me step back and give you some additional color on the power pricing dynamics. And then keeping that in bolt-on that we can sort of tag discussion on the broader inflationary aspects of the business as well. There's aspects of the power dynamics that are quite complex, but the net of it all is pretty easy to summarize. So other than Singapore, which I'll talk about, we continue to be really wellheads around the world. And our bridges show, you'll see there the impact of really the 130 bps which I'll touch on here in a minute. Other than that, we're really seeing limited margin impact from that in markets with higher volatility, we've really been able to offset the increased rates through a combination of some targeted price increases, which as we've talked about in the past, we have the contractual ability to pass through and offset a part also by strong operating leverage in the business, which we're very pleased about how that's materializing. But Singapore is clearly an outlier. Last Fall, as we looked at the historical trends in that market and other factors, we, alongside our power advisors, decided that we were going to defer on locking in Singapore. And we were pressing one, given the rates where the rates were at that time, and two given an ongoing negotiation of trying to get to a multi-year sort of hedge or locked position. Then really the fundamentals of the Singapore power market just dislocated, really driving an unprecedented level of volatility. And so counterparties weren't really able to offer rate lock, exposed temporarily to the spot rates and leaves us a bit out of sync with what customers are experiencing in the market. So that's where that exposure through the course of the year is what we're estimating at about 100 bps, then there's an additional 30 bps that on a year-over-year compare basis an impact of favorable dynamics from our Texas VPPA last year, and so the combination of those factors account for about the 130 bps on margin. So again, absent that, you'd be talking about a margin guide that 47 and change. And I think in the broader context, would really reflect a tremendous health of the business. So, that's where we are on the margin issue. And across the Rest of Europe, yes, there's volatility. As I said, we've sort of managed that through increasing, targeted price increases, in some cases, those price increases, we're going to phase them over a couple of years, because we feel like they're just too big to roll through and one plug, but again the pressure that we -- any pressure that we are seeing from that is being offset by nice operating leverage in the business. Keith, maybe you can comment on broader inflationary sort of factors in Europe and elsewhere? Mike, are you there? Let us go to the next person in the queue, please. Sure. David, I will take the first one, and then I think Keith, and maybe Kat can weigh in on the sustainability side as well, given she's so close to that, I will tell you that we're seeing just tremendous strength across the board really, in our verticals, essentially, because as I've looked at the last few scripts, it seems like every time we say we have strength somewhere else, so it's not like we're saying it. And as it relates to, and I think that's really driven by this, this really strong movement towards digital transformation, and people saying, hey, that is a critical source of competitive advantage, or at least keeping up. And they're making investments accordingly, and how they think about their infrastructure, how they think about their mix between cloud based workloads and private infrastructure, I think is really moving in ways that the wind is at our back. And I think the team has done a great job of articulating our relevance to those buyers. And, frankly, sales execution has been super strong. As it relates to COVID, I would tell you that we're not really it is, obviously, as you've seen, we are having ups and downs, and they're operationally challenging, so we are constantly dealing with sort of different mandates and mask mandates, and when we have to be doing sort of testing people, and when we're in the facilities, when we get an exposure dealing with that, et cetera. But the team has just done an amazing job on that. And I wouldn't say that I think we're seeing anywhere around the world that says, oh, they're kind of stuck in a pause mode due to COVID. People seem to be powering through that and saying, we got to move forward, regardless. And so I think we've seen really broad strength, Keith do you want to take the Singapore Moratorium and sustainability questions? Yes, one more comment, interestingly is a big deal for talent as well. Talent wants to be working for companies that they believe are committed to sustainability and are doing the right things and so and I think maybe that's unique or particularly true in the end. But we're seeing that across the board. Okay. We can. Thanks, Mike. So on the organic constant currency guide, I would say, it's a combination factors, obviously there is a, we did say we're in a rising sort of price environment, but that's not a major factor, there's actually not a ton of that also, that is associated with price increases on the power front, there's some in there, but that's not a major factor. We are seeing obviously, digital services outpaced the broader business, but it's a small portion, right, I mean the broader and traditional core business is so big, that that's really the driving force. And so I point mostly to just momentum in the core business, I think we just continue to win, geographic expansion is going well, our acquisition assets are outperforming without exception. GPX is doing great, Bell is doing great, [indiscernible] is doing great. When we're building on that geographic advantage, we're selling into the hybrid and multicloud opportunity. And again, both customer demand is strong, and sales execution has been excellent, so I think it's driven mostly by I think the core, but we really are, but we're also excited about the trajectory and the momentum that we see. And in digital services, and how that's going to allow us to really respond to the evolving needs of the customer. In terms of channel, I would not say off the top my head a channel, channel acquired customer is meaningfully different, they often come in with a very solution oriented mindset, because typically, we're working with a channel partner who's already selling to that customer, something that he's done better at Equinix. And so they it's, I would say that the mix of business through the channel is quite good. So it's really in that sweet spot. And but they don't, I don't think they look meaningfully different. They all, I think they grow at newly acquired customers, writ large, grow faster. But that's true of both channel as well as non-channel customers. So I don't think they differ dramatically. But those we're going to continue to really look at that, in fact, it's one of the priorities for the year ahead is continuing to refine our segmentation, and make sure that we're delivering the right services to the right segments through the right channels and I think increased sort of sophistication on that front is going to continue to pay dividends both on the revenue line and the margin line. On the M&A front, I guess what I say is, we continue to believe M&A is a very appropriate and powerful tool in the kit. We've been very successful at it, we're going to continue to look at it as an opportunity to extend our reach, scale our business in key markets and bring in critical interconnection assets. And so yes, we're actively involved in those processes, we're going to maintain a level of discipline on that, as we always do. And that means we're probably not going to win every deal. But it's really important, I think, particularly in markets with multiples that you could argue are overheated in the private markets to maintain that discipline. And in terms of the leverage, yes, we have that turn of leverage available that a lot of balance sheet flexibility, it's not burning a hole in our pockets. So we're happy to continue to have it and use it to drive the best returns in the business. And that's our capital allocation strategy is always to put it, where we think we can generate the best return. So, but I do expect M&A will be a piece of that puzzle, and I'm sure you'll hear more from us over the course of the year on that front. And as to the Americas, we don't guide on a regional basis. But what an incredible sort of momentum from that business over the last five or six quarters. And as we said, John Lin and team, your sales team and our ops team, and really the entire team just really strong execution, super excited to take John's immense capabilities and apply them more broadly across the business. But I think you're going to see, I do think that, this digital transformation demand is following sort of a typical pattern, really strong demand in America, and then emerging in other areas across the world. And we see that profile. And so but as you look at it this quarter is pretty interesting in the 10% in the America, 11% in APAC, 9% in Europe. Pretty darn strong across the board and nice rebound in Europe. And we're beginning to lap some of the -- some of the prior year increases that we saw there. And so, I think that -- I think we're really seeing strong across the board. But I do expect continued momentum in the Americas. Del let me take Africa and then I'll hand it over to Keith on the recurring capex side. Look at -- we continue to believe Africa's very attractive long-term market it is definitely more it is one that's going to evolve over many years. And we're active in that market, as you know, and I wouldn't drawn any -- draw any specific comparisons between deals, because I think they provide different value. But we're -- I'll say we're very excited about main one. And we think it's a great sort of Cornerstone to build from. Teraco is a great asset. It's a great team and a good business. And we're going to continue -- and South Africa is an important market. And so that one didn't go our way. And we're going to -- we're going to find in what we're going to continue to be we're committed to competing that market is South Africa has to be a part of any thoughtful African strategy. And there's a variety of other paths for us in that market. And we're hard at work ethic. And then Keith will take the recurring cap return. Yes, John, we've seen some increases in build costs, but we're striving to offset those one by just continuing to be accretive on the design front, and continuing to sort of design, try to get some of those out from a design perspective. And then also on the sourcing front, and really working on the strategic sourcing side. So we're, and I think we're seeing returns relatively stable. I think, pricing is aggressive, but stable. I think that there -- yes, there is plenty of supply in the market, but there's even more demand. So I would say, I think, supply demand is quite balanced in the xScale realm right now. It's very chunky and very market specific. And so it's a little bit different than our retail business. But as you've seen our uptake, in lease up has been super strong, thus far, I mean teams executed really well. And we feel good about that. And so there's a lot of megawatts coming down the road and a lot of customer demand. So it's an exciting time, I think for xScale, and we're pleased with the performance of that piece of the business. And that, I mean, it's important to just remind everybody that our exposure on the capital side is, we have gearing of 10 to one on that capex, right. So, because we're only 20% of it, and there's always leverage involved there. And so it really allows us to have a relatively modest overall exposure to that capital and so. So we're putting the bulk of our capital to work on the retail side with really stronger John. Yes, well, what I would say yes, the big factor on the margin profile in 2022 is Singapore, as I said, 100 bps of that, and you have 30 bps associated with the year-over-year compared on the benefits we got from the vPPA last year. And so that's the bulk of it, I mean, you can see in the bridge, there's 1.4 there a margin in step down, 1.3 of that is explained between those two factors. And so there's not the rest is a series of puts and takes with some expenses and investments and really solid operating leverage in the business. And so I would say, it is mitigating the sandboard impact. It is operating the driving operating leverage in the business, which is going to be a key focus for John and the team, and it continues to drive the scale on the business. And then a strong pricing environment. So I think we're continuing to see a solid pricing environment, we've demonstrated our ability to deliver distinctive value our customers. And so as the prices were -- I mean, as some of the inflation goes, we're going to go ahead and offset that some degree on the pricing. So I think all those factors, sort of will lead us to some solid progression there from margin standpoint. And I wouldn't guide on where it goes from there and how linear it is or not. I think it's going to, we're going to make judgments in the business, as we always do about investments and how to maximize long-term value creation. But I think what you heard loud and clear is a level of confidence on our part about the 50% target. And again, as we really dug in hard, which is to some degree, the Singapore dynamic was a real catalyst for us to do. It gave us I think an increased level of confidence about how operating leverage is materializing. And that gives us confidence to sort of reiterate that 50% by 2025. Thanks Simon. Sure. Yes. I don't think the short answer is no. We said, we've typically guided in 3% to 5% on the recurring revenue range. Obviously really pleased with 5% up into that range for the stabilized assets. They move around a little bit depending on a variety of factors, but I think overall, we're continuing as business, churns in those markets. We're replacing it with a strong, sort of sweet spot business, continuing to drive interconnection, continuing to expand fabric into more locations, that drives more interconnection. And so I think that's going to drive good results. But I don't think that's it, I don't think, it's incumbent on us to have that happen to get to the 50%. I think there's a variety of sources of operating leverage in our business as we examine our ability to simplify, automate, digitize our business that I think will give us the trajectory that we need on the -- to get to that 50%. Yes, look, I mean, undoubtedly, customers aren't excited about it. But it is, it is the reality that, and it's different. The reality is in deregulated markets, everybody's in the same boat. We're all exposed to the regulated rate. And if the rate rises more than a certain percentage, our contracts allow us to pass that through. And that's the baseline expectation of the customer. And so while they may not love it, they -- that's just an expectation. I think, in deregulated markets, it's a little more complex, we've have these multi-year hedges, which essentially allow you to dampen volatility, and adapt to in a rising rate environment more gradually. And so that's typically what we've seen. That's the way hedging works in a, you're either, you're kind of chasing it down or following it up, because your hedges work either a plus or minus around a range. And so I think we're going to be implementing it gradually over time, as hedges roll off, and sort of hedging into the new market rates, as we roll those hedges out into future years. So, and it's important to remember, we've been doing this for many, many years. And so it's not really a new dynamic, there are definitely some markets that were more volatile and more spiky. And then you have to make a judgement about if that if your rate increase and the potential price increase that if the price increase, you reflect something that doesn't feel right, from a long-term customer relationship standpoint, and we always take the long lens on our customer relationships, then we'll adjust accordingly. And that could mean that we have some pressure from that. But as you see in the bridges, we've been able to offset that with other operating leverage. And so we expect that to continue to be the case, this is an area where the scope and the scale of our business really helps us. And so yes, there are factors out there that we have to deal with, and we deal with them carefully and with the customer in mind. And I think as you can see, we feel confident that we'll be able to manage through it. Yes, very good question. Here's what I'd say, there's different types of price increases, we're actually implementing some baseline sort of new pricing for new deals, because of a broader set of inflationary characteristics and a deep confidence in the value that we deliver to customers. Those I view as more structural. But then in other markets, there are more temporal pricing adjustments associated directly with the utility, volatility, and I wouldn't expect those to be permanent. If it retrenches, then we would want to give that back to the customer. So we are -- but we've been hedged, our hedging strategy allows us to really dampen that volatility out typically, we have definitely seen more volatility, so I wouldn't say we're going to just think regardless of what happens power prices in future. But I do think that for all those and I do think there is a level of them that are more -- level of those that are more structural in terms of new price points on new deals. You bet."

At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thanks, Kat. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We had a great quarter, achieving our 75th consecutive quarter of top line revenue growth and a record Q3. A clear signal of strong market demand. Our results were fueled by continued strength in our Americas business and robust performance for our channel program globally as key partners continue to see Platform Equinix as a point of nexus for digital transformations solutions. The pandemic has triggered and accelerated need to digitize business models in virtually every segment of the economy. And our strong results reflect its increasing demand for digital infrastructure and Equinix remains uniquely positioned to help customers as they shift towards distributed, hybrid, and multi-cloud as clear architecture of choice. As we continue to strengthen our position as the world digital infrastructure Company, our focus remains on creating distinctive and durable value for our customers and our shareholders, driving growth in scale and our market-leading colocation franchise, expanding our relevance in Cloud ecosystem through xScale, and tapping into massive sources of incremental demand by adapting to evolving customer needs with our rapidly growing digital services business. Turning to our results as depicted on Slide 3. Revenues for Q3 were $1.7 million, up 8% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA was up 4% year-over-year, and the AFFO was in line with our expectations. Interconnection revenues continued to outpace colocation revenues, growing 11% year-over-year, driven by solid fiscal cross connect growth and broad adoption of Equinix power. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. We process more than 4,200 yields in the quarter across more than 3,100 customers highlighting the reach, scale and predictability of our booking digits. We have a solid demand pipeline as we look in the final quarter of the year, and we continue to add capacity in services demand with 11 major projects delivered this quarter in key markets like Frankfurt, New York, and Singapore, and 31 more major projects underway across 23 markets in 16 countries. Our global interconnection franchise continues to thrive with over 414,000 total interconnections on our industry-leading platform. In Q3, we added an incremental 7,800 interconnections now have at least 1 major cloud on-ramping, 42 metros around the world, 2 times more than the nearest competitor. A clear indication that Equinix is the home of the interconnected cloud. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 6% quarter-over-quarter, and 30% year-over-year to over 21 terabits per second, as traffic growth remains robust. Equinix Fabric saw excellent growth continuing significantly over index within the broader interconnection portfolio. More than 2,800 customers are now on Fabric, attach rates moving up into the right as businesses diversify their end destinations and service providers integrate Fabric into their own solutions. In September, we extended Platform Equinix into our 27th country, with the close of our GPX acquisition, entering the strategic Indian market. Our 2 data centers in Mumbai form a network-dense campus with more than 350 international and local companies, including 6 on-ramps to the world's leading Cloud service providers and a robust network ecosystem. GPX represents an ideal entry point into this top 10 GDP country, and we expect to expand our operations significantly in India over the coming years as we tap into this rapidly growing market. In parallel with our tremendous retail success, we continue to expand our xScale business. In October, we announced plans to expand in Australia with an agreement to establish a $575 million in joint venture with PGIM real estate to develop two data centers in Sydney, which will provide more than 55 megawatts of capacity when fully built. Also, during the quarter, we closed the first phase of our previous slide-outs to [Indiscernible] joint venture with GIC and signed 2 megawatts with the hyperscalers in Frankfurt. We currently have 8 xScale built under development, including our newly announced [Indiscernible] 3, Mexico C3 and Sydney 9 assets, which will collectively added 25 megawatts capacity when they open in the first half of 2022. The total investment of our various hyper-scale joint ventures when closed and fully built-out, is now expected to be more than $7.5 billion across 34 facilities globally with more than 675 megawatts of power fast. Turning our [Indiscernible] recharge services, our Equinix 's metal business saw strong revenue growth at Cloud-native and service provider customers continue to embrace the ability to deploy physical infrastructure at software speed. And network-edge is our robust growth as established customers purchase more virtual network functions across additional metrics. By year-end, we expect network-edge to be available in 25 metros around the world. So let me cover highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical continues to be a foundation for the business. With strength in the quarter in cable and satellite sub-segments and continued momentum in joint go-to-market with our top net with partners across the globe. Expansions this quarter included Zayo Group, a global communications infrastructure Company adding interconnection and colocation capacity to support demand, Vocus, Australia's leading specialist fiber and network solutions provider, building infrastructure in both Sydney and Melbourne to offer network services, and Hurricane Electric, a global network service provider, utilizing Equinix Fabric to allow Enterprise customers to access their IP transit products at scale and in real-time. Our enterprise vertical saw another strong quarter led by manufacturing in FinTech and record channel activity. New wins and expansions included a Fortune 100 -named manufacturing Company, deploying global network hubs to enable their stats analytics offering, a leading technology manufacturer deploying a custom-liquid cooled environment and solution center to support the next-generation of high performance compute, and a Fortune 250 online retailer and e-commerce platform, deploying across Platform Equinix with low latency, cloud-adjacent network hubs to support their retail branded sites. Our cloud and IT verticals saw particular strength in the Americas, as industry-specific cloud solutions continue to be a catalyst for innovation and new growth. Expansion this quarter included Adobe, a leading cloud software provider, deploying infrastructures towards platforms and optimize sustainable participation in key digital markets and ecosystems. Wasabi, a U.S. based object storage Company expanding their offering on Equinix Fabric into APAC and EMEA, enabling customers to easily connect their bare metal workflows posted on Equinix Metal, and a top 5 global software provider deploying core metals to support their growing user base in demand in both Mexico City and Sao Paulo. Content and digital media had a great bookings quarter with resurgence in this vertical being led by APAC and broad-based strength in the gaming and streaming sub-segments as consumer demand for at-home digital services remains strong. Expansion this quarter included Netflix, a global streaming services spanning across Platform Equinix to new and existing markets to support OTT delivery, Kingsoft, a Chinese cloud provider expanding into sand port to support rapid sales growth, and a top 3 content distributor extending coverage and scale for its growing platform in the delivery of new and existing security solutions. And our channel program continues to shine, delivering another robust quarter. This important go-to-market notion accounted for over 35% of total bookings, nearly half of our enterprise bookings in more than 60% of our new logos in the quarter. We are benefiting from tremendous momentum in hybrid cloud adoption and seeing particular strength from joint enterprise pursuits with our key alliance partners such as AT&T, AWS, Dell, HPE, and Microsoft. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and included a marquee win with NVIDIA, IBM, and SBA for Continental Group, a worldwide automotive parts supplier billion - interconnected global network to optimize workloads and speed up AI training for their advanced driver assistance systems. So now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter.\nKeith Taylor: Great. Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to all. Well, let me start by saying the Equinix business continues to hum, and once again, we met our expectations are better. We had a very solid quarter. The macro-environment for digital infrastructure continues to drive expanding market opportunities, as demonstrated by another outstanding bookings quarter, both at the gross and the net level from our industry leading go-to-market engine. Our bookings backlog remains both significant and elevated as we work to install the substantial volume of business close through the past few quarters. And our forward-looking pipeline is extremely healthy in all our regions. Our channel sales activity was the best in our history and our global platform delivered healthy, inter and inter-region activity. We have firm MRR per cabinet yields with yet again, net positive pricing actions, a validation of our differentiated operating model compared to others in our space. On a year-to-date basis, our global design and construction and OPS teams have delivered more than 18,000 cabinets of retail capacity, and 40 megawatts of xScale inventory while also rolling out critical network infrastructure assets across our targeted markets with support of our Fabric, network edge, and metal service offerings. We've seen no major delays today with delivering new capacity despite general market concerns related to supply chain challenges. A reflection of the efforts put forth by our best-in-class procurement as strategic sourcing teams. Now, let me cover the results for the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalizing constant currency basis. As depicted on the Slide 4, global Q3 revenues were $1.675 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year due to strong business performance across our platform led by the Americas region. Non-recurring revenue represented about 7% of revenues due to an increase in custom installation work and EMEA xScale joint venture fees. For Q4, we expect MRR to trend downward, decreasing sequentially by approximately $12 million due to lower xScale fees and the timing of large customer installations. Q3 revenues, net of our FX hedges included a $6 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Total Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $786 million or 47% of revenues at the high end of our guidance expectations due to timing of spend and low integration costs. Q3 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges included a $3 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates at $3 million of integration costs. Total Q3 AFFO was $628 million, the result of strong operating performance, consistent with our expectations. Similar to prior years, we expect seasonally higher levels of recurring capex in Q4 as our operating teams work to complete the 2021 projects. Total Q3 MRR term was 2.1%. We continue to expect MRR turn for the full year to be at a lower end of our targeted quarterly range, up 2 to 2.5%. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC region's revenue grew 11% year-over-year, followed by the Americas at 7% and EMEA at 6%. As previously discussed, we expect the EMEA growth rate to return to normalized levels in Q4 as we lap interconnection price increases, and the other one-off positive adjustments from last year. The Americas region saw continued strength with our third consecutive quarter of record bookings with a broad distribution across metros, including some of our smaller markets such as Boston, Denver, Mexico City, Seattle, and Toronto. The America sales teams continue to sell the global platform within notable increase in activity coming from our Canadian team, a benefit derived from the transaction with Bell Canada, which is outperforming our expectations. Our EMEA region had a solid quarter with strength coming from our Amsterdam, Frankfurt, and Madrid markets as enterprise customers and the channel drive bookings. And as we aim to meet high sustainability and efficiency standards while progressing towards our 2030 science-based targets, new builds like our recently opened Frankfurt IBX service a model to blended of positively contributing to the local microclimate. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a solid quarter with momentum across all of our metros led by Singapore. New deal activity focused on small to medium-sized deployments with firm pricing and continued strength in our cross-border zone. Our Hong Kong markets saw a nice rebound in bookings performance, although continues to feel constrained given the market uncertainty. And now looking our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. We ended the quarter with cash of about $1.4 billion and our net debt leverage ratio remains low, particularly relative to our industry peers. Our balance sheet remains highly flexible in liquid and we have our low AFFO cash payout ratio. With regards to our outstanding debt, we have minimal near-term exposure to potentially rising interest rates with 95% of our debt fixed at a weighted average maturity of over 9 years. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $678 million, including recurring CapEx of $48 million. We opened 11 new projects this quarter, including new [Indiscernible] in Frankfurt, Osaka and Singapore, and purchased land for development in Barcelona, Frankfurt and Helsinki. On the Zale side of the business, we opened our Sao Paulo 5 and Frankfurt 9 assets. We also closed the first phase of our media 2 joint venture with GIC for net cash proceeds after 20% equity contribution of approximately $140 million, including 30 more $4 million coming from the contribution of our Sao Paulo 5 asset into the joint venture after quarter ends. On a separate note, we continue to actively manage our practices, suppliers and have built up an appropriate inventory of parts and components, as we hedge against supply chain challenges in support of our business needs. Finally, total recurring revenues for more asset stepped up 59% due to the acquisition of our Sydney 1 and Sydney 2 IBXes. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our 153 stabilized assets increased recurring revenue by 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 86% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. We expect to exit the year closer to the top end of our stabilized asset growth range, and part due to strong Americas revenue growth. And please refer to Slides 11 to 50 for our updated summary of 2021 guidance and bridges. Do note, our guidance now includes the anticipated results from the GPX India acquisition, which closed in September. For the full-year 2021, we expect revenues to grow approximately 8% on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our updated revenue guidance implies our largest ever quarterly step-up in recurring revenues on a normalized basis. A reflection of our continued strong execution. Revenues include about $5 million from the GPX acquisition and reflect updated FX rates. We expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA margins, before integration costs to be greater than 47% and now include about $3 million from GPX Acquisition and reflect updated FX rates. We expect to spend $80 million of integration costs in 2021. And we expect 2021 AFFO to grow 10% to 11% on a normalized and constant currency basis compared to the prior year and to deliver AFFO per share growth of 9% to 10%. Our AFFO guidance includes some AFFO impacting accelerated spend, including recurring CapEx, an elevated cash commissions associated with our strong bookings performance. 2021 CapEx is expected to range between $2.7 billion and $3 billion including about $450 million of on-balance sheet xScale CapEx, a significant portion of which has been or will be reimbursed by the JVs, and $193 million of recurring CapEx spend at the midpoint. So let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thanks, Keith. Our business continues to perform exceptionally well delivering strong and consistent results throughout the changing times. The pandemic has been a driving force for digital transformation and as businesses seek to respond to this imperative, the infrastructure underpinning these services must keep pace. We continue to prosecute multiple compelling growth factors, expanding our platform geographically, scaling our go-to-market engine to capture new customers, and bringing new services to bear that will expand our addressable market. We're evolving the way we design, create, and deliver our products and services to fuel our growth and meet the changing needs of our customers. To that end, I'd also like to welcome Ron Guerrier to our Board of Directors. As a veteran CIO to Fortune 500 corporations and government, Ron brings a unique perspective to the Equinix board as we continue to innovate our digital infrastructure offerings for the digital leaders of today and tomorrow. I'd like to close by expressing my gratitude to our more than 10,000 employees, whose commitment to keep our customers at the center of everything we do continues to drive our market leadership. They embody our commitment to show up every day with an in-service to mindset, starting by being in service to each other, which in turn allows us to be in service to our customers, to our communities, and to you, our shareholders. So let me stop there and open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We would now like to open the phone lines for question. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ari Klein from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAri Klein: Thanks. It sounds like new customer net adds have been up a fair bit this year and the channel partnerships are doing really well. Can you provide some additional color on what you're seeing there, maybe where you're seeing the most traction from new customers, and also in the channel from a regional standpoint.\nCharles Meyers: Sure, yes, I mean,-- I think we're seeing strength across the board, but really the enterprise side of the business, I think is where a lot of the new customer ads are coming from. And most of those, about 60% are coming through channel, as we talked about in the script. So we're seeing a big uptick that said more than 35% percent of the bookings coming through the channel. And I think it's been really encouraging, We're really seeing strength with our top channel partners and really our top alliance partners in particular, who are really engaged in joint enterprise pursuit with us. In terms of pursuing hybrid multi-cloud opportunities and people implementing hybrid architectures. And so -- in fact, I'll give you a start. We had our top 4 alliance partners in this quarter accounted for 10% of the total bookings. And that's not 10% of the channel book, is that 10% of the total bookings. So really strong momentum with the channel partners and it's across a number of verticals and it's across a number of use cases, but real strength in terms of how people are thinking about using corporate data to draw insights, how they, therefore, want to store that data centrally, act on it from a variety of cloud resources, and then, also AI as a key driver. In fact, we had a big win -- big joint win with NVIDIA on that front as we talked about in the script, and so really great progress there, and I think the range of use cases is really strong. We had -- in fact we had an event today that we call Connects (ph) that was -- we had I think about 500 registrations for that event -- for enterprises talking about a variety of use cases implemented on Fabric and so we're seeing some really good momentum.\nAri Klein: Thanks. And then just on churn, it's tracking well below where it's been in historically. What's driving that and how sustainable do you think that is moving forward?\nCharles Meyers: Again, I do think that that's a durable trend. I would always comment that there's some potential lumpiness in churn at times. But I think if you look at the trend line on that, it's been the line of best fit is clearly downward there. And so we've had a good year. And as we said, we expect our full-year churn to be toward the bottom end of the range that we talked about, %2 to %2.5. And I think the big driver of that is really mix of business. We're getting the right time deployments, right kinds of customers, right kind of use cases. And I think that's a lot of credit to our sales and marketing team in terms of what they're doing from a targeting perspective, and to our commercial teams in terms of how we're really sort of focusing the business. I do think it's durable and I think that's going to be a -- continue to be a key driver in the business going forward.\nAri Klein: Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJordan Sadler: Thanks. Wanted touch base on some of the inflationary pressures that have been affecting folks. First, just maybe you could talk about the impact, if any, rising power costs may have had in the quarter on your full-year guide. And maybe elaborate if you could, your hedging protocol by region.\nCharles Meyers: Sure. I'll start and then Keith can jump in if he wants to add anything, but I'd say this, other than some small 1-time items on the power side that had a slight impact on our Q4 guide, we're seeing power cuts pretty much come in where we expected for the remainder of the year and into early next year, I think there's more going to be the longer-term volatility into 2022 that we're really looking at. But as you said, similar to currency we've got a pretty extensive hedging program that really feathers in our hedges over a multiyear period. And we're about 85% hedged in the unregulated markets which represent most of our largest markets. And so our contracts do allow for us to adjust pricing based on underlying costs. And we're actively working to implement adjustments where we think that's appropriate. But, again, you guys, I think recognize our businesses is different in they were more heavily circuit based on our power mix. So whereas it's a little more seamless and pass through those costs in immediate power environment, takes a little more finesse to do that in the circa base power environment. But I would say that we act -- as I've said, we're actively working that in terms of how to do it. And I'd say that our experience in Europe with the cross-connect pricing increases over the last couple of years, really give us some confidence that we'll be able to go get that done effectively. So no doubt there's more volatility in the energy markets. So we're watching those closely, and we're going to continue to adapt our strategies accordingly.\nJordan Sadler: And just I guess as a follow-up, just one, what would the presenting the portfolio is sort of circuit billing oriented. And then when you factor in some of the ability to pass some of this through, what's sort of the benefit that you may be layered in there in terms of top-line?\nCharles Meyers: About 80% of the -- about 80% of the portfolio is circuit based. And again, that's been a key to our -- that's part of our overall return story. We've been very effective in terms of driving sort of aggregate returns across space and power because of that circuit based power component of the business, and so in terms of its really more a matter of how effective can we be in terms of passing through price increases, underlying costs increase increases in the form of price to the circuit based power environment. So again, we have the contractual ability to do that, and it's just a matter of whether we -- I do think it won't be like circuit power we're going to where we are going to get every bit of that path. So but I think that we'll look at that market-by-market and assess what the rate approaches.\nJordan Sadler: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jon Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJon Atkin: Thanks. I was interested in xScale, and if you can maybe highlight any major differences with PGI and compared to GIC. And then more broadly as we sort of think about 2022 growth drivers for revenue -- revenue's margins CapEx, as well as AFFO, perhaps coming from xScale. But anything to keep in mind -- I know you're not going to give guidance on this call, but from a qualitative perspective, tailwinds and headwinds to keep in mind for next year. Thanks.\nKeith Taylor: Why don't I take the first one? And then, I think, Charles might take the second one. As it relates to -- the deal structuring between PGIM and GIC is very similar. In many ways the construct was developed off of contracting structure with the GIC while we work ed with PGIM. Again, delighted to have another partner in a different market in support of our Australian business. As it relates to our ability -- to the performance this quarter, again, as you've heard from some of our prior calls we basically sold out most of the capacity that we've delivered to market. And so we're very eager to continue our builds. We have eight builds currently underway in xScale, and the team is working very hard to identify customer appropriate customers for that capacity plus more. So I'll just leave you with is an exciting time for us in the xScale space. We're putting the money, the work, and as Charles alluded to in his prepared remarks and was $7.5 billion of capital is going to be deployed across 34 assets. And it's -- we still have more to talk about. So why don't I leave it there and just recognize that xScale in of itself right now is not a big component of our revenues or AFFO. But it does create some lumpiness that you've seen in the non-recurring line, which we highlighted in our prepared remarks Q4, we just don't expect as much of that non-recurring revenue as we've seen before. But certainly as we look into '22 and beyond, those start to see that step-up again from a non-recurring perspective. Then you also see more of the recurring piece come into play for xScale.\nCharles Meyers: Jon, on the other ones, I say want. Look, I haven't been -- I'm an optimist because I have never been, I guess on the business, how it's performing, what the magnitude of the opportunity ahead is. A little bit of noise in the quarter here, but I think that we had a -- we continue -- the business continues to perform. The fundamentals are very strong. 8,000 [Indiscernible] been added to add in the quarter, 3,000 billable cab ads, record bookings really for the past 3 quarters, at least seasonally adjusted in terms of this is our best Q3 ever. This quarter great degree predictability turn, as I said, at the low-end firm pricing, we added another quarter of positive pricing adjustments that Keith talked about in the script and continue to see good momentum on our new markets. And if you look at big markets that we're relatively earlier entering in in terms of -- think places like Mexico and now India. Huge opportunities in front of us there to over-indexing growth in those markets. And then digital services is really -- Our customers are responding really well to those products even though they're at an earlier stage growth. So I think as I look into 2022 in terms of headwinds, tailwinds, etc, feel really good about the bookings momentum, feel really good about the pricing in our relevance to customers and therefore our ability to support firm price points. A churn looks good, good deal mix is going to continue to be absolutely key to maintaining that. As I said, I think the headwinds more on making sure that we continue to -- we talked a little bit about power as a potential headwind there in some areas. We talked about, I think continuing to drive operational efficiencies in the business is going to be a key focus for us to drive operating leverage. And then continuing to work backlog. I think we've got a big backlog partially because we've got some big deals that have gone into that. We got to continue to work through that backlog, certain deal types, tab slightly longer book-to-bill. And I think we're seeing that as part of the complexity of implementing these more multi-vendor, hybrid multi-cloud kind of deals. And so we're continuing to sort of hone our capabilities there. So if we can continue to drive those things, I think we will be able to really take advantage of the bookings momentum that's there. And obviously, we'll give you a color on all of that as we go into the 2022 guide.\nJon Atkin: And then if I could throw 1 in on M&A, whether it's networking-related or software consolidation within the bare metal space, but anything kind of non-core to the classic data center business from an M&A tuck-in perspective, what --to what degree do you regularly look at those sorts of opportunities? And is there anything that you feel would sort of augment the platform from that perspective?\nCharles Meyers: Yeah. A great question, Jon. I would say that we're continuing to learn in that area and we're accelerating our kind of investment of energy in the -- understanding that landscape. And at the same time we are -- we're still digesting and learning some of the business around digital services and how to adapt our approach and build capabilities both from -- evolved capabilities, both from a design and development perspective, as well as from a deployment and go-to-market perspective. And so we're continuing to honor our -- cut our teeth there and really learn those things in that market. But I do think there are real opportunities there. And so we'll be continue to be active in that area in terms of looking at potential opportunities, both to add talent and technology and capabilities, and really learning that landscape better over the course of this year and next year and beyond.\nJon Atkin: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan, please go ahead.\nRichard Choe: Hi, this is Richard for Phil. Just wanted to ask about the strength in the America. It went from kind of a modest growth to now it seems like a very strong growth environment. What are you seeing there, and how long can the bookings continue?\nCharles Meyers: Hey, Richard, but I hope that party continues for a while. I would tell you I think we feel pretty good about that business. Again, we certainly have -- we spend more quarters than I would like talking about when the Verizon term was going to abate. And so I'm loving talking about the other side of that now. We're really the scale of that business, tremendous sales execution in the region, both for bookings into the region as well as global bookings to the platform elsewhere. I would say we feel really good about the performance of the America's region right now and expect that growth rate is going to continue to persist at elevated levels. And then so we feel good about that fact. I think driving attach rates now to continue to increase the share of wallet with our very, very large customer base and bringing them some of our new services is some of the new area of focus and really leveraging our channel partners to do that. So anything to add Keith\nKeith Taylor: The other thing I would just say, Charles and Richard, remember this region's 75% utilized, so we have substantial amount of capacity that we have built and we continue to build in core markets. And the other thing I'd just -- as Charles alluded to, normally the focus that we have on the right customers, that our sales leadership team in the Americas and beyond are doing such a great job of selling the platform. And so the opportunity that we said -- that we talked about inter-region and intra -region is very real. So overall very optimistic about what we're seeing in the Americas region.\nRichard Choe: And a quick follow-up turning, you see an issue in the Americas, are you seeing that lower now or has that not changed as much.\nCharles Meyers: Well, I mean, I think it was -- I guess you'd have to obviously, you've been in the story for a long time, Richard has been, but I think there was a period of time when we had elevated churn associated with really honing our customer mix and our core competitive advantages and making sure that we were focused on those that would say that was back in the early days I was here in the 2011-12 time frame, when we really set about honing our sales process and driving greater deal commercial scrutiny, etc. And I think that -- so we had a little bit of elevated turn as we work through that process. And then we had a little bit during the period of time when we digested some of the Verizon assets. We talked about the fact that we're a few -- several quarters ago, where we had deals that candidly just we're outside of the traditional sweet spot that we would be focused on. And I think it's the right long-term value creating decision for us to let those kind of things go and use that space and net capacity for advancing the strategy that we're really focused on. And so now, you're seeing that, and as I've always said, the most -- the best -- the best way to avoid losing a deal is to get the right deal in the door to begin with, and so that's what our focus is. I think our sales teams are really doing an exceptional job on that. Our new sales leader [Indiscernible] in the U.S. is just a dynamite sales leader doing an incredible job, and he's got a great leadership team across the board there. And so I got to give some credit [Indiscernible] to our [Indiscernible] in America. It's just a great team really driving that thing.\nRichard Choe: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Guarino from Green Street. Please go ahead.\nDavid Guarino: Thanks. Hey, Charles. Can you elaborate on your comments about pricing being firm? What exactly does firm mean and maybe specifically, if that's renewals or new leases? And then also, maybe just helpful would be if you could put some data behind it on the MRR per cabinet in the U.S. Could you tell us what that was, excluding the large footprint deployments this quarter?\nCharles Meyers: Sure. I mean, when we say firm pricing, one of the big things we've talked about it is when we had net positive pricing actions in the quarter. So we essentially take what we're getting in terms of uplifts on our pricing accelerators if you will increase -- price increases that are contractually built in. We offset that against any potential downward movement that might occur on a release. Our business tends to move it a little bit of a saucy within that. It's -- we'll see these price escalators over kind of 3 to 5-year contract. We'll get a renewal that might have some summary rates. And then, we will kind of go through that cycle again. But in any given quarter, we're seeing those positive pricing -- overall positive pricing adjustments. And that's just, I think, a reflection of our ability to sustain those higher price points. As you can see in the Americas, actually in all of the world, we've been sort of moving MRR per cab up into the right for a long period of time. We've seen some really strong moving in EMEA over the last couple of years because of the interconnection price increasing. I think we were slightly down in the U.S. on a constant currency basis, but that often and depend on the timing of installs and those kind of things, and so -- I mean, 23.93 per cab is just an exceptional number. And so I think if you look at that relative to the rest of the industry, I think you would find it to be sort of far, far away, but the best kind of yield in the industry itself. And so in terms of normalizing that for large footprint, we really aren't doing any really large footprint in the U.S. We occasionally will do an anchor deal in a facility, but we're not really active in the hyperscale or xScale space in the U.S. And we've talked about why that is in the past. And if you look at -- even in the other markets, we're doing that now almost strictly through the xScale business and through the joint venture. And so, that's not rolling in to the results that you see here, that really only rolls into our core financials in the form of fees and other things that we think are quite creative to the overall financial picture. So that's kind of picture on pricing. Pricing, I think on xScale continues to be competitive certainly, which is why returns in that business are a little lower but that's also why we decided to go do this through joint ventures where 80% of that capital is through a financial partner.\nDavid Guarino: Okay. And then maybe just one clarification too on the stabilized revenue growth at the low-end factory of 5% range and I know Keith said it's going to step up again next quarter, but would the drag this quarter just due to a timing of commencement on leases?\nKeith Taylor: Could you repeat that? Is a drag, the timing of what?\nDavid Guarino: Of commencements on leases was it just certain leases got push into next quarter? I guess if we're going to get to the high-end of the guidance rates. I would assume you have a pretty big step-up in near revenue growth. So I was wondering if there was something driving it or just a lease has got pushed into Q4 in terms of when you will start realizing revenue?\nKeith Taylor: Well, first and foremost, as Charles alluded to in the end, we will -- just an outstanding quarter again from a bookings perspective. And more particularly in the Americas region. And as we just sort of talked about, the Americas enjoy the highest pricing environment. So there's a number of things that are going on. Part of it is sure timing, but it is also the conversion of our backlog into a billable cabinet that will make a big difference here. And so, there's nothing that I would say overly extraordinary other than we're just seeing overall momentum of the business continues to scale. Churn starting as abated or is abating, and then you've got a good price point with your inventory. This way we could be booked, sorry, netbook. Go from backlog into a billing item.\nDavid Guarino: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Great, good evening. thanks a lot. just coming back to the inflation and supply chain commentary. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the construction and the development side of things, availability of labor, raw materials? What's going on in the various markets around the world at both in terms of costs and your ability to pass that along as well as any impacts on timelines for development, and then you've been very active on the xScale, but in terms of other M&A, how are you thinking about the landscape out there or is this going to be more focused on sort of small tuck-ins from here, Thank you.\nCharles Meyers: Sure. So I'd start by saying that generally, I think our team has done a just an exceptional job navigating the current realities as it relates to supply chain around the world that our bottom-line message has been and continues to be that we really aren't seeing any meaningful negative impacts to our business. But that doesn't just magically happen. It happens by our team doing really great work to go and make sure that we are mitigating the risks that are out there. The way I -- Chuck, we talked about it internally is really 4 kind of levels to the supply chain potential risks. The first one is really facility level or in other words, are there -- are those constraints out there impacting our ability to deliver projects on time and on budget? And while we've seen some modest level of delays on a few projects, those are typically actually more associated with COVID delays and they are supply-chain candidly. As Keith noted in his script, we've actually taken on some inventory or contractual forward commits to the tune of about a $100 million, that is giving us the confidence to be able to make sure that we can deliver our projects on time. That combined with the fact that we've got a huge number of projects underway. And they are all over the world and we can move separate around. Typically, it's fundable between sort of projects. And so the team, the construction team, the procurement team, the sourcing team have just done a phenomenal job in terms of mitigating that, in terms of IBX availability and the delivery timelines. The next level on -- is really at the services level. In other words, our underlying services check there. Our network-related services like Fabric, Connect, etc. and Metal are we -- do we have the capacity to support the forecast there? And what we've done there is we've just forward purchased several quarters of capacity to give us the confidence that we can support that. And so feeling good about that as well. The third level is really deployment level. In other words, cage materials and other things that are needed as people build out their cages. We've also stockpiled there. Occasionally, there are circumstances where people have non-standard items that caused delays. But if they're sticking within the middle of the bell curve in terms of what their needs are, we're not seeing delays there. And then customer level delays is sort of the last level, which is our customers delayed in terms of getting their IT equipment to loan into deployments. And if not, are they delaying or asking for delays for commencement and those kind of things? And again, while we've seen a few of those things, they just -- in the grand seal -- scope of things and in the scale of our business are just not particularly meaningful. So there's some, there's probably a little bit of pressure on costs in some areas. We've been able to take advantage of our scale and I think to mitigate that, we're continuing to -- people often asked the question as to whether cost to build as inflationary or not, I would tell you that I think we've been able to keep up with it from a design standpoint and continuing to optimize our designs faster than costs are going up, so we're trying to keep ahead of the game there, but I think our team has done a really terrific job of managing those things. And I do think that we're -- we expect that things will start to stabilize over the course of 2022 from a supply chain perspective. So long answer there, but hopefully that gives you some perspective.\nSimon Flannery: Great color. And the M&A?\nCharles Meyers: I'm sorry, from an M&A perspective, I would say we are -- we continue to think there's opportunity out there, I mean, we talked -- I think John asked question about M&A in the -- in sort of the digital services side on the business. But there's also, we think continued opportunity in terms of extending our reach and looking for critical assets in the market that might be accretive to our strategy. And so, and we've got the balance sheet, the firepower to go after those kinds of things. And so we will continue to be active as appropriate. They're always with a high degree of certainty on getting the right deals.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. Curious for 2 questions. The first one is when you look at what's happening on the network side for network customers, are you seeing an increasing amount of telecom and wireless companies place their core network infrastructure in your facilities, rather than having their own mobile switching offices that it might have had it in the more legacy years of the telecom landscape? And what kind of opportunity that is for you as you -- if you look at wireless and 5G trying to take more services to the edge? And then, the second question is, what do you make of the tower companies investing in datacenter assets? And do you believe that your datacenter business, as well as power portfolios are destined to be partners, or maybe someday fall under the same ownership structure as you look out into the future.\nCharles Meyers: Great questions by for sure, I would say on the network side, I'd say it's a mixed bag. I think that there is a movement towards people viewing third-party facilities, particularly facilities like Equinix, where there's large degrees of aggregation as logical places to put portions of their core infrastructure. That said, I think these companies are also have a long history of building on in their own facilities and I think that is -- and there are still a lot of forces within those companies that want that to continue. And so I think we've been very active on the business development front and we have seen some success there. And in terms of how they think about putting certain portions of their core 5G infrastructure, for example, into our facilities. And we have the Dallas approved concept center there that we've been actively working with both equipment providers as well as service providers on sort of proving out some of those potential value propositions. So I think we're still -- that will happen over a lot of long core stem. I do think we're more successful with people who are coming into those markets as disruptors because they think differently about it. And so -- and I do think there are some pretty interesting opportunities there. And we're working with a few -- I wanted -- I want to say the names right now, but I'm not sure that they are public, yeah that I can't, so I won't. But there are some interesting things going on there. As to the tower side, we've been -- we believe there is some synergy between sort of companies that have broad-based real estate assets that are proximate to communications infrastructure, which is sort of the definition of tower companies, and I can see why and understand why they may have an interest in data center assets and how they fit in potentially to their portfolio. But I would tell you that for the most part, we see a strong demand for traffic at the edge there too. A very significant majority of that traffic could go back to the aggregated edge. And that's really our sweet spot. That's where our differentiation is. Definitely there are use cases that were mobile edge compute, out further. Things like shop for automation and those kind of things. I think they are real use cases that 5G is going to be able to accelerate and we're certainly keeping our eyes on that and the active there from a business development standpoint. But I do think that -- I think it's more likely that we would partner in some way with those folks over time. It's not necessarily obvious to me that those have to live under the same ownership structure. But I think we will just have to continue to see how the markets play out. Keith, I don't know if you have a different view on that?\nKeith Taylor: [Indiscernible] Well said.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erik Rasmussen from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nErik Rasmussen: Thanks for the questions. So getting back to xScale, you've obviously made a lot of progress in Europe and APAC thus far. And recently announcing another JV partner in Australia. But I guess circling back at what point the Americas become more interesting. As you look to expand the xScale, are you seeing any characteristics that are starting to get more exciting about this market than what you're seeing elsewhere or recent in the same scenario?\nCharles Meyers: Well, I think that when people start cutting each others throats on pricing. It will be real hard. It's not -- I mean, it's still a very competitive market, I think. And so I think that's different in terms of if you look at the broad Americas because I think there is opportunities in last and for us. Obviously, we already announced projects in Brazil I think we bring certain different, some very distinctive advantages there. I do think there is a ton of demand and as we've always said, we're not, we're not going to say we're religiously out of the business of doing that, but I think it would have to be under a special set of circumstances in terms of why we think that fits with the strategy. Because we're -- a strategy as you'll recall, is that we wanted to use those as opportunities to further our position in the cloud ecosystem, continue to invest in the relationship with the major cloud service providers, and broader set of hyperscalers and use that to create this advantage overall position in cloud ecosystem. We feel very good about our position, particularly in the U.S., and whether or not the xScale would be particularly accretive to that, I think is an open question. But we're not -- we're definitely not -- it's not out of the question that we would do that. I just think it's -- I think right now there are a lot of opportunities for us in other markets that we think are more attractive.\nErik Rasmussen: Okay. and maybe just my follow-up, the Americas was strong once again, this quarter, would you characterize that most of the strength is coming maybe from Bell Canada or is it other factors that you can comment on as it relates to the strength in that region.\nKeith Taylor: Well, there was a reference in the prepared remarks just to talk about Canadian business is better than our -- it's doing better than we originally anticipating. Good on the team, and they're also selling global platform out of Canada into our other assets around the world. As it specifically relates to the Americas business, I think it's very good back to some of the fundamentals that Charles alluded to. We're targeting the right customers with the right applications and putting in the right places. And at the same, by the same token, we've got an inventory set that they really caters to a diverse set of customers across, across the U.S. or the Americas as a whole. And so between the assets we serve, the customers we target, and the delivery of services that are additive to co-location interconnection, I just think we're in a much better space. Our position and as a result, we are going to win more than our fair share of the businesses out there.\nErik Rasmussen: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Colby Synesael from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nColby Synesael: Charles, in response to Jon Atkin 's question regarding your outlook on 2022, my take from your response was the top-line next sign that you're concerned is around margins, whether it's operational efficiencies or in particular power costs. And as it relates to the question around power costs, I feel you may have created more questions than answers so far in this call. And I'd love to get a little bit more detail. Specifically, you guys, I think had talked about your Analyst Day in June, seeing margins go up just modestly in 2022. I'm curious if you still think that that's possible. Secondly, you mentioned that you hedge an unregulated markets around 85%. How far out are those hedges? Does it seems like you're suggesting that you're okay with power costs going into 2022, but not necessarily for the full year. And then as it relates to the potential impact of power, do you think at the end of the day this could be up 25 basis point impact, 50 basis point impact, hundreds of basis point impact, just anything that gives us a better sense because my concern personally, is that we could now be in a situation where margins go down in 2022. And then just lastly, as it relates to AFFO, it looks like AFFO guidance implies a pretty meaningful step-down in the fourth quarter. Is that just the maintenance CapEx components that you talked about, Keith? Or is there something else there? And what's the better jump off point as we look to go to in 2022? Is it the third quarter? Or is it the fourth-quarter? Thank you.\nCharles Meyers: Good questions Colby. We will be able to give you all the answers there, but I would say and obviously we're not going to kind of give you a 2022 guys. But I would say that you're -- generally I would say we continue to feel good about the momentum in the business from a bookings and demand perspective, I think that we did talk about driving efficiencies and I think the pursuit of the 50% margin target is something we continue to be focused on and that's an area where we continue to have worked -- knew exactly at what pace we can do that, and what that implies for the 2022 margin. I don't know. And I do think it will require us to dig in deeper on power. And I don't think we're yet in a position where we can quantify any of that for you other than -- in terms of the hedging that we -- I mean, they are multiyear hedges, but they're feathered in. And so obviously do become less impactful as you look further out. And so I do think that there's more risk as you go out, but I think the good part of that is that it gives us time to determine what our approach is going to be to passing those costs through and assessing how to do that and to what degree. That is how much of a recovery we can see there, and we don't know the answers to all those things, and so I think we're going to track those, we're going to look at the markets where there's volatility. And I think that's something where unfortunately I think we'll just have to come back to you when we look into -- as we look into 2022 guide, and give you more perspective about that.\nKeith Taylor: And so Colby I just wanted to go back to again a couple of other questions. So there's 2 things that I felt I heard you ask.1. is what's happening quarter-over-quarter. What's going on in Q4? And there was a reference that we made and that we accelerated some costs into this year, so that's number one both from our recurring CapEx perspective and some operating spend. And we did that for a number of reasons, and part of it is supply chain specific. The other part is we alluded to in the prepared remarks. When you look at AFFO in and of itself, Q4 is historically one of our lower performing AFFO quarters. That's why we don't guide on a quarterly basis, we gave you the annual number and say, this is what we will do, and we recognize things will move around, but the reality is Q4 always tends to be a higher recurring CapEx quarter, and that's what you're seeing in the guide that we've delivered at a $193 million at midpoint. So it gives you a real sense. It's a big step-up in our recurring CapEx for Q4. The other thing is, as we have said, that we have had a lot of success in the business and as a result, the cash payout attributed to commissions that is more substantial than we originally anticipated in Q4, and that's reflected in the guidance. And that's AFFO impacting on EBITDA impacting it, so there's a lot of nuances. But overall, when you look at the fundamental business, it's performed better than we anticipated. For every single quarter of the year, we're delivering against the expectations we have set. And as you -- I think, you know well that we based our guide both on revenue EBITDA and AFFO throughout the year. And we're at a point now where we feel comfortable and now we're focusing on 2022. And that's where the energy of the business is again focused on.\nColby Synesael: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Frank Loutsan from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nFrank Louthan: About the [Indiscernible]America has been a tougher market last year. What sort of changed there, and how long do you think you can continue to see some better results out of those markets? Thanks.\nCharles Meyers: Hey, Frank. Yes, as I said earlier, I think that business has a strong trajectory. I think we expect that to continue, we don't see this as a temporary improvement. I think we're as a business, moving in a very solid direction. Strong demand from customers, good sales execution, and again we don't expect that -- and again, churn mitigating, getting the right customers right deals. I think that will continue to drive strong performance from that region. Which, obviously, is a pretty major driver of our overall performance.\nFrank Louthan: Given, it can -- we expect this to be a little bit of a new baseline and kind of continue to grow from here, or how should we think about the current trend.\nCharles Meyers: Yeah, I think as to whether it really accelerates, I think we have to continue to look at our success in driving new services revenues and what the rate of new customer capture and attaches and those kind of things. But again, I think we feel really good about where the business is right now and feel like that's a sustainable growth rate for us.\nFrank Louthan: Right. Great. Thank you very much.\nKatrina Rymill: That concludes our Q3 call. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you all for participating in today's conference.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Keith Taylor",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to all. Well, let me start by saying the Equinix business continues to hum, and once again, we met our expectations are better. We had a very solid quarter. The macro-environment for digital infrastructure continues to drive expanding market opportunities, as demonstrated by another outstanding bookings quarter, both at the gross and the net level from our industry leading go-to-market engine. Our bookings backlog remains both significant and elevated as we work to install the substantial volume of business close through the past few quarters. And our forward-looking pipeline is extremely healthy in all our regions. Our channel sales activity was the best in our history and our global platform delivered healthy, inter and inter-region activity. We have firm MRR per cabinet yields with yet again, net positive pricing actions, a validation of our differentiated operating model compared to others in our space. On a year-to-date basis, our global design and construction and OPS teams have delivered more than 18,000 cabinets of retail capacity, and 40 megawatts of xScale inventory while also rolling out critical network infrastructure assets across our targeted markets with support of our Fabric, network edge, and metal service offerings. We've seen no major delays today with delivering new capacity despite general market concerns related to supply chain challenges. A reflection of the efforts put forth by our best-in-class procurement as strategic sourcing teams. Now, let me cover the results for the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalizing constant currency basis. As depicted on the Slide 4, global Q3 revenues were $1.675 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year due to strong business performance across our platform led by the Americas region. Non-recurring revenue represented about 7% of revenues due to an increase in custom installation work and EMEA xScale joint venture fees. For Q4, we expect MRR to trend downward, decreasing sequentially by approximately $12 million due to lower xScale fees and the timing of large customer installations. Q3 revenues, net of our FX hedges included a $6 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Total Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $786 million or 47% of revenues at the high end of our guidance expectations due to timing of spend and low integration costs. Q3 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges included a $3 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates at $3 million of integration costs. Total Q3 AFFO was $628 million, the result of strong operating performance, consistent with our expectations. Similar to prior years, we expect seasonally higher levels of recurring capex in Q4 as our operating teams work to complete the 2021 projects. Total Q3 MRR term was 2.1%. We continue to expect MRR turn for the full year to be at a lower end of our targeted quarterly range, up 2 to 2.5%. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC region's revenue grew 11% year-over-year, followed by the Americas at 7% and EMEA at 6%. As previously discussed, we expect the EMEA growth rate to return to normalized levels in Q4 as we lap interconnection price increases, and the other one-off positive adjustments from last year. The Americas region saw continued strength with our third consecutive quarter of record bookings with a broad distribution across metros, including some of our smaller markets such as Boston, Denver, Mexico City, Seattle, and Toronto. The America sales teams continue to sell the global platform within notable increase in activity coming from our Canadian team, a benefit derived from the transaction with Bell Canada, which is outperforming our expectations. Our EMEA region had a solid quarter with strength coming from our Amsterdam, Frankfurt, and Madrid markets as enterprise customers and the channel drive bookings. And as we aim to meet high sustainability and efficiency standards while progressing towards our 2030 science-based targets, new builds like our recently opened Frankfurt IBX service a model to blended of positively contributing to the local microclimate. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a solid quarter with momentum across all of our metros led by Singapore. New deal activity focused on small to medium-sized deployments with firm pricing and continued strength in our cross-border zone. Our Hong Kong markets saw a nice rebound in bookings performance, although continues to feel constrained given the market uncertainty. And now looking our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. We ended the quarter with cash of about $1.4 billion and our net debt leverage ratio remains low, particularly relative to our industry peers. Our balance sheet remains highly flexible in liquid and we have our low AFFO cash payout ratio. With regards to our outstanding debt, we have minimal near-term exposure to potentially rising interest rates with 95% of our debt fixed at a weighted average maturity of over 9 years. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $678 million, including recurring CapEx of $48 million. We opened 11 new projects this quarter, including new [Indiscernible] in Frankfurt, Osaka and Singapore, and purchased land for development in Barcelona, Frankfurt and Helsinki. On the Zale side of the business, we opened our Sao Paulo 5 and Frankfurt 9 assets. We also closed the first phase of our media 2 joint venture with GIC for net cash proceeds after 20% equity contribution of approximately $140 million, including 30 more $4 million coming from the contribution of our Sao Paulo 5 asset into the joint venture after quarter ends. On a separate note, we continue to actively manage our practices, suppliers and have built up an appropriate inventory of parts and components, as we hedge against supply chain challenges in support of our business needs. Finally, total recurring revenues for more asset stepped up 59% due to the acquisition of our Sydney 1 and Sydney 2 IBXes. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our 153 stabilized assets increased recurring revenue by 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 86% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. We expect to exit the year closer to the top end of our stabilized asset growth range, and part due to strong Americas revenue growth. And please refer to Slides 11 to 50 for our updated summary of 2021 guidance and bridges. Do note, our guidance now includes the anticipated results from the GPX India acquisition, which closed in September. For the full-year 2021, we expect revenues to grow approximately 8% on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our updated revenue guidance implies our largest ever quarterly step-up in recurring revenues on a normalized basis. A reflection of our continued strong execution. Revenues include about $5 million from the GPX acquisition and reflect updated FX rates. We expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA margins, before integration costs to be greater than 47% and now include about $3 million from GPX Acquisition and reflect updated FX rates. We expect to spend $80 million of integration costs in 2021. And we expect 2021 AFFO to grow 10% to 11% on a normalized and constant currency basis compared to the prior year and to deliver AFFO per share growth of 9% to 10%. Our AFFO guidance includes some AFFO impacting accelerated spend, including recurring CapEx, an elevated cash commissions associated with our strong bookings performance. 2021 CapEx is expected to range between $2.7 billion and $3 billion including about $450 million of on-balance sheet xScale CapEx, a significant portion of which has been or will be reimbursed by the JVs, and $193 million of recurring CapEx spend at the midpoint. So let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles. Why don't I take the first one? And then, I think, Charles might take the second one. As it relates to -- the deal structuring between PGIM and GIC is very similar. In many ways the construct was developed off of contracting structure with the GIC while we work ed with PGIM. Again, delighted to have another partner in a different market in support of our Australian business. As it relates to our ability -- to the performance this quarter, again, as you've heard from some of our prior calls we basically sold out most of the capacity that we've delivered to market. And so we're very eager to continue our builds. We have eight builds currently underway in xScale, and the team is working very hard to identify customer appropriate customers for that capacity plus more. So I'll just leave you with is an exciting time for us in the xScale space. We're putting the money, the work, and as Charles alluded to in his prepared remarks and was $7.5 billion of capital is going to be deployed across 34 assets. And it's -- we still have more to talk about. So why don't I leave it there and just recognize that xScale in of itself right now is not a big component of our revenues or AFFO. But it does create some lumpiness that you've seen in the non-recurring line, which we highlighted in our prepared remarks Q4, we just don't expect as much of that non-recurring revenue as we've seen before. But certainly as we look into '22 and beyond, those start to see that step-up again from a non-recurring perspective. Then you also see more of the recurring piece come into play for xScale. The other thing I would just say, Charles and Richard, remember this region's 75% utilized, so we have substantial amount of capacity that we have built and we continue to build in core markets. And the other thing I'd just -- as Charles alluded to, normally the focus that we have on the right customers, that our sales leadership team in the Americas and beyond are doing such a great job of selling the platform. And so the opportunity that we said -- that we talked about inter-region and intra -region is very real. So overall very optimistic about what we're seeing in the Americas region. Could you repeat that? Is a drag, the timing of what? Well, first and foremost, as Charles alluded to in the end, we will -- just an outstanding quarter again from a bookings perspective. And more particularly in the Americas region. And as we just sort of talked about, the Americas enjoy the highest pricing environment. So there's a number of things that are going on. Part of it is sure timing, but it is also the conversion of our backlog into a billable cabinet that will make a big difference here. And so, there's nothing that I would say overly extraordinary other than we're just seeing overall momentum of the business continues to scale. Churn starting as abated or is abating, and then you've got a good price point with your inventory. This way we could be booked, sorry, netbook. Go from backlog into a billing item. [Indiscernible] Well said. Well, there was a reference in the prepared remarks just to talk about Canadian business is better than our -- it's doing better than we originally anticipating. Good on the team, and they're also selling global platform out of Canada into our other assets around the world. As it specifically relates to the Americas business, I think it's very good back to some of the fundamentals that Charles alluded to. We're targeting the right customers with the right applications and putting in the right places. And at the same, by the same token, we've got an inventory set that they really caters to a diverse set of customers across, across the U.S. or the Americas as a whole. And so between the assets we serve, the customers we target, and the delivery of services that are additive to co-location interconnection, I just think we're in a much better space. Our position and as a result, we are going to win more than our fair share of the businesses out there. And so Colby I just wanted to go back to again a couple of other questions. So there's 2 things that I felt I heard you ask.1. is what's happening quarter-over-quarter. What's going on in Q4? And there was a reference that we made and that we accelerated some costs into this year, so that's number one both from our recurring CapEx perspective and some operating spend. And we did that for a number of reasons, and part of it is supply chain specific. The other part is we alluded to in the prepared remarks. When you look at AFFO in and of itself, Q4 is historically one of our lower performing AFFO quarters. That's why we don't guide on a quarterly basis, we gave you the annual number and say, this is what we will do, and we recognize things will move around, but the reality is Q4 always tends to be a higher recurring CapEx quarter, and that's what you're seeing in the guide that we've delivered at a $193 million at midpoint. So it gives you a real sense. It's a big step-up in our recurring CapEx for Q4. The other thing is, as we have said, that we have had a lot of success in the business and as a result, the cash payout attributed to commissions that is more substantial than we originally anticipated in Q4, and that's reflected in the guidance. And that's AFFO impacting on EBITDA impacting it, so there's a lot of nuances. But overall, when you look at the fundamental business, it's performed better than we anticipated. For every single quarter of the year, we're delivering against the expectations we have set. And as you -- I think, you know well that we based our guide both on revenue EBITDA and AFFO throughout the year. And we're at a point now where we feel comfortable and now we're focusing on 2022. And that's where the energy of the business is again focused on."

            "name": "Charles Meyers",
            "content": "Thanks, Kat. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We had a great quarter, achieving our 75th consecutive quarter of top line revenue growth and a record Q3. A clear signal of strong market demand. Our results were fueled by continued strength in our Americas business and robust performance for our channel program globally as key partners continue to see Platform Equinix as a point of nexus for digital transformations solutions. The pandemic has triggered and accelerated need to digitize business models in virtually every segment of the economy. And our strong results reflect its increasing demand for digital infrastructure and Equinix remains uniquely positioned to help customers as they shift towards distributed, hybrid, and multi-cloud as clear architecture of choice. As we continue to strengthen our position as the world digital infrastructure Company, our focus remains on creating distinctive and durable value for our customers and our shareholders, driving growth in scale and our market-leading colocation franchise, expanding our relevance in Cloud ecosystem through xScale, and tapping into massive sources of incremental demand by adapting to evolving customer needs with our rapidly growing digital services business. Turning to our results as depicted on Slide 3. Revenues for Q3 were $1.7 million, up 8% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA was up 4% year-over-year, and the AFFO was in line with our expectations. Interconnection revenues continued to outpace colocation revenues, growing 11% year-over-year, driven by solid fiscal cross connect growth and broad adoption of Equinix power. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. We process more than 4,200 yields in the quarter across more than 3,100 customers highlighting the reach, scale and predictability of our booking digits. We have a solid demand pipeline as we look in the final quarter of the year, and we continue to add capacity in services demand with 11 major projects delivered this quarter in key markets like Frankfurt, New York, and Singapore, and 31 more major projects underway across 23 markets in 16 countries. Our global interconnection franchise continues to thrive with over 414,000 total interconnections on our industry-leading platform. In Q3, we added an incremental 7,800 interconnections now have at least 1 major cloud on-ramping, 42 metros around the world, 2 times more than the nearest competitor. A clear indication that Equinix is the home of the interconnected cloud. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 6% quarter-over-quarter, and 30% year-over-year to over 21 terabits per second, as traffic growth remains robust. Equinix Fabric saw excellent growth continuing significantly over index within the broader interconnection portfolio. More than 2,800 customers are now on Fabric, attach rates moving up into the right as businesses diversify their end destinations and service providers integrate Fabric into their own solutions. In September, we extended Platform Equinix into our 27th country, with the close of our GPX acquisition, entering the strategic Indian market. Our 2 data centers in Mumbai form a network-dense campus with more than 350 international and local companies, including 6 on-ramps to the world's leading Cloud service providers and a robust network ecosystem. GPX represents an ideal entry point into this top 10 GDP country, and we expect to expand our operations significantly in India over the coming years as we tap into this rapidly growing market. In parallel with our tremendous retail success, we continue to expand our xScale business. In October, we announced plans to expand in Australia with an agreement to establish a $575 million in joint venture with PGIM real estate to develop two data centers in Sydney, which will provide more than 55 megawatts of capacity when fully built. Also, during the quarter, we closed the first phase of our previous slide-outs to [Indiscernible] joint venture with GIC and signed 2 megawatts with the hyperscalers in Frankfurt. We currently have 8 xScale built under development, including our newly announced [Indiscernible] 3, Mexico C3 and Sydney 9 assets, which will collectively added 25 megawatts capacity when they open in the first half of 2022. The total investment of our various hyper-scale joint ventures when closed and fully built-out, is now expected to be more than $7.5 billion across 34 facilities globally with more than 675 megawatts of power fast. Turning our [Indiscernible] recharge services, our Equinix 's metal business saw strong revenue growth at Cloud-native and service provider customers continue to embrace the ability to deploy physical infrastructure at software speed. And network-edge is our robust growth as established customers purchase more virtual network functions across additional metrics. By year-end, we expect network-edge to be available in 25 metros around the world. So let me cover highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical continues to be a foundation for the business. With strength in the quarter in cable and satellite sub-segments and continued momentum in joint go-to-market with our top net with partners across the globe. Expansions this quarter included Zayo Group, a global communications infrastructure Company adding interconnection and colocation capacity to support demand, Vocus, Australia's leading specialist fiber and network solutions provider, building infrastructure in both Sydney and Melbourne to offer network services, and Hurricane Electric, a global network service provider, utilizing Equinix Fabric to allow Enterprise customers to access their IP transit products at scale and in real-time. Our enterprise vertical saw another strong quarter led by manufacturing in FinTech and record channel activity. New wins and expansions included a Fortune 100 -named manufacturing Company, deploying global network hubs to enable their stats analytics offering, a leading technology manufacturer deploying a custom-liquid cooled environment and solution center to support the next-generation of high performance compute, and a Fortune 250 online retailer and e-commerce platform, deploying across Platform Equinix with low latency, cloud-adjacent network hubs to support their retail branded sites. Our cloud and IT verticals saw particular strength in the Americas, as industry-specific cloud solutions continue to be a catalyst for innovation and new growth. Expansion this quarter included Adobe, a leading cloud software provider, deploying infrastructures towards platforms and optimize sustainable participation in key digital markets and ecosystems. Wasabi, a U.S. based object storage Company expanding their offering on Equinix Fabric into APAC and EMEA, enabling customers to easily connect their bare metal workflows posted on Equinix Metal, and a top 5 global software provider deploying core metals to support their growing user base in demand in both Mexico City and Sao Paulo. Content and digital media had a great bookings quarter with resurgence in this vertical being led by APAC and broad-based strength in the gaming and streaming sub-segments as consumer demand for at-home digital services remains strong. Expansion this quarter included Netflix, a global streaming services spanning across Platform Equinix to new and existing markets to support OTT delivery, Kingsoft, a Chinese cloud provider expanding into sand port to support rapid sales growth, and a top 3 content distributor extending coverage and scale for its growing platform in the delivery of new and existing security solutions. And our channel program continues to shine, delivering another robust quarter. This important go-to-market notion accounted for over 35% of total bookings, nearly half of our enterprise bookings in more than 60% of our new logos in the quarter. We are benefiting from tremendous momentum in hybrid cloud adoption and seeing particular strength from joint enterprise pursuits with our key alliance partners such as AT&T, AWS, Dell, HPE, and Microsoft. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and included a marquee win with NVIDIA, IBM, and SBA for Continental Group, a worldwide automotive parts supplier billion - interconnected global network to optimize workloads and speed up AI training for their advanced driver assistance systems. So now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Thanks, Keith. Our business continues to perform exceptionally well delivering strong and consistent results throughout the changing times. The pandemic has been a driving force for digital transformation and as businesses seek to respond to this imperative, the infrastructure underpinning these services must keep pace. We continue to prosecute multiple compelling growth factors, expanding our platform geographically, scaling our go-to-market engine to capture new customers, and bringing new services to bear that will expand our addressable market. We're evolving the way we design, create, and deliver our products and services to fuel our growth and meet the changing needs of our customers. To that end, I'd also like to welcome Ron Guerrier to our Board of Directors. As a veteran CIO to Fortune 500 corporations and government, Ron brings a unique perspective to the Equinix board as we continue to innovate our digital infrastructure offerings for the digital leaders of today and tomorrow. I'd like to close by expressing my gratitude to our more than 10,000 employees, whose commitment to keep our customers at the center of everything we do continues to drive our market leadership. They embody our commitment to show up every day with an in-service to mindset, starting by being in service to each other, which in turn allows us to be in service to our customers, to our communities, and to you, our shareholders. So let me stop there and open it up for questions. Sure, yes, I mean,-- I think we're seeing strength across the board, but really the enterprise side of the business, I think is where a lot of the new customer ads are coming from. And most of those, about 60% are coming through channel, as we talked about in the script. So we're seeing a big uptick that said more than 35% percent of the bookings coming through the channel. And I think it's been really encouraging, We're really seeing strength with our top channel partners and really our top alliance partners in particular, who are really engaged in joint enterprise pursuit with us. In terms of pursuing hybrid multi-cloud opportunities and people implementing hybrid architectures. And so -- in fact, I'll give you a start. We had our top 4 alliance partners in this quarter accounted for 10% of the total bookings. And that's not 10% of the channel book, is that 10% of the total bookings. So really strong momentum with the channel partners and it's across a number of verticals and it's across a number of use cases, but real strength in terms of how people are thinking about using corporate data to draw insights, how they, therefore, want to store that data centrally, act on it from a variety of cloud resources, and then, also AI as a key driver. In fact, we had a big win -- big joint win with NVIDIA on that front as we talked about in the script, and so really great progress there, and I think the range of use cases is really strong. We had -- in fact we had an event today that we call Connects (ph) that was -- we had I think about 500 registrations for that event -- for enterprises talking about a variety of use cases implemented on Fabric and so we're seeing some really good momentum. Again, I do think that that's a durable trend. I would always comment that there's some potential lumpiness in churn at times. But I think if you look at the trend line on that, it's been the line of best fit is clearly downward there. And so we've had a good year. And as we said, we expect our full-year churn to be toward the bottom end of the range that we talked about, %2 to %2.5. And I think the big driver of that is really mix of business. We're getting the right time deployments, right kinds of customers, right kind of use cases. And I think that's a lot of credit to our sales and marketing team in terms of what they're doing from a targeting perspective, and to our commercial teams in terms of how we're really sort of focusing the business. I do think it's durable and I think that's going to be a -- continue to be a key driver in the business going forward. Sure. I'll start and then Keith can jump in if he wants to add anything, but I'd say this, other than some small 1-time items on the power side that had a slight impact on our Q4 guide, we're seeing power cuts pretty much come in where we expected for the remainder of the year and into early next year, I think there's more going to be the longer-term volatility into 2022 that we're really looking at. But as you said, similar to currency we've got a pretty extensive hedging program that really feathers in our hedges over a multiyear period. And we're about 85% hedged in the unregulated markets which represent most of our largest markets. And so our contracts do allow for us to adjust pricing based on underlying costs. And we're actively working to implement adjustments where we think that's appropriate. But, again, you guys, I think recognize our businesses is different in they were more heavily circuit based on our power mix. So whereas it's a little more seamless and pass through those costs in immediate power environment, takes a little more finesse to do that in the circa base power environment. But I would say that we act -- as I've said, we're actively working that in terms of how to do it. And I'd say that our experience in Europe with the cross-connect pricing increases over the last couple of years, really give us some confidence that we'll be able to go get that done effectively. So no doubt there's more volatility in the energy markets. So we're watching those closely, and we're going to continue to adapt our strategies accordingly. About 80% of the -- about 80% of the portfolio is circuit based. And again, that's been a key to our -- that's part of our overall return story. We've been very effective in terms of driving sort of aggregate returns across space and power because of that circuit based power component of the business, and so in terms of its really more a matter of how effective can we be in terms of passing through price increases, underlying costs increase increases in the form of price to the circuit based power environment. So again, we have the contractual ability to do that, and it's just a matter of whether we -- I do think it won't be like circuit power we're going to where we are going to get every bit of that path. So but I think that we'll look at that market-by-market and assess what the rate approaches. Jon, on the other ones, I say want. Look, I haven't been -- I'm an optimist because I have never been, I guess on the business, how it's performing, what the magnitude of the opportunity ahead is. A little bit of noise in the quarter here, but I think that we had a -- we continue -- the business continues to perform. The fundamentals are very strong. 8,000 [Indiscernible] been added to add in the quarter, 3,000 billable cab ads, record bookings really for the past 3 quarters, at least seasonally adjusted in terms of this is our best Q3 ever. This quarter great degree predictability turn, as I said, at the low-end firm pricing, we added another quarter of positive pricing adjustments that Keith talked about in the script and continue to see good momentum on our new markets. And if you look at big markets that we're relatively earlier entering in in terms of -- think places like Mexico and now India. Huge opportunities in front of us there to over-indexing growth in those markets. And then digital services is really -- Our customers are responding really well to those products even though they're at an earlier stage growth. So I think as I look into 2022 in terms of headwinds, tailwinds, etc, feel really good about the bookings momentum, feel really good about the pricing in our relevance to customers and therefore our ability to support firm price points. A churn looks good, good deal mix is going to continue to be absolutely key to maintaining that. As I said, I think the headwinds more on making sure that we continue to -- we talked a little bit about power as a potential headwind there in some areas. We talked about, I think continuing to drive operational efficiencies in the business is going to be a key focus for us to drive operating leverage. And then continuing to work backlog. I think we've got a big backlog partially because we've got some big deals that have gone into that. We got to continue to work through that backlog, certain deal types, tab slightly longer book-to-bill. And I think we're seeing that as part of the complexity of implementing these more multi-vendor, hybrid multi-cloud kind of deals. And so we're continuing to sort of hone our capabilities there. So if we can continue to drive those things, I think we will be able to really take advantage of the bookings momentum that's there. And obviously, we'll give you a color on all of that as we go into the 2022 guide. Yeah. A great question, Jon. I would say that we're continuing to learn in that area and we're accelerating our kind of investment of energy in the -- understanding that landscape. And at the same time we are -- we're still digesting and learning some of the business around digital services and how to adapt our approach and build capabilities both from -- evolved capabilities, both from a design and development perspective, as well as from a deployment and go-to-market perspective. And so we're continuing to honor our -- cut our teeth there and really learn those things in that market. But I do think there are real opportunities there. And so we'll be continue to be active in that area in terms of looking at potential opportunities, both to add talent and technology and capabilities, and really learning that landscape better over the course of this year and next year and beyond. Hey, Richard, but I hope that party continues for a while. I would tell you I think we feel pretty good about that business. Again, we certainly have -- we spend more quarters than I would like talking about when the Verizon term was going to abate. And so I'm loving talking about the other side of that now. We're really the scale of that business, tremendous sales execution in the region, both for bookings into the region as well as global bookings to the platform elsewhere. I would say we feel really good about the performance of the America's region right now and expect that growth rate is going to continue to persist at elevated levels. And then so we feel good about that fact. I think driving attach rates now to continue to increase the share of wallet with our very, very large customer base and bringing them some of our new services is some of the new area of focus and really leveraging our channel partners to do that. So anything to add Keith Well, I mean, I think it was -- I guess you'd have to obviously, you've been in the story for a long time, Richard has been, but I think there was a period of time when we had elevated churn associated with really honing our customer mix and our core competitive advantages and making sure that we were focused on those that would say that was back in the early days I was here in the 2011-12 time frame, when we really set about honing our sales process and driving greater deal commercial scrutiny, etc. And I think that -- so we had a little bit of elevated turn as we work through that process. And then we had a little bit during the period of time when we digested some of the Verizon assets. We talked about the fact that we're a few -- several quarters ago, where we had deals that candidly just we're outside of the traditional sweet spot that we would be focused on. And I think it's the right long-term value creating decision for us to let those kind of things go and use that space and net capacity for advancing the strategy that we're really focused on. And so now, you're seeing that, and as I've always said, the most -- the best -- the best way to avoid losing a deal is to get the right deal in the door to begin with, and so that's what our focus is. I think our sales teams are really doing an exceptional job on that. Our new sales leader [Indiscernible] in the U.S. is just a dynamite sales leader doing an incredible job, and he's got a great leadership team across the board there. And so I got to give some credit [Indiscernible] to our [Indiscernible] in America. It's just a great team really driving that thing. Sure. I mean, when we say firm pricing, one of the big things we've talked about it is when we had net positive pricing actions in the quarter. So we essentially take what we're getting in terms of uplifts on our pricing accelerators if you will increase -- price increases that are contractually built in. We offset that against any potential downward movement that might occur on a release. Our business tends to move it a little bit of a saucy within that. It's -- we'll see these price escalators over kind of 3 to 5-year contract. We'll get a renewal that might have some summary rates. And then, we will kind of go through that cycle again. But in any given quarter, we're seeing those positive pricing -- overall positive pricing adjustments. And that's just, I think, a reflection of our ability to sustain those higher price points. As you can see in the Americas, actually in all of the world, we've been sort of moving MRR per cab up into the right for a long period of time. We've seen some really strong moving in EMEA over the last couple of years because of the interconnection price increasing. I think we were slightly down in the U.S. on a constant currency basis, but that often and depend on the timing of installs and those kind of things, and so -- I mean, 23.93 per cab is just an exceptional number. And so I think if you look at that relative to the rest of the industry, I think you would find it to be sort of far, far away, but the best kind of yield in the industry itself. And so in terms of normalizing that for large footprint, we really aren't doing any really large footprint in the U.S. We occasionally will do an anchor deal in a facility, but we're not really active in the hyperscale or xScale space in the U.S. And we've talked about why that is in the past. And if you look at -- even in the other markets, we're doing that now almost strictly through the xScale business and through the joint venture. And so, that's not rolling in to the results that you see here, that really only rolls into our core financials in the form of fees and other things that we think are quite creative to the overall financial picture. So that's kind of picture on pricing. Pricing, I think on xScale continues to be competitive certainly, which is why returns in that business are a little lower but that's also why we decided to go do this through joint ventures where 80% of that capital is through a financial partner. Sure. So I'd start by saying that generally, I think our team has done a just an exceptional job navigating the current realities as it relates to supply chain around the world that our bottom-line message has been and continues to be that we really aren't seeing any meaningful negative impacts to our business. But that doesn't just magically happen. It happens by our team doing really great work to go and make sure that we are mitigating the risks that are out there. The way I -- Chuck, we talked about it internally is really 4 kind of levels to the supply chain potential risks. The first one is really facility level or in other words, are there -- are those constraints out there impacting our ability to deliver projects on time and on budget? And while we've seen some modest level of delays on a few projects, those are typically actually more associated with COVID delays and they are supply-chain candidly. As Keith noted in his script, we've actually taken on some inventory or contractual forward commits to the tune of about a $100 million, that is giving us the confidence to be able to make sure that we can deliver our projects on time. That combined with the fact that we've got a huge number of projects underway. And they are all over the world and we can move separate around. Typically, it's fundable between sort of projects. And so the team, the construction team, the procurement team, the sourcing team have just done a phenomenal job in terms of mitigating that, in terms of IBX availability and the delivery timelines. The next level on -- is really at the services level. In other words, our underlying services check there. Our network-related services like Fabric, Connect, etc. and Metal are we -- do we have the capacity to support the forecast there? And what we've done there is we've just forward purchased several quarters of capacity to give us the confidence that we can support that. And so feeling good about that as well. The third level is really deployment level. In other words, cage materials and other things that are needed as people build out their cages. We've also stockpiled there. Occasionally, there are circumstances where people have non-standard items that caused delays. But if they're sticking within the middle of the bell curve in terms of what their needs are, we're not seeing delays there. And then customer level delays is sort of the last level, which is our customers delayed in terms of getting their IT equipment to loan into deployments. And if not, are they delaying or asking for delays for commencement and those kind of things? And again, while we've seen a few of those things, they just -- in the grand seal -- scope of things and in the scale of our business are just not particularly meaningful. So there's some, there's probably a little bit of pressure on costs in some areas. We've been able to take advantage of our scale and I think to mitigate that, we're continuing to -- people often asked the question as to whether cost to build as inflationary or not, I would tell you that I think we've been able to keep up with it from a design standpoint and continuing to optimize our designs faster than costs are going up, so we're trying to keep ahead of the game there, but I think our team has done a really terrific job of managing those things. And I do think that we're -- we expect that things will start to stabilize over the course of 2022 from a supply chain perspective. So long answer there, but hopefully that gives you some perspective. I'm sorry, from an M&A perspective, I would say we are -- we continue to think there's opportunity out there, I mean, we talked -- I think John asked question about M&A in the -- in sort of the digital services side on the business. But there's also, we think continued opportunity in terms of extending our reach and looking for critical assets in the market that might be accretive to our strategy. And so, and we've got the balance sheet, the firepower to go after those kinds of things. And so we will continue to be active as appropriate. They're always with a high degree of certainty on getting the right deals. Great questions by for sure, I would say on the network side, I'd say it's a mixed bag. I think that there is a movement towards people viewing third-party facilities, particularly facilities like Equinix, where there's large degrees of aggregation as logical places to put portions of their core infrastructure. That said, I think these companies are also have a long history of building on in their own facilities and I think that is -- and there are still a lot of forces within those companies that want that to continue. And so I think we've been very active on the business development front and we have seen some success there. And in terms of how they think about putting certain portions of their core 5G infrastructure, for example, into our facilities. And we have the Dallas approved concept center there that we've been actively working with both equipment providers as well as service providers on sort of proving out some of those potential value propositions. So I think we're still -- that will happen over a lot of long core stem. I do think we're more successful with people who are coming into those markets as disruptors because they think differently about it. And so -- and I do think there are some pretty interesting opportunities there. And we're working with a few -- I wanted -- I want to say the names right now, but I'm not sure that they are public, yeah that I can't, so I won't. But there are some interesting things going on there. As to the tower side, we've been -- we believe there is some synergy between sort of companies that have broad-based real estate assets that are proximate to communications infrastructure, which is sort of the definition of tower companies, and I can see why and understand why they may have an interest in data center assets and how they fit in potentially to their portfolio. But I would tell you that for the most part, we see a strong demand for traffic at the edge there too. A very significant majority of that traffic could go back to the aggregated edge. And that's really our sweet spot. That's where our differentiation is. Definitely there are use cases that were mobile edge compute, out further. Things like shop for automation and those kind of things. I think they are real use cases that 5G is going to be able to accelerate and we're certainly keeping our eyes on that and the active there from a business development standpoint. But I do think that -- I think it's more likely that we would partner in some way with those folks over time. It's not necessarily obvious to me that those have to live under the same ownership structure. But I think we will just have to continue to see how the markets play out. Keith, I don't know if you have a different view on that? Well, I think that when people start cutting each others throats on pricing. It will be real hard. It's not -- I mean, it's still a very competitive market, I think. And so I think that's different in terms of if you look at the broad Americas because I think there is opportunities in last and for us. Obviously, we already announced projects in Brazil I think we bring certain different, some very distinctive advantages there. I do think there is a ton of demand and as we've always said, we're not, we're not going to say we're religiously out of the business of doing that, but I think it would have to be under a special set of circumstances in terms of why we think that fits with the strategy. Because we're -- a strategy as you'll recall, is that we wanted to use those as opportunities to further our position in the cloud ecosystem, continue to invest in the relationship with the major cloud service providers, and broader set of hyperscalers and use that to create this advantage overall position in cloud ecosystem. We feel very good about our position, particularly in the U.S., and whether or not the xScale would be particularly accretive to that, I think is an open question. But we're not -- we're definitely not -- it's not out of the question that we would do that. I just think it's -- I think right now there are a lot of opportunities for us in other markets that we think are more attractive. Good questions Colby. We will be able to give you all the answers there, but I would say and obviously we're not going to kind of give you a 2022 guys. But I would say that you're -- generally I would say we continue to feel good about the momentum in the business from a bookings and demand perspective, I think that we did talk about driving efficiencies and I think the pursuit of the 50% margin target is something we continue to be focused on and that's an area where we continue to have worked -- knew exactly at what pace we can do that, and what that implies for the 2022 margin. I don't know. And I do think it will require us to dig in deeper on power. And I don't think we're yet in a position where we can quantify any of that for you other than -- in terms of the hedging that we -- I mean, they are multiyear hedges, but they're feathered in. And so obviously do become less impactful as you look further out. And so I do think that there's more risk as you go out, but I think the good part of that is that it gives us time to determine what our approach is going to be to passing those costs through and assessing how to do that and to what degree. That is how much of a recovery we can see there, and we don't know the answers to all those things, and so I think we're going to track those, we're going to look at the markets where there's volatility. And I think that's something where unfortunately I think we'll just have to come back to you when we look into -- as we look into 2022 guide, and give you more perspective about that. Hey, Frank. Yes, as I said earlier, I think that business has a strong trajectory. I think we expect that to continue, we don't see this as a temporary improvement. I think we're as a business, moving in a very solid direction. Strong demand from customers, good sales execution, and again we don't expect that -- and again, churn mitigating, getting the right customers right deals. I think that will continue to drive strong performance from that region. Which, obviously, is a pretty major driver of our overall performance. Yeah, I think as to whether it really accelerates, I think we have to continue to look at our success in driving new services revenues and what the rate of new customer capture and attaches and those kind of things. But again, I think we feel really good about where the business is right now and feel like that's a sustainable growth rate for us."

At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thanks, Kate. Good afternoon, everybody and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As reflected in our results we are seeing significant momentum in our business as digital transformation outpaces previous expectations. Technology span is accelerating and Equinix remains uniquely positioned as traditional technology markets continue to shift as a service consumption models and hybrid multi-cloud is widely adopted as the architecture of choice. The pandemic is highlighted divisional infrastructure is not just a business enabler, but a primary source of competitive advantage for digital leaders across all industries. And we continue to see a multitude of trends driving infrastructure that is more distributed or on demand and more ecosystem connected than ever before, playing to our distinctive strengths. Our results reflect strong performance across our geographies, tremendous momentum in our market leading interconnection franchise and deep customer demand across our expanding portfolio of services. Against this robust demand backdrop, we had a great second quarter, delivering record bookings, fueled by continued momentum in our Americas business and strong quarter of Equinix metal. We processed more than 4600 deals in the quarter across more than 3200 customers, demonstrating both the scale and the consistency of our go-to-market machine. We achieved our 74th consecutive quarter of top-line growth and are pleased to have been recently been included in the Fortune 500, an exciting milestone made possible by the confidence our customers place on Equinix, and by the incredible commitment and passion of our 10,000 plus employees around the world. And we continue to expand our global platform with 35 projects underway across 25 markets in 19 countries, with Q2 openings in Bordeaux, Helsinki in Silicon Valley. Aligned with our values and our purpose, we're also proud to share further enhancements to our old commitments on sustainability, leading in across all elements of ESG. In early June, we became the first in the data center industry to commit to being Climate Neutral by 2030, backed by science-based targets an aggressive green financing plan and a comprehensive sustainability agenda. Aligned with the Paris Climate Agreement, this commitment is a critical step to ensuring Equinix continues to advance investments and innovations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and greening our customers digital supply chains. Additionally, as part of our ongoing focus on diversity, inclusion and belonging and our commitment to wellbeing we recently hosted our second annual WeConnect event, a 24-hour virtual gathering led by our employees, our employee connection networks and our VIV [ph] and wellbeing teams. This event celebrates quality, diversity and connection and offers our employees an opportunity to listen to learn and to engage in courageous conversations as we build a culture and a community, that can have a meaningful sustainable impact on the future of our world. Turning to our results as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q2 were $1.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 7% year-over-year and FFO was again meaningfully ahead of our expectations. Interconnection revenues grew 12% year-over-year, the solid unit ads and healthy pricing. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our global interconnection franchise continues to perform well. We now have over 406,000 total interconnections on our industry leading platform. In Q2, we added an incremental 7800 interconnections and now has 15 macros with more than 10,000 total interconnections. A reflection of the scale digital ecosystems that drive our differentiated value proposition. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 31% year-over-year, and we're seeing IBX diversify as largescale period expands to a broader base of enterprise customers. Equinix Fabric saw excellent growth across all three regions, driven by healthy unit growth and increasing yields as customers expand usage of higher bandwidth connections to interconnect regional and global footprints. More than 2600 customers are now on Fabric, and we continue to see strong attach rates as businesses diversify their end destinations and evolve their connectivity needs in support of highly distributed infrastructure and the adoption of hybrid multi-cloud. Turning to digital infrastructure services, customers are responding very positively as we augment our portfolio to enable physical infrastructure delivered at software speed. We have strong bookings of Equinix metal this quarter, including our largest link today with our channel partner Alarm [ph] for a blockchain company building a network of validation nodes across eight markets. Our network edge offering shows meaningful acceleration, with average deal size increasing nicely as enterprise customers are deploying a diverse set of virtualized network functions from our marketplace of vendors. Importantly, and as expected, digital infrastructure services are also driving strong cross-selling activity and interconnection pull through, with nearly 1000 virtual connections already provisioned to support these deployments. Shifting to our xScale initiative, we continue to expand our plans in light of robust market demand and positive customer feedback. Late in the quarter, we announced agreements for additional joint ventures in the GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund. When closed and fully built out the total investment between Equinix and GIC and our xScale datacenter portfolio will be nearly $7 billion across 32 facilities globally with more than 600 megawatts of power capacity. We currently have 7 xScale builds under development across all three regions, we prelease our entire Frankfurt nine asset in Q2, representing 18 megawatts of capacity fully committed in advance of delivery. With this field, we now have leased more than 100 megawatts of xScale capacity and 100% of our open capacity at lease. We're actively engaged with partners to develop entry plans and other expansion markets globally, including Australia. Now I'll cover highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical delivered strong bookings across all three regions, with particular strength and APAC as traditional carriers continue to invest in specialty telecom firms evolve their portfolios to address demand for cloud, mobile IP services and over the top delivery. New wins and expansions this quarter included [Indiscernible], a local telecom service provider, leveraging interconnection to better serve low latency financial customers. Crosslake Fibre a leading provider of network services deploying in our London for compared to 7 IBXs is to support the first new subsea cable laid across the English Channel in nearly 20 years. And a global telecommunications provider expanding their presence to new locations including Milan and Bordeaux. Our cloud and IT vertical saw continued momentum over indexing in Europe as organizations accelerate hybrid multi-cloud adoption. Expansion this quarter includes Zoom, leading video communications platform, expanding coverage and scale to support market demand. And a cloud delivered enterprise network security provider deploying infrastructure to support offerings in new locations. Our enterprise vertical achieved record bookings, with broad global strength punctuated by an exceptionally strong quarter in the Americas across several sub-segments, including healthcare, consumer services, business and professional services and retail. New wins and expansions including Redbull, a major sports energy drink manufacturer deploying infrastructure across all three regions to take advantage of Equinix's cloud ecosystem. A leading global cosmetics retailer deploying digital infrastructure to optimize their network, move out of legacy data centers and locate private infrastructure adjacent to their cloud providers. And a Fortune 500 Global insurance provider optimizing their infrastructure to support multi-cloud. Content and digital media also achieve solid bookings led by growth and CDN, publishing and digital media and gaming, as digital transformation continued to shape this vertical. Expansions include StackPath, a leading edge computing and services provider deploying infrastructure across multiple edge locations, Ernest Research a leading data analytics company is transforming network topology and interconnect into multiple files across platform Equinix, and i3d.net, a leading provider of application hosting and infrastructure services deployed on platform Equinix to enable a consistent high performance gaming experience globally. And our channel program continues to outperform, delivering a record quarter and accounting for over 35% of bookings. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals, and use cases including multiple Equinix metal and network edge deals. As the channel embraces our digital infrastructure services. We saw continued strength from Alliance partners like AWS, Cisco, Dell, Google, IBM, and Microsoft. And we also had success with key retailers around the world, including a win with HPE, the Rollers Group, a leading Australian retailer to modernize and scale their payments platform, which processes over 30 million transactions per day. So now let me turn the call over to Keith and cover results report.\nKeith Taylor: Thanks, Charles. And good afternoon to everyone. I hope you and your families are well and enjoying summer months. So let me start by saying it was great to spend time with many of you albeit virtually, at our June Analyst Day state. No surprise, we were eager to share our plans on how we intend to scale, extend and innovate the business over the coming years to drive long-term shareholder value, meaning more revenues, higher margins and more cash flows. With respect to the quarter the business continues to perform exceedingly well. At the macro environment, digital infrastructure continues to drive favorable demand. In fact, we exceeded our expectations. There are many highlights to share with you from the quarter. To start, we had record bookings activity at both the company and the American regional level. We enjoyed robust channel activity along with planned shared. Interconnection additions were solid with physically and virtually. And our digital infrastructure service lines which include edge and metal are gaining momentum. Simply put, we're continuing to execute against the goals highlighted at the Analysts Day. Given our performance, we're raising our guidance across each of revenues, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share for the year. Now let me cover the results for the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalizing constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q2 revenues were $1.658 billion up 8% over the same quarter last year, due to strong business performance across our platform led by the Americas region. And as expected non-recurring revenues increased quarter over quarter to 7% of revenues due to a meaningful step up an xScale joint venture fees in APAC and EMEA and custom installation work across all three regions. As you can appreciate, non-recurring revenues are inherently lumpy. And therefore, as a result, we expect the Q3 non-recurring revenues to decrease by $8 million compared to Q2. Our backlog of books, but yet to be built cabinets have increased slightly, despite the 4200 increase in building cabinets in the quarter. Q2 revenues, net of our FX searches included an $11 million benefits compared to our prior guidance rates. Total Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $797 million or 48% of revenues, up 7% over the same quarter last year, meaningfully outperforming our expectations due to strong operating performance and timing of spend. Q2 included a planned rebound of repairs and maintenance spending and higher utility costs relative to Q1. Q2 adjusted EBITDA net of our FX hedges includes a $6 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates and $4 million of integration costs. Total Q2 FFO was $632 million, including a $25 million recurring CapEx increase compared to the prior quarter above our expectations due to strong operating performance and more integration costs. Turning to our regional highlights, with full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC has the highest year-over-year revenue growth of 11% followed by the Americas and EEMA region both at 8%. EMEA revenue growth rate reflects the lapping of the significant interconnection price increases and other one-off positive adjustments from last year. We expect the EMEA growth rates return to normalize levels in Q4. The Americas region saw continued strength of our second consecutive quarter of record bookings at six of our seven largest markets improved over the prior year. Also, we're enjoying health, healthy booking activity across our smaller markets to including Atlanta, Austin, Denver and Seattle. Deals were focused on retail interconnected deployments with healthy pricing. And the Americas region also benefited from strong imports from the other two regions a reflection of our continued focus on platform sell. Our EMEA region have a strong quarter led by Dublin and Stockholm and our newly opened Bordeaux market, as well as high exports to the other two regions. Enterprises contributed approximately one third of the region's bookings, up significantly over the prior year. We're also seeing good momentum across our flat markets. And the EMEA region benefited from non-recurring revenues related to xScale fees earned from the prelease of our entire Frankfurt 9 and London 11 buildings, 37 megawatts of demand. And finally, the Asia-Pacific region had a solid quarter led by Singapore and Japan with strong regional bookings. Pricing for small and medium sized deals remain strong and we're seeing good traction with Equinix metal. APAC regions quarterly AMR growth was partially constrained due to COVID-related capacity delays in Singapore, a political uncertainty in our Hong Kong markets. And now looking at capital structure, please refer to Slide 8 and 9. We ended the quarter with cash of about $1.8 billion and our net debt leverage ratio is 3.8 times of Q2 annualized EBITDA, highlighting the financial flexibility and strategic advantage we have relative to anyone else in our space. In May we raised $2.6 billion, including in an incremental $1 billion in green notes. Biz Equinix is an overall investment grade issuance in late-2019, we've reduced our annualized interest expense by approximately $196 million, offset in part by the incremental debt capital raised. Our blended cost growth is now the lowest in the industry at approximately 1.7% and our weighted average maturity is nearly 10 years. We also raised $100 million of ATM equity in the quarter. We continue to expect to use both debt and equity to fund our future business needs with an increased lean towards debt capital. Turning to Slide 10 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $692 million, including recurring CapEx of $45 billion. We opened three new retail projects this quarter, including new IBXs in Bordeaux and Silicon Valley. We also purchased land for development in Frankfurt and Helsinki. Revenues from owned assets now represents 58% of our total revenue through the acquisition of our Singapore 3 IBX. On the xScale side of the business, after quarter end, we contributed a Dublin 5 asset to the EMEA joint venture and in return for net proceeds after our 20% equity contribution of $49 million. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 11. Our 153 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 86% utilized and generate a 27% cash on cash return on the gross PPE invested. Looking forward, we expect to exit the year closer to the top-end over our stabilized asset growth rate in part due to strong America's revenue growth. Please refer to Slides 12 through 16 for updated summary of 2021 guidance and bridges. Do note our 2021 guidance does not include any financial results related to the pending GPX India acquisition, which is expected to close in Q3. For the full year 2021, we're raising our revenue guidance by $50 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance by $27 million, primarily due to strong operating performance and favorable FX rates. Although slightly offset due to the timing of standards, we proactively pull forward expenditures to mitigate supply chain risks. This guidance implies a normalizing constant currency revenue growth rate of approximately 8% and midpoint compared to the prior year, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of greater than 47%. And given the operating momentum in the business, we're raising our 2021 AFFO guidance by $15 million going 10% to 12% on a normalizing constant currency basis, compared to the previous year, while also increasing our AFFO per share range. 2021 CapEx is now expected to range between $2.7 billion and $3 billion including an approximate $450 million of on balance sheet, xScale CapEx. A significant portion of which is expected to be reimbursed by either the current or future JVs and $193 million of recurring CapEx spend, a slight increase over the prior quarter due to timing of spend as we mitigate supply chain risks. So let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thanks, Keith. The momentum behind digital transformation is as robust as ever, and shows no signs of letting up. As the world's digital infrastructure company, Equinix plays a unique role in this evolving story and is positioned to be both a catalyst and a key beneficiary as we partner with customers to unlock the enormous promise of digital both economically and socially. As we discussed in our latest Analyst Day, say we are focused on three strategic levers as we execute on this transformational opportunity. First, we will continue to scale, doubling down on the strength of our core business, investing further scale our go-to-market machines to win new customers, putting our capital to work to add capacity in existing markets, and executing on targeted operations whether it's standardized simplified and automate. Driving expanded operating margins and providing a better experience for customers and partners. Second, we will extend the reach of our platform and accelerate our aspirations in xScale. By the end of this year, we'll be in 66 markets around the world and see continued opportunities for expansion and growth across the retail and xScale. And third, we will continue to innovate across our portfolio, scoring scalability, self-service and energy efficiency across our space [ph], delivering advanced features to sustain momentum in our market leading interconnection franchise and driving adoption of our digital infrastructure services to deepen our relevance to customers. Our ability to scale expand and innovate starts with our people. And with our commitment to building a diverse and inclusive workplace for every person, every day, you can confidently say I'm safe, I belong and I matter. We show up every day with an in service to mindset, starting by being in service to each other, which enables us in turn to be in service to our customers, to our communities, and to you, our shareholders. Purpose creates passion. And we are inspired by ours. To be the platform where the world comes together, serving as an enabling force for our customers in unlocking their incredible potential to deliver the innovations that enrich our work, our life and our planet. So let me stop there and open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open.\nJordan Sadler: Thank you, good afternoon. So during the Investor Day last month, you guys outline the 7% to 10% annual AFFO per share growth through 2025. But you also suggested that next year could come in in the lower half of the range. I think efficiency initiatives took some time to ramp and you didn't have as much benefit from refinancing opportunities that have taken place. Given the acceleration you're still seeing in this quarter and the bump you've seen here, can you can you speak to what the trajectory looks like heading into next year? And then certainly as a follow up and just curious about the ATM in the quarter. I think Keith, you talked about significant incremental debt capacity, given sort of leeway offered by the agencies. And so we expect to see the equity raise in the quarter? Thanks.\nKeith Taylor: Okay, great. Thank you for the questions. Let me take the first one, let me take the first question. First and foremost, when we came up at the Analyst Day, one of the questions we spent a lot of energy talking about was the AFFO per share growth rate in 2022 relative to the broader guide. The reason I said it was going to be in the bottom half of the range instead of the top half of the range was, one that was a reflection of all the investments we're making across our portfolio this year. Not only as it relates to xScale, but also our digital infrastructure services and then all the efficiency initiatives. So we were absorbing the full annualized impact of those costs in in 2022. As a result, it tends to cause us to be a little bit more dilutive on the per share metric relative to the broader guide. In addition, of course, we've got a very strong guide for this year as well. So we've had the benefit of refinancing out of the majority of our high yield debt. And so you've got a little bit of wind at your back and you won't have that wind to get back next year. So that's the primary reason. Relative to the comments we made about this year and raising our guide, probably not a big surprise to many of you, as we saw a lot of this coming in is reflected in their long-term model. That all said, we saw the ability to move our numbers up. But it's a five-year plan as you can appreciate. And so I wouldn't say that we're changing the trajectory on the guide for Analyst Day, just because we had one good quarter. That doesn't feel like the right thing to do. Secondly, as it relates to ATM. Like anything, we are going to use a little bit of debt and equity. This was really commensurate with our commitment to our rating agencies to tap periodically at ATM facility. But we've dramatically reduced what we anticipate that we would otherwise use. And as a result, you saw $100 million. But the message that I had in the prepared remarks was really the lean is towards debt capital on a go forward basis, for obvious reasons when the cost of bad debt capital and even over the last few weeks has continued to trend downwards. And so that will be a lien on a go forward basis. So there is always going to be a little bit of land. But again, I want to want to make sure that everybody fully appreciates. We want to use the debt capacity that we have on our balance sheet to its fullest advantage, but also at the same time maintaining a very positive relationship with a rating agencies.\nCharles Meyers: Yeah, I might augment this bit in terms of Jordan in terms of just saying, I think in the environment as attractive as I believe we're operating in now in terms of seeing so much growth opportunity for the business. I think the ability to continue to ensure that we have the ability to respond to that and the balance sheet to do so. It's just something is top of mind for us, as Keith said and the lien is definitely towards debt for the obvious reasons. But I think it probably makes sense for us to I think have some level of ATM, just to continue to have optionality in the business.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from David Guarino with Green Street. Your line is open, sir.\nDavid Guarino: Hey, thanks, guys. I want to ask you regarding the 3%, stabilized revenue growth in the quarter and your comments on the acceleration of that, through the rest of the year. Was actually due to the timing of when the Americas bookings hit during the quarter. So it would be a little bit higher? And could you just remind us of the top end of your stabilized growth rate?\nKeith Taylor: Sure, David, yeah, we've typically guide three to five. So we're kind of at the bottom lower end of that range this quarter. I think there are some timing effects in there and there's also some onetime items, I think that are flowing through. But as we really unpacked that and looked at what we expected, towards the back half of the year, I think we feel good about as sort of moving more towards the top end. And I think that's partially due to just really, obviously really strong continued momentum in the Americas business and out of the full portfolio of assets there. So, 8% percent quarter there, obviously some strong NRR in there. But even on the NRR side, 6% growth really strong quarter. And so I think towards the back half of the year, we're feeling really good about the trajectory there on the stabilized assets same store number.\nDavid Guarino: Okay. And then switching gears, you noted strong bookings in the Atlanta market. Could you comment on which data centers in that market saw the strong demand? And specifically, I guess could you come in if your 180 Peachtree datacenter is gaining any traction versus other properties in that market?\nKeith Taylor: Yeah, I mean, that's where our focus is. I believe the 51 and putting the energy in there and continuing to build that ecosystem, which we believe has the critical mass of interconnection and ecosystem depth that is really necessary to scale our market effectively. So yeah, we're seeing good success there and again, the emphasis is on that Peachtree location in Q1.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nSami Badri: Hi, thank you for the question. Charles, I have a question for you. And this is kind of going back a couple of quarters. I believe in the back half of 2020, you discussed that there was going to be an enterprise acceleration. And I know that dynamics now are actually picking up across the majority of the tech sector and we've seen some large-cap tech results that have reflect this, including your results. But, how would you describe your expectations in the back half of 2020? So what you're seeing right now? Is this coming in line or this coming ahead of what you were expecting in the back half of 2020?\nCharles Meyers: Yeah. As you indicated here, we were pretty optimistic and bullish about the momentum we were seeing with the enterprise customer, even during the more peak levels of the pandemic et cetera. And so we're seeing people, despite that saying, hey, we've got to be investing in digital. And so it will be showing up in terms of our pipeline build and, in our bookings, and just qualitatively in the conversations, we were having with customers. And so that's why we were kind of signaling that optimism. I think that is definitely translated how we expected it. And I would say that this quarter was even stronger than I think we would have thought it was going to be. And that's as reflected in our results and therefore, in the adaptation and our guide. And so I think the business, just a really strong quarter from enterprise perspective. As I said in the script, across all three regions across a variety of sectors, enterprise bookings, were very strong. [Indiscernible] channels a big part of that working not only in terms of pursuing hybrid cloud opportunities with our key alliance partners, and the cloud players, but also with our retailer portfolio partners. And so, yeah, I think we're seeing it in line or better than we had thought. And I think we expect to continue to see sustained output and growth from the enterprise segment and probably over indexing. Again, cloud and IT and enterprise have been over indexing for a very long time now. An enterprise just seems to be just on a tear in terms of its growth right now.\nSami Badri: Thank you for giving us color on that. One quick follow up. And I want to ask you this, because this is the question a lot about investors actually asked me. And where do you think enterprises are in their kind of IT modernization cycle? Are enterprises 20% there, 40% there 60%? Where would you put them as far as a cycle in terms of where they are in their upgrades and modernization efforts?\nKeith Taylor: Yeah. I mean, it's obviously really hard to pinpoint that with any precision. But what I would say is, I do think it's still relatively early in terms of people whether they want to use a baseball analogy or whatever. I think it's early innings. We haven't past the midpoint here. And so I think there's a long way to go in terms of people who still have a lot of legacy IT architecture, that they're looking to adapt to that sort of hybrid multi-cloud world. And then the other comment I would make is that the pace of change itself is just continuing to accelerate. And so, I think that the technology life cycles and refresh cycles are shortening. I think people are thinking differently about how that idea, as I said, in my comments, a number of very large technology markets are dislocating as they shift to as a service. And as we talked about at Analyst Day, that provides an upside opportunity for us to get a bit more wallet share, as those things are delivered as a service with Equinix as a point of nexus for consuming those services. Because we're getting both the underlying service providers themselves locating infrastructure at Equinix. And then we're often able to deliver those services on the platform aligned with things like fabric and metal and other things that are allowing us more wallet share. And so I think it's still early days. I think there is a long period of IT architecture and digital transformation investment in front of us for the foreseeable future.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimon Flannery: Great, thank you very much. Good evening. Just on the normalization point again. Can you just talk about the supply chain side of things? And are there any challenges that you see both in terms of availability, basically as you get into more of the infrastructure businesses and then just inflation which some of the others in the food chain have been talking about with freight costs, et cetera? And you mentioned some of the challenges with COVID and some of the Asian markets like Singapore. I think we've also heard more stories about limitations on power and water and some municipalities kind of looking at datacenters in a slightly different lens. You obviously highlighted your ESG initiatives, but any color around you see that evolving and how the Equinix is positioned for that would be great?\nKeith Taylor: Thanks. Thanks for the question. I'll take the one around supply chain. Suffice it to say, we've been investing quite heavily. You've heard us speak about in our procurement and strategic sourcing initiatives under a very strong leadership. And as a result, we are getting ahead of some of the perceived constraints in the marketplace. And we're just normally managing our access into the production cycles for this year, but it's also contemplating our consumption needs for next year, that marries up nicely with also the inflationary exposure that one might otherwise have, by entering into broader commitments, you can mitigate some of that inflationary pressure as well. But that all said, I think we're making some great for having great successes and working with our partners or vendors and our suppliers. And then I would also go on to say that inherent in our contracts is a lot of inflationary protection. So there's the aspect of supply and demand and then there's the aspect of pricing. And again, we're very confident that our contracts will appropriately contemplate the exposure to the extent that you brought up your higher inflationary environment over the coming years. And so from both perspectives, we want to speed up and in both to make sure that we protect our industries and revenue, but we also have access to deliver the management support the cost model. I think we're doing a good job of that as a company. Charles, do you want to talk about the Singapore?\nCharles Meyers: Yeah, a little bit there in terms of - I think the question of - specifically as it relates to Singapore. I think there was a COVID related delay in terms of the timing of that facility, that created a little bit of revenue headwind, relative to the timing. Because demand for that is so strong for us, that we had planned on that coming online a little bit earlier. And so we're seeing a little bit less, despite that delivered a really strong quarter. And I do think there is a broader phenomenon, as you described in terms of markets thinking about how they're going to allocate capacity and deal with the demand for datacenters and the environmental impacts. What I would say is that, that's exactly why we're making the level of commitment into ESG and in particular, the environmental side that we are. I think, we're really positioned to tell a story there as now the leader going out and saying, we're going to be Climate Neutral by 2030. And then we're going to be in a position to really partner with municipalities to say, hey look, there's a tonne of economic and social benefit being driven by digital. I talked about that in the Analyst Day, to the tune of $100 trillion. And people want to tap into that, but they want to do so responsibly. And I think our ability to make the investments in ESG is going to continue to be something that really differentiates us. And that's not true only in Asia by any means. There's a number of markets around the world facing those same things. And honestly, I think that's going to be the thing one of the areas where we continue to separate ourselves from packs. One of the added piece of color on the prior question to on the supply chain sort of constraints issues. Now, as I've talked to some people about it. There's really kind of three areas in our business where you think about it. The data centers build side of things. There --because of our size, our market leadership et cetera, I think we feel like we're in a very good position to gain access to the equipment, we need to continue to hit our delivery dates. And so feeling in a good position there, but obviously, continuing to monitor trends. And on the networking side of our business where maybe we're a little less positioned, but what we've done is really said, okay, we're going to go ahead and make investments to mitigate risks there. And in fact, that's an area where we've had real success. And again, that showed up a bit in the quarter and in our guide, as we think about pulling some costs in. And then as the third level of is really at the digital infrastructure services line with things like metal. And that's an area where it's a smaller business for us. And so, it will be less impactful, but we are looking there about how we can partner with a number of folks to mitigate supply chain impacts there, especially since we had just come off a very strong bookings quarter for metal. And so we want to make sure that we can continue to sustain that momentum.\nSimon Flannery: Good color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Your line is open\nBrendan Lynch: Great, thanks for taking my question. You recently put out a press release related to the channel. And it was clearly another strong quarter for the channel in 2Q. Maybe you could talk a little bit about your changing approach there and what type of investment you might need to make to bring the new structure to fruition?\nKeith Taylor: Yeah, it really incredibly strong performance from the channel. And it's been that way for every quarter for. As far as I can remember, we've just been really delivering well in that arena. I would say that there's a few things. One, the relationship that we have, with what we refer to as our alliance partner group, you mentioned several of them in the script, again, the usual suspects, AWS, Microsoft, Oracle, et cetera. Those are posts that we are partnering with as enterprises think through their demand for hybrid infrastructure. They are wanting to advance sales cycles for their public cloud services. And in order to do so they have to have a comprehensive answer for the customer in terms of the hybrid infrastructure story. And so together, that's very much a one in one equals three kind of story. And we can bring that to the customer, and have really been effective in winning business together. And so we're seeing real strength there. On the retailer side, people that are combining value in certain ways with Equinix value to solve customer problems, we're seeing a nice uptick there. And what I would say is, we're seeing more concentration in terms of a smaller number of our really well - highly capable retailers delivering more of the revenue. And I think that's a good general dynamic for us. And in terms of the investments we're making, the big area there is really to continue to upgrade our processes and systems. To be very honest, we're not designed channel ready from the beginning and continue to adapt those to be more channel-friendly. So that, quoting, ordering, customer support can all be done in ways that support a customer of customer or a customer by channel partner in this case. And so the adaptation of our systems is - that's a multiyear sort of trajectory. But that really is some of the key areas that we're making investments to really better serve channel partners.\nBrendan Lynch: Great, just one follow up on that. I believe you have a goal of getting to about 50% from channel sales. What is the timeframe for that? And also, what effect on margins will be increased channel sales have?\nKeith Taylor: Yeah, I see people have asked me that question. And I've answered that. So I think you're probably referring to statements I made in the past of that I see no reason why we couldn't be 50%. I don't know exactly when that will occur. I do think that success with our - as we're seeing channel partners embrace some of our newer services like metal and network edge. Network edge is almost inherently sort of a channel or service, because we're partnering both with people that are providing their virtualized network functions, and then with providers who are bringing that to market in tandem with other value. I think we're seeing a bias towards continued strength in the channel. But we also have a continued great success with our direct selling team, and so both are growing nicely. So I don't know, our channels been over indexing a bit. And so I think we will trend towards higher numbers. But it's hard to predict, I think exactly where we land. I think if the newer services really accelerate, I think that could bring us the higher channel percentages faster. And in terms of impact on margins, they're really not particularly meaningful in terms of - our current model is slightly higher cost in that we often are double copying on commissions, when we have our direct team partnering with channels. But when you look at the customer lifetime value of these contracts, the implication of that to margins is actually quite small. And, given there is very attractive profile, in terms of return on capital and margin of some of these newer services, I don't feel like that's going to be a significant drag on margins. In fact, I think our other areas of margin expansion are going to overpower those.\nBrendan Lynch: Great, thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAri Klein: Thanks. And just maybe in the Americas, the cabinet additions have picked up which I think you've been alluding to over the last couple of quarters in the backlog. And now you mentioned that at least overall, committed backlog exceeded the build backlog. So how should we think about utilization rates I guess moving forward, it's around 73% now? A little bit lower than it's been historically. What kind of rate would you like to get to?\nKeith Taylor: I'll take that one. Clearly, you're right, the, we had a really good quarter something that we foreshadow for the last two quarters, particularly around the West Coast of the U.S. And so great success in particular with the cable landing station. That I'll say we've introduced some new capacity or the Silicon Valley 11 asset has come online. And so when you look at the overall utilization rate, it's still in the mid to low-70s. That said, we're going to continue to have success in the Americas. Charles alluded to and I've mentioned that. And so I would assume that utilization level is going to continue to move up as we consume the inventory of the assets were built. I'd also add just on that basis, I made the comment in my prepared remarks. The amount of booked but yet to be built inventory is up slightly, despite all of the inventory that we've got all of the inventory that moved into the billing queues. And so that's a real positive. So it gives you a sense that there has been substantial bookings already that will consume that inventory. The other thing I think is really worthy of note is quarter and for that matter, through the rest of the year. We anticipate it will continue to be selling into what was historically known as horizon assets. We've seen a real nice move up in as we said, six of the seven markets plus some of the smaller markets in the U.S. And that includes much of the capacity related to the formerly known as Verizon assets. So we're excited about the momentum. I think you're going to see the Americas region continue to perform well. As we said, last quarter and we're going to tell you this quarter through the rest of the year, and we'll update you on '22 when we get there. But overall, we're just delighted by the success we've seen on the heels of all this opportunity.\nAri Klein: Thanks. Maybe just a follow up on the America's, AMR per cabinet came down slightly in the quarter. Was that just timing, given the cabinet additions?\nKeith Taylor: It is timing. And again, it goes back to large, as I referred to a large cable landing station deployment, it came at a different price point. And so you've got the timing impact, as well as a very large deployment on the West Coast. But overall, from a pricing perspective, we have seen great success. Charles alluded to it in his prepared remarks, just the number of deals that we're doing across a number of customers, the volume of activity and mainly small to medium sized deals with high focus on pricing on the pricing environment is playing out perfectly for the company. And as a result, despite timing, there's really nothing that is abnormal as it relates to our pricing environment.\nCharles Meyers: Yeah, I think that's just a better area where the healthy pricing and the business mix that is being reflected in the - across the board. It's just continue to be really strong, and we're hitting that sweet spot in the market, pricing is firm, and then interconnection activity is high. And all that comes together into a really an awesome story relative to yields. And so it's been years now, because people are always saying, can they - can the Americans get better. And here's a guy I was always like, okay, that's pretty darn good and yet it continues to rise. So it's been - it's really been a good story.\nAri Klein: Great, thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. And good afternoon. Just a couple of follow ups. So first, there was a mention that the cabinet backlog increased in the quarter. And I was curious if that's relative to the 11,000, that was disclosed at the Analyst meeting in June, and how that might compare to historical levels of backlog? And then secondly, the gross new global customers added in the quarter increased to 270. And curious if you could unpack how the increase in this metric could influence your future results and where this increase may be coming from.\nCharles Meyers: If I take the backlog question, I'll take.\nKeith Taylor: So on the backlog Mike, we did disclose 1000. Over the last three quarters, we have seen an increase to this level. I'll refer to this as an elevated level of backlog. So it did increase slightly over the prior quarter. And as a result - again, it's a reflection of the momentum in the business, also, to some degree, the tightening of our booking activity very, very strong June. And because of the strong June, of course, that goes into booked but yet to be build. But overall, into momentum that we're seeing not only in the activity of the booking activity, what it means for the backlog, but even more importantly, the depth and scale of our pipeline as we look forward. And that's really about revenue. In all three cases, that seems to be enough up into the right movement.\nCharles Meyers: On the new customers, I'd say we continue to feel really good about our new logo capture capabilities both direct and via channel. And interestingly via channel isn't necessarily showing up in customer account. Because oftentimes, those are the customer record is the channel partner. And so it's actually there's even more strength than sort of appear on the face of the results overall. And in terms of where they're coming from, I think we're having pretty uniform success geographically. So there's no one region that is significantly outpacing the others. Obviously, we have really strong quarter for the Americas. And that selling team, I think, has been doing an exceptional job. But we're also seeing good new logo capture across the other regions as well. And in terms of how it translates into business, you do see that new logos over index on a growth rate perspective from vis-\u00e0-vis existing customers. And so I think they have the opportunity to as we can continue to do that. That's really why when we talk about this three-legged strategy of scale, expand, innovate. Scale is with the customers are buying. And so let's continue to get new customers and add capacity in existing markets to serve them. Then expanding in terms of new geographies to increase wallet share. And then the innovation side, which is really bringing in new services and the ability to capture more wallet over time in terms of the service types. And so I think it gives us a really a multi-dimensional growth opportunity that's really showing up. So new customer, definitely, look we still get the bulk of our bookings from existing customers. And that sort of always good news and that our customers are expanding. There's less friction and that. There's lower cost to acquire. Customer lifetime value is continuing to go up. But new customers are definitely the lifeblood for the business as well. And so we're having focus there and real success there. But it's fairly uniform both across geos and across our products.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Colby Synesael with Cowen. Your line is open.\nColby Synesael: Great. Two modelling questions, if I may. One in the AFFO calculation, there was an adjustment for impairment charges of $33.6 million, and just curious what that is? And then secondly, you've done just over, I think 40% margin in the first half. You're getting to just over 47% for the year. So obviously an implied downtick in the back half. Where are we most likely going to see that as at COGS, sales and marketing or is it G&A? Thanks.\nKeith Taylor: So let me just take the impairment charge first. And Charles and I will respond to the other one. There were some federal tax adjustments associated with the causing of some matters in the quarter. And as a result, because to the tax - and you have to keep pure. And you'll see that there's basically a substantial decrease in tax. It was primarily in relation to a transaction we did in Australia, vis-\u00e0-vis Metronode where we're indemnified by the other party. And as a result, you've got the benefit on the tax line, that you impaired your assets on the other way. And so net-net, it has no meaningful impact on the P&L, but it gets disclosed separately and it's grossed up. And so itself shows itself independent in the other income and expense line. So that's what happened there? But again, as it relates to AFFO there is no meaningful move, because it was embedded in the other lines. Then as it relates to the margin question. Yes, we've done very well in the first two quarters of the year. As we continue to say, we want to guide you to what we think will happen for the year, no surprise. And although for the year, we're saying greater than 47%. We are making a relatively meaningful investment. Q2, we added net roughly 250 heads to the organization, Q3 and Q4, we're going to add another 700-800 heads to the organization. And as a result, you're observing the human capital that we're - that we need to invest in our growth. And so that's one aspect of it. Two you've got the seasonal impact of utilities in the Americas that's coming through. And then three, because Q1 and Q2, we've had the benefit of a number of non-recurring revenue items that don't carry a lot of cross with them. So the JV fees when we sell an asset, and we get a sales fee, or we get a development fee. As you know and as you can see in our results, it comes through the revenue line, but there's very low drag to the bottom line. And so it can be inherently lumpy. And we just don't see a lot of that through the second half of the year. If anything, as I mentioned, non-recurring revenue will go down Q3 over Q2, but then it's going to flatline in Q4, and there will be another one-off fee that likely gets recorded in the fourth quarter. The bottom line -\nColby Synesael: But even with that fee that you just mentioned, you think that NRR is flat in 4Q versus the 3Q number?\nKeith Taylor: Yeah, it is. That's correct.\nColby Synesael: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nTim Horan: Thank you. We've seen some pretty transformational outsourcing by the carriers, the hyperscalars. Do you guys think it will be an important partner there? And will that just also attract your new enterprise customers fewer locations? Thanks.\nCharles Meyers: If I understand that, you're asking if the carriers themselves will be attractive partners for us to attract enterprise customers.\nTim Horan: Well, AT&T is outsourcing their core network to Azure. And we've seen this announce something, but AWS. Do you think, will you be an important part about outsourcing, helping to hyperscalars and AT&T and other carriers are looking to do the same thing globally?\nCharles Meyers: Yeah, I think so. I think that we definitely have an opportunity there. I think that overall supply chain is definitely showing sort of signs of reshaping a bit. But as you know, carriers are really important set of partners for us as it is. In fact, it's our enterprise success, it's actually more than what is reflected in some of our results that we report to you in this earnings deck for example. Because some of the revenues on the enterprise - on the network side are really carrier selling enterprises. And I think when you have this dynamic of carriers, working with other providers that are, that are really taking a different and more non-traditional approach to building their infrastructure. And Dish is a great example there. I think we have absolutely had an opportunity to continue to play. And our points of interconnection and really act as key points of nexus in in some of these architectures, that I think are going to be important pieces of the puzzle. So yes, absolutely. In fact, our business development team is really quite active in really thinking through edge opportunities and some of these more emerging infrastructure areas where people making new significant investments, unlike what you're seeing from Dish.\nTim Horan: And just a follow up to that, do you think qualitatively the hyperscalars are more likely to outsource infrastructure or the insourcing more? What do you think the trend is heading there?\nCharles Meyers: As we do see some a greater level of appetite from some of the hyperscalars to self-provision. But I think that the demand is just so robust, that there's going to continue to be a huge amount of that, that is going to need to come from third-parties. And so - and as we've already said, our xScale aspirations aren't to sort of go, capture share in in huge buckets. That is really to grow that business by targeting attract have been strategically important locations and deployments that we think play to the overall benefit of Equinix and deliver outstanding returns to the JV and for our JV partner. And I think we're really executing very well on that strategy. So I think there's plenty of opportunity out there. But there is some, I think some of the hyperscalars are seeing desire to self-provision in certain markets.\nTim Horan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our last question will come from Jon Atkin with RBC. Your line is open.\nJon Atkin: Thanks very much. So a question on hyperscale, Slide 20 xScale looks like you did 37 megawatts of leasing, you've got 140 megawatts of capacity. And if I'm interpreting the lower right numbers correctly, 31 megawatts available to sell? So I guess my question is, what's the type of wage that we should expect annually quarterly in terms of at least a number? And at what rate to that 140 grow kind of on a quarterly one-rates?\nKeith Taylor: Yeah. I would say one of the comments we made was, we have seen a lot of success. And Charles made the comment previously, virtually everything was built was now sold out. And so we're going to continue to ramp up dramatically. One of the things that is critically important in the xScale initiative is for plan. And quite openly, we've had more momentum in the business than we originally anticipated. So the teams are working exceedingly hard to procure - secure future inventory. And it's probably a little bit early to tell you exactly how that will present itself. But suffice it to say, we'll continue to provide a really detailed and detailed summary of all the different builds that are going on across the three regions of the world. And again, we anticipate that xScale will be in all three regions of the world now. And as we said, with the GIC initiative, about $7 billion of capital over 32 buildings and 600 megawatts, that is through time period in 2025 will take us to 2025 and beyond. But that doesn't take into consideration some of the other initiatives that we're working on, including another joint venture with a different party. And so as we continue to progress, we'll just update you and the rest of the community. But we are seeing great success, if I can summaries this. So that diversity, everything that we have built and we're continuing to procure and secure more land and capacity to build up for the future.\nCharles Meyers: Yes, it's not 00 certainly not precise. I realized, but I can tell you that the next 140 to come a lot faster than the first 100 employees. And because, we're definitely accelerating putting capital to work and seeing, seeing the success.\nJon Atkin: Great. And then lastly, the balance sheet is showing $227 million in assets held for sale. Can you remind us what is it you're selling?\nKeith Taylor: Those assets typically, so Dublin was the first example of that. Our Dublin 5 asset moved to the joint venture on July 7. And so that's an asset that is available for sale. We have some other assets. Again we're investing the capital on our balance sheet, and then we're going to transition or contribute it to the joint ventures and move and thereby get a recovery of those investments that have equity or ownership. So those are just the assets that are sort of queuing up to be delivered to the joint ventures.\nJon Atkin: Thank you.\nKatrina Rymill: Great. That concludes our Q2 call. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Keith Taylor",
            "content": "Thanks, Charles. And good afternoon to everyone. I hope you and your families are well and enjoying summer months. So let me start by saying it was great to spend time with many of you albeit virtually, at our June Analyst Day state. No surprise, we were eager to share our plans on how we intend to scale, extend and innovate the business over the coming years to drive long-term shareholder value, meaning more revenues, higher margins and more cash flows. With respect to the quarter the business continues to perform exceedingly well. At the macro environment, digital infrastructure continues to drive favorable demand. In fact, we exceeded our expectations. There are many highlights to share with you from the quarter. To start, we had record bookings activity at both the company and the American regional level. We enjoyed robust channel activity along with planned shared. Interconnection additions were solid with physically and virtually. And our digital infrastructure service lines which include edge and metal are gaining momentum. Simply put, we're continuing to execute against the goals highlighted at the Analysts Day. Given our performance, we're raising our guidance across each of revenues, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share for the year. Now let me cover the results for the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalizing constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q2 revenues were $1.658 billion up 8% over the same quarter last year, due to strong business performance across our platform led by the Americas region. And as expected non-recurring revenues increased quarter over quarter to 7% of revenues due to a meaningful step up an xScale joint venture fees in APAC and EMEA and custom installation work across all three regions. As you can appreciate, non-recurring revenues are inherently lumpy. And therefore, as a result, we expect the Q3 non-recurring revenues to decrease by $8 million compared to Q2. Our backlog of books, but yet to be built cabinets have increased slightly, despite the 4200 increase in building cabinets in the quarter. Q2 revenues, net of our FX searches included an $11 million benefits compared to our prior guidance rates. Total Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $797 million or 48% of revenues, up 7% over the same quarter last year, meaningfully outperforming our expectations due to strong operating performance and timing of spend. Q2 included a planned rebound of repairs and maintenance spending and higher utility costs relative to Q1. Q2 adjusted EBITDA net of our FX hedges includes a $6 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates and $4 million of integration costs. Total Q2 FFO was $632 million, including a $25 million recurring CapEx increase compared to the prior quarter above our expectations due to strong operating performance and more integration costs. Turning to our regional highlights, with full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC has the highest year-over-year revenue growth of 11% followed by the Americas and EEMA region both at 8%. EMEA revenue growth rate reflects the lapping of the significant interconnection price increases and other one-off positive adjustments from last year. We expect the EMEA growth rates return to normalize levels in Q4. The Americas region saw continued strength of our second consecutive quarter of record bookings at six of our seven largest markets improved over the prior year. Also, we're enjoying health, healthy booking activity across our smaller markets to including Atlanta, Austin, Denver and Seattle. Deals were focused on retail interconnected deployments with healthy pricing. And the Americas region also benefited from strong imports from the other two regions a reflection of our continued focus on platform sell. Our EMEA region have a strong quarter led by Dublin and Stockholm and our newly opened Bordeaux market, as well as high exports to the other two regions. Enterprises contributed approximately one third of the region's bookings, up significantly over the prior year. We're also seeing good momentum across our flat markets. And the EMEA region benefited from non-recurring revenues related to xScale fees earned from the prelease of our entire Frankfurt 9 and London 11 buildings, 37 megawatts of demand. And finally, the Asia-Pacific region had a solid quarter led by Singapore and Japan with strong regional bookings. Pricing for small and medium sized deals remain strong and we're seeing good traction with Equinix metal. APAC regions quarterly AMR growth was partially constrained due to COVID-related capacity delays in Singapore, a political uncertainty in our Hong Kong markets. And now looking at capital structure, please refer to Slide 8 and 9. We ended the quarter with cash of about $1.8 billion and our net debt leverage ratio is 3.8 times of Q2 annualized EBITDA, highlighting the financial flexibility and strategic advantage we have relative to anyone else in our space. In May we raised $2.6 billion, including in an incremental $1 billion in green notes. Biz Equinix is an overall investment grade issuance in late-2019, we've reduced our annualized interest expense by approximately $196 million, offset in part by the incremental debt capital raised. Our blended cost growth is now the lowest in the industry at approximately 1.7% and our weighted average maturity is nearly 10 years. We also raised $100 million of ATM equity in the quarter. We continue to expect to use both debt and equity to fund our future business needs with an increased lean towards debt capital. Turning to Slide 10 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $692 million, including recurring CapEx of $45 billion. We opened three new retail projects this quarter, including new IBXs in Bordeaux and Silicon Valley. We also purchased land for development in Frankfurt and Helsinki. Revenues from owned assets now represents 58% of our total revenue through the acquisition of our Singapore 3 IBX. On the xScale side of the business, after quarter end, we contributed a Dublin 5 asset to the EMEA joint venture and in return for net proceeds after our 20% equity contribution of $49 million. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 11. Our 153 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 86% utilized and generate a 27% cash on cash return on the gross PPE invested. Looking forward, we expect to exit the year closer to the top-end over our stabilized asset growth rate in part due to strong America's revenue growth. Please refer to Slides 12 through 16 for updated summary of 2021 guidance and bridges. Do note our 2021 guidance does not include any financial results related to the pending GPX India acquisition, which is expected to close in Q3. For the full year 2021, we're raising our revenue guidance by $50 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance by $27 million, primarily due to strong operating performance and favorable FX rates. Although slightly offset due to the timing of standards, we proactively pull forward expenditures to mitigate supply chain risks. This guidance implies a normalizing constant currency revenue growth rate of approximately 8% and midpoint compared to the prior year, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of greater than 47%. And given the operating momentum in the business, we're raising our 2021 AFFO guidance by $15 million going 10% to 12% on a normalizing constant currency basis, compared to the previous year, while also increasing our AFFO per share range. 2021 CapEx is now expected to range between $2.7 billion and $3 billion including an approximate $450 million of on balance sheet, xScale CapEx. A significant portion of which is expected to be reimbursed by either the current or future JVs and $193 million of recurring CapEx spend, a slight increase over the prior quarter due to timing of spend as we mitigate supply chain risks. So let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles. Okay, great. Thank you for the questions. Let me take the first one, let me take the first question. First and foremost, when we came up at the Analyst Day, one of the questions we spent a lot of energy talking about was the AFFO per share growth rate in 2022 relative to the broader guide. The reason I said it was going to be in the bottom half of the range instead of the top half of the range was, one that was a reflection of all the investments we're making across our portfolio this year. Not only as it relates to xScale, but also our digital infrastructure services and then all the efficiency initiatives. So we were absorbing the full annualized impact of those costs in in 2022. As a result, it tends to cause us to be a little bit more dilutive on the per share metric relative to the broader guide. In addition, of course, we've got a very strong guide for this year as well. So we've had the benefit of refinancing out of the majority of our high yield debt. And so you've got a little bit of wind at your back and you won't have that wind to get back next year. So that's the primary reason. Relative to the comments we made about this year and raising our guide, probably not a big surprise to many of you, as we saw a lot of this coming in is reflected in their long-term model. That all said, we saw the ability to move our numbers up. But it's a five-year plan as you can appreciate. And so I wouldn't say that we're changing the trajectory on the guide for Analyst Day, just because we had one good quarter. That doesn't feel like the right thing to do. Secondly, as it relates to ATM. Like anything, we are going to use a little bit of debt and equity. This was really commensurate with our commitment to our rating agencies to tap periodically at ATM facility. But we've dramatically reduced what we anticipate that we would otherwise use. And as a result, you saw $100 million. But the message that I had in the prepared remarks was really the lean is towards debt capital on a go forward basis, for obvious reasons when the cost of bad debt capital and even over the last few weeks has continued to trend downwards. And so that will be a lien on a go forward basis. So there is always going to be a little bit of land. But again, I want to want to make sure that everybody fully appreciates. We want to use the debt capacity that we have on our balance sheet to its fullest advantage, but also at the same time maintaining a very positive relationship with a rating agencies. Sure, David, yeah, we've typically guide three to five. So we're kind of at the bottom lower end of that range this quarter. I think there are some timing effects in there and there's also some onetime items, I think that are flowing through. But as we really unpacked that and looked at what we expected, towards the back half of the year, I think we feel good about as sort of moving more towards the top end. And I think that's partially due to just really, obviously really strong continued momentum in the Americas business and out of the full portfolio of assets there. So, 8% percent quarter there, obviously some strong NRR in there. But even on the NRR side, 6% growth really strong quarter. And so I think towards the back half of the year, we're feeling really good about the trajectory there on the stabilized assets same store number. Yeah, I mean, that's where our focus is. I believe the 51 and putting the energy in there and continuing to build that ecosystem, which we believe has the critical mass of interconnection and ecosystem depth that is really necessary to scale our market effectively. So yeah, we're seeing good success there and again, the emphasis is on that Peachtree location in Q1. Yeah. I mean, it's obviously really hard to pinpoint that with any precision. But what I would say is, I do think it's still relatively early in terms of people whether they want to use a baseball analogy or whatever. I think it's early innings. We haven't past the midpoint here. And so I think there's a long way to go in terms of people who still have a lot of legacy IT architecture, that they're looking to adapt to that sort of hybrid multi-cloud world. And then the other comment I would make is that the pace of change itself is just continuing to accelerate. And so, I think that the technology life cycles and refresh cycles are shortening. I think people are thinking differently about how that idea, as I said, in my comments, a number of very large technology markets are dislocating as they shift to as a service. And as we talked about at Analyst Day, that provides an upside opportunity for us to get a bit more wallet share, as those things are delivered as a service with Equinix as a point of nexus for consuming those services. Because we're getting both the underlying service providers themselves locating infrastructure at Equinix. And then we're often able to deliver those services on the platform aligned with things like fabric and metal and other things that are allowing us more wallet share. And so I think it's still early days. I think there is a long period of IT architecture and digital transformation investment in front of us for the foreseeable future. Thanks. Thanks for the question. I'll take the one around supply chain. Suffice it to say, we've been investing quite heavily. You've heard us speak about in our procurement and strategic sourcing initiatives under a very strong leadership. And as a result, we are getting ahead of some of the perceived constraints in the marketplace. And we're just normally managing our access into the production cycles for this year, but it's also contemplating our consumption needs for next year, that marries up nicely with also the inflationary exposure that one might otherwise have, by entering into broader commitments, you can mitigate some of that inflationary pressure as well. But that all said, I think we're making some great for having great successes and working with our partners or vendors and our suppliers. And then I would also go on to say that inherent in our contracts is a lot of inflationary protection. So there's the aspect of supply and demand and then there's the aspect of pricing. And again, we're very confident that our contracts will appropriately contemplate the exposure to the extent that you brought up your higher inflationary environment over the coming years. And so from both perspectives, we want to speed up and in both to make sure that we protect our industries and revenue, but we also have access to deliver the management support the cost model. I think we're doing a good job of that as a company. Charles, do you want to talk about the Singapore? Yeah, it really incredibly strong performance from the channel. And it's been that way for every quarter for. As far as I can remember, we've just been really delivering well in that arena. I would say that there's a few things. One, the relationship that we have, with what we refer to as our alliance partner group, you mentioned several of them in the script, again, the usual suspects, AWS, Microsoft, Oracle, et cetera. Those are posts that we are partnering with as enterprises think through their demand for hybrid infrastructure. They are wanting to advance sales cycles for their public cloud services. And in order to do so they have to have a comprehensive answer for the customer in terms of the hybrid infrastructure story. And so together, that's very much a one in one equals three kind of story. And we can bring that to the customer, and have really been effective in winning business together. And so we're seeing real strength there. On the retailer side, people that are combining value in certain ways with Equinix value to solve customer problems, we're seeing a nice uptick there. And what I would say is, we're seeing more concentration in terms of a smaller number of our really well - highly capable retailers delivering more of the revenue. And I think that's a good general dynamic for us. And in terms of the investments we're making, the big area there is really to continue to upgrade our processes and systems. To be very honest, we're not designed channel ready from the beginning and continue to adapt those to be more channel-friendly. So that, quoting, ordering, customer support can all be done in ways that support a customer of customer or a customer by channel partner in this case. And so the adaptation of our systems is - that's a multiyear sort of trajectory. But that really is some of the key areas that we're making investments to really better serve channel partners. Yeah, I see people have asked me that question. And I've answered that. So I think you're probably referring to statements I made in the past of that I see no reason why we couldn't be 50%. I don't know exactly when that will occur. I do think that success with our - as we're seeing channel partners embrace some of our newer services like metal and network edge. Network edge is almost inherently sort of a channel or service, because we're partnering both with people that are providing their virtualized network functions, and then with providers who are bringing that to market in tandem with other value. I think we're seeing a bias towards continued strength in the channel. But we also have a continued great success with our direct selling team, and so both are growing nicely. So I don't know, our channels been over indexing a bit. And so I think we will trend towards higher numbers. But it's hard to predict, I think exactly where we land. I think if the newer services really accelerate, I think that could bring us the higher channel percentages faster. And in terms of impact on margins, they're really not particularly meaningful in terms of - our current model is slightly higher cost in that we often are double copying on commissions, when we have our direct team partnering with channels. But when you look at the customer lifetime value of these contracts, the implication of that to margins is actually quite small. And, given there is very attractive profile, in terms of return on capital and margin of some of these newer services, I don't feel like that's going to be a significant drag on margins. In fact, I think our other areas of margin expansion are going to overpower those. I'll take that one. Clearly, you're right, the, we had a really good quarter something that we foreshadow for the last two quarters, particularly around the West Coast of the U.S. And so great success in particular with the cable landing station. That I'll say we've introduced some new capacity or the Silicon Valley 11 asset has come online. And so when you look at the overall utilization rate, it's still in the mid to low-70s. That said, we're going to continue to have success in the Americas. Charles alluded to and I've mentioned that. And so I would assume that utilization level is going to continue to move up as we consume the inventory of the assets were built. I'd also add just on that basis, I made the comment in my prepared remarks. The amount of booked but yet to be built inventory is up slightly, despite all of the inventory that we've got all of the inventory that moved into the billing queues. And so that's a real positive. So it gives you a sense that there has been substantial bookings already that will consume that inventory. The other thing I think is really worthy of note is quarter and for that matter, through the rest of the year. We anticipate it will continue to be selling into what was historically known as horizon assets. We've seen a real nice move up in as we said, six of the seven markets plus some of the smaller markets in the U.S. And that includes much of the capacity related to the formerly known as Verizon assets. So we're excited about the momentum. I think you're going to see the Americas region continue to perform well. As we said, last quarter and we're going to tell you this quarter through the rest of the year, and we'll update you on '22 when we get there. But overall, we're just delighted by the success we've seen on the heels of all this opportunity. It is timing. And again, it goes back to large, as I referred to a large cable landing station deployment, it came at a different price point. And so you've got the timing impact, as well as a very large deployment on the West Coast. But overall, from a pricing perspective, we have seen great success. Charles alluded to it in his prepared remarks, just the number of deals that we're doing across a number of customers, the volume of activity and mainly small to medium sized deals with high focus on pricing on the pricing environment is playing out perfectly for the company. And as a result, despite timing, there's really nothing that is abnormal as it relates to our pricing environment. So on the backlog Mike, we did disclose 1000. Over the last three quarters, we have seen an increase to this level. I'll refer to this as an elevated level of backlog. So it did increase slightly over the prior quarter. And as a result - again, it's a reflection of the momentum in the business, also, to some degree, the tightening of our booking activity very, very strong June. And because of the strong June, of course, that goes into booked but yet to be build. But overall, into momentum that we're seeing not only in the activity of the booking activity, what it means for the backlog, but even more importantly, the depth and scale of our pipeline as we look forward. And that's really about revenue. In all three cases, that seems to be enough up into the right movement. So let me just take the impairment charge first. And Charles and I will respond to the other one. There were some federal tax adjustments associated with the causing of some matters in the quarter. And as a result, because to the tax - and you have to keep pure. And you'll see that there's basically a substantial decrease in tax. It was primarily in relation to a transaction we did in Australia, vis-a\u0300-vis Metronode where we're indemnified by the other party. And as a result, you've got the benefit on the tax line, that you impaired your assets on the other way. And so net-net, it has no meaningful impact on the P&L, but it gets disclosed separately and it's grossed up. And so itself shows itself independent in the other income and expense line. So that's what happened there? But again, as it relates to AFFO there is no meaningful move, because it was embedded in the other lines. Then as it relates to the margin question. Yes, we've done very well in the first two quarters of the year. As we continue to say, we want to guide you to what we think will happen for the year, no surprise. And although for the year, we're saying greater than 47%. We are making a relatively meaningful investment. Q2, we added net roughly 250 heads to the organization, Q3 and Q4, we're going to add another 700-800 heads to the organization. And as a result, you're observing the human capital that we're - that we need to invest in our growth. And so that's one aspect of it. Two you've got the seasonal impact of utilities in the Americas that's coming through. And then three, because Q1 and Q2, we've had the benefit of a number of non-recurring revenue items that don't carry a lot of cross with them. So the JV fees when we sell an asset, and we get a sales fee, or we get a development fee. As you know and as you can see in our results, it comes through the revenue line, but there's very low drag to the bottom line. And so it can be inherently lumpy. And we just don't see a lot of that through the second half of the year. If anything, as I mentioned, non-recurring revenue will go down Q3 over Q2, but then it's going to flatline in Q4, and there will be another one-off fee that likely gets recorded in the fourth quarter. The bottom line - Yeah, it is. That's correct. Yeah. I would say one of the comments we made was, we have seen a lot of success. And Charles made the comment previously, virtually everything was built was now sold out. And so we're going to continue to ramp up dramatically. One of the things that is critically important in the xScale initiative is for plan. And quite openly, we've had more momentum in the business than we originally anticipated. So the teams are working exceedingly hard to procure - secure future inventory. And it's probably a little bit early to tell you exactly how that will present itself. But suffice it to say, we'll continue to provide a really detailed and detailed summary of all the different builds that are going on across the three regions of the world. And again, we anticipate that xScale will be in all three regions of the world now. And as we said, with the GIC initiative, about $7 billion of capital over 32 buildings and 600 megawatts, that is through time period in 2025 will take us to 2025 and beyond. But that doesn't take into consideration some of the other initiatives that we're working on, including another joint venture with a different party. And so as we continue to progress, we'll just update you and the rest of the community. But we are seeing great success, if I can summaries this. So that diversity, everything that we have built and we're continuing to procure and secure more land and capacity to build up for the future. Those assets typically, so Dublin was the first example of that. Our Dublin 5 asset moved to the joint venture on July 7. And so that's an asset that is available for sale. We have some other assets. Again we're investing the capital on our balance sheet, and then we're going to transition or contribute it to the joint ventures and move and thereby get a recovery of those investments that have equity or ownership. So those are just the assets that are sort of queuing up to be delivered to the joint ventures."

            "name": "Charles Meyers",
            "content": "Thanks, Kate. Good afternoon, everybody and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As reflected in our results we are seeing significant momentum in our business as digital transformation outpaces previous expectations. Technology span is accelerating and Equinix remains uniquely positioned as traditional technology markets continue to shift as a service consumption models and hybrid multi-cloud is widely adopted as the architecture of choice. The pandemic is highlighted divisional infrastructure is not just a business enabler, but a primary source of competitive advantage for digital leaders across all industries. And we continue to see a multitude of trends driving infrastructure that is more distributed or on demand and more ecosystem connected than ever before, playing to our distinctive strengths. Our results reflect strong performance across our geographies, tremendous momentum in our market leading interconnection franchise and deep customer demand across our expanding portfolio of services. Against this robust demand backdrop, we had a great second quarter, delivering record bookings, fueled by continued momentum in our Americas business and strong quarter of Equinix metal. We processed more than 4600 deals in the quarter across more than 3200 customers, demonstrating both the scale and the consistency of our go-to-market machine. We achieved our 74th consecutive quarter of top-line growth and are pleased to have been recently been included in the Fortune 500, an exciting milestone made possible by the confidence our customers place on Equinix, and by the incredible commitment and passion of our 10,000 plus employees around the world. And we continue to expand our global platform with 35 projects underway across 25 markets in 19 countries, with Q2 openings in Bordeaux, Helsinki in Silicon Valley. Aligned with our values and our purpose, we're also proud to share further enhancements to our old commitments on sustainability, leading in across all elements of ESG. In early June, we became the first in the data center industry to commit to being Climate Neutral by 2030, backed by science-based targets an aggressive green financing plan and a comprehensive sustainability agenda. Aligned with the Paris Climate Agreement, this commitment is a critical step to ensuring Equinix continues to advance investments and innovations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and greening our customers digital supply chains. Additionally, as part of our ongoing focus on diversity, inclusion and belonging and our commitment to wellbeing we recently hosted our second annual WeConnect event, a 24-hour virtual gathering led by our employees, our employee connection networks and our VIV [ph] and wellbeing teams. This event celebrates quality, diversity and connection and offers our employees an opportunity to listen to learn and to engage in courageous conversations as we build a culture and a community, that can have a meaningful sustainable impact on the future of our world. Turning to our results as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q2 were $1.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 7% year-over-year and FFO was again meaningfully ahead of our expectations. Interconnection revenues grew 12% year-over-year, the solid unit ads and healthy pricing. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our global interconnection franchise continues to perform well. We now have over 406,000 total interconnections on our industry leading platform. In Q2, we added an incremental 7800 interconnections and now has 15 macros with more than 10,000 total interconnections. A reflection of the scale digital ecosystems that drive our differentiated value proposition. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 31% year-over-year, and we're seeing IBX diversify as largescale period expands to a broader base of enterprise customers. Equinix Fabric saw excellent growth across all three regions, driven by healthy unit growth and increasing yields as customers expand usage of higher bandwidth connections to interconnect regional and global footprints. More than 2600 customers are now on Fabric, and we continue to see strong attach rates as businesses diversify their end destinations and evolve their connectivity needs in support of highly distributed infrastructure and the adoption of hybrid multi-cloud. Turning to digital infrastructure services, customers are responding very positively as we augment our portfolio to enable physical infrastructure delivered at software speed. We have strong bookings of Equinix metal this quarter, including our largest link today with our channel partner Alarm [ph] for a blockchain company building a network of validation nodes across eight markets. Our network edge offering shows meaningful acceleration, with average deal size increasing nicely as enterprise customers are deploying a diverse set of virtualized network functions from our marketplace of vendors. Importantly, and as expected, digital infrastructure services are also driving strong cross-selling activity and interconnection pull through, with nearly 1000 virtual connections already provisioned to support these deployments. Shifting to our xScale initiative, we continue to expand our plans in light of robust market demand and positive customer feedback. Late in the quarter, we announced agreements for additional joint ventures in the GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund. When closed and fully built out the total investment between Equinix and GIC and our xScale datacenter portfolio will be nearly $7 billion across 32 facilities globally with more than 600 megawatts of power capacity. We currently have 7 xScale builds under development across all three regions, we prelease our entire Frankfurt nine asset in Q2, representing 18 megawatts of capacity fully committed in advance of delivery. With this field, we now have leased more than 100 megawatts of xScale capacity and 100% of our open capacity at lease. We're actively engaged with partners to develop entry plans and other expansion markets globally, including Australia. Now I'll cover highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical delivered strong bookings across all three regions, with particular strength and APAC as traditional carriers continue to invest in specialty telecom firms evolve their portfolios to address demand for cloud, mobile IP services and over the top delivery. New wins and expansions this quarter included [Indiscernible], a local telecom service provider, leveraging interconnection to better serve low latency financial customers. Crosslake Fibre a leading provider of network services deploying in our London for compared to 7 IBXs is to support the first new subsea cable laid across the English Channel in nearly 20 years. And a global telecommunications provider expanding their presence to new locations including Milan and Bordeaux. Our cloud and IT vertical saw continued momentum over indexing in Europe as organizations accelerate hybrid multi-cloud adoption. Expansion this quarter includes Zoom, leading video communications platform, expanding coverage and scale to support market demand. And a cloud delivered enterprise network security provider deploying infrastructure to support offerings in new locations. Our enterprise vertical achieved record bookings, with broad global strength punctuated by an exceptionally strong quarter in the Americas across several sub-segments, including healthcare, consumer services, business and professional services and retail. New wins and expansions including Redbull, a major sports energy drink manufacturer deploying infrastructure across all three regions to take advantage of Equinix's cloud ecosystem. A leading global cosmetics retailer deploying digital infrastructure to optimize their network, move out of legacy data centers and locate private infrastructure adjacent to their cloud providers. And a Fortune 500 Global insurance provider optimizing their infrastructure to support multi-cloud. Content and digital media also achieve solid bookings led by growth and CDN, publishing and digital media and gaming, as digital transformation continued to shape this vertical. Expansions include StackPath, a leading edge computing and services provider deploying infrastructure across multiple edge locations, Ernest Research a leading data analytics company is transforming network topology and interconnect into multiple files across platform Equinix, and i3d.net, a leading provider of application hosting and infrastructure services deployed on platform Equinix to enable a consistent high performance gaming experience globally. And our channel program continues to outperform, delivering a record quarter and accounting for over 35% of bookings. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals, and use cases including multiple Equinix metal and network edge deals. As the channel embraces our digital infrastructure services. We saw continued strength from Alliance partners like AWS, Cisco, Dell, Google, IBM, and Microsoft. And we also had success with key retailers around the world, including a win with HPE, the Rollers Group, a leading Australian retailer to modernize and scale their payments platform, which processes over 30 million transactions per day. So now let me turn the call over to Keith and cover results report. Thanks, Keith. The momentum behind digital transformation is as robust as ever, and shows no signs of letting up. As the world's digital infrastructure company, Equinix plays a unique role in this evolving story and is positioned to be both a catalyst and a key beneficiary as we partner with customers to unlock the enormous promise of digital both economically and socially. As we discussed in our latest Analyst Day, say we are focused on three strategic levers as we execute on this transformational opportunity. First, we will continue to scale, doubling down on the strength of our core business, investing further scale our go-to-market machines to win new customers, putting our capital to work to add capacity in existing markets, and executing on targeted operations whether it's standardized simplified and automate. Driving expanded operating margins and providing a better experience for customers and partners. Second, we will extend the reach of our platform and accelerate our aspirations in xScale. By the end of this year, we'll be in 66 markets around the world and see continued opportunities for expansion and growth across the retail and xScale. And third, we will continue to innovate across our portfolio, scoring scalability, self-service and energy efficiency across our space [ph], delivering advanced features to sustain momentum in our market leading interconnection franchise and driving adoption of our digital infrastructure services to deepen our relevance to customers. Our ability to scale expand and innovate starts with our people. And with our commitment to building a diverse and inclusive workplace for every person, every day, you can confidently say I'm safe, I belong and I matter. We show up every day with an in service to mindset, starting by being in service to each other, which enables us in turn to be in service to our customers, to our communities, and to you, our shareholders. Purpose creates passion. And we are inspired by ours. To be the platform where the world comes together, serving as an enabling force for our customers in unlocking their incredible potential to deliver the innovations that enrich our work, our life and our planet. So let me stop there and open it up for questions. Yeah, I might augment this bit in terms of Jordan in terms of just saying, I think in the environment as attractive as I believe we're operating in now in terms of seeing so much growth opportunity for the business. I think the ability to continue to ensure that we have the ability to respond to that and the balance sheet to do so. It's just something is top of mind for us, as Keith said and the lien is definitely towards debt for the obvious reasons. But I think it probably makes sense for us to I think have some level of ATM, just to continue to have optionality in the business. Yeah. As you indicated here, we were pretty optimistic and bullish about the momentum we were seeing with the enterprise customer, even during the more peak levels of the pandemic et cetera. And so we're seeing people, despite that saying, hey, we've got to be investing in digital. And so it will be showing up in terms of our pipeline build and, in our bookings, and just qualitatively in the conversations, we were having with customers. And so that's why we were kind of signaling that optimism. I think that is definitely translated how we expected it. And I would say that this quarter was even stronger than I think we would have thought it was going to be. And that's as reflected in our results and therefore, in the adaptation and our guide. And so I think the business, just a really strong quarter from enterprise perspective. As I said in the script, across all three regions across a variety of sectors, enterprise bookings, were very strong. [Indiscernible] channels a big part of that working not only in terms of pursuing hybrid cloud opportunities with our key alliance partners, and the cloud players, but also with our retailer portfolio partners. And so, yeah, I think we're seeing it in line or better than we had thought. And I think we expect to continue to see sustained output and growth from the enterprise segment and probably over indexing. Again, cloud and IT and enterprise have been over indexing for a very long time now. An enterprise just seems to be just on a tear in terms of its growth right now. Yeah, a little bit there in terms of - I think the question of - specifically as it relates to Singapore. I think there was a COVID related delay in terms of the timing of that facility, that created a little bit of revenue headwind, relative to the timing. Because demand for that is so strong for us, that we had planned on that coming online a little bit earlier. And so we're seeing a little bit less, despite that delivered a really strong quarter. And I do think there is a broader phenomenon, as you described in terms of markets thinking about how they're going to allocate capacity and deal with the demand for datacenters and the environmental impacts. What I would say is that, that's exactly why we're making the level of commitment into ESG and in particular, the environmental side that we are. I think, we're really positioned to tell a story there as now the leader going out and saying, we're going to be Climate Neutral by 2030. And then we're going to be in a position to really partner with municipalities to say, hey look, there's a tonne of economic and social benefit being driven by digital. I talked about that in the Analyst Day, to the tune of $100 trillion. And people want to tap into that, but they want to do so responsibly. And I think our ability to make the investments in ESG is going to continue to be something that really differentiates us. And that's not true only in Asia by any means. There's a number of markets around the world facing those same things. And honestly, I think that's going to be the thing one of the areas where we continue to separate ourselves from packs. One of the added piece of color on the prior question to on the supply chain sort of constraints issues. Now, as I've talked to some people about it. There's really kind of three areas in our business where you think about it. The data centers build side of things. There --because of our size, our market leadership et cetera, I think we feel like we're in a very good position to gain access to the equipment, we need to continue to hit our delivery dates. And so feeling in a good position there, but obviously, continuing to monitor trends. And on the networking side of our business where maybe we're a little less positioned, but what we've done is really said, okay, we're going to go ahead and make investments to mitigate risks there. And in fact, that's an area where we've had real success. And again, that showed up a bit in the quarter and in our guide, as we think about pulling some costs in. And then as the third level of is really at the digital infrastructure services line with things like metal. And that's an area where it's a smaller business for us. And so, it will be less impactful, but we are looking there about how we can partner with a number of folks to mitigate supply chain impacts there, especially since we had just come off a very strong bookings quarter for metal. And so we want to make sure that we can continue to sustain that momentum. Yeah, I think that's just a better area where the healthy pricing and the business mix that is being reflected in the - across the board. It's just continue to be really strong, and we're hitting that sweet spot in the market, pricing is firm, and then interconnection activity is high. And all that comes together into a really an awesome story relative to yields. And so it's been years now, because people are always saying, can they - can the Americans get better. And here's a guy I was always like, okay, that's pretty darn good and yet it continues to rise. So it's been - it's really been a good story. If I take the backlog question, I'll take. On the new customers, I'd say we continue to feel really good about our new logo capture capabilities both direct and via channel. And interestingly via channel isn't necessarily showing up in customer account. Because oftentimes, those are the customer record is the channel partner. And so it's actually there's even more strength than sort of appear on the face of the results overall. And in terms of where they're coming from, I think we're having pretty uniform success geographically. So there's no one region that is significantly outpacing the others. Obviously, we have really strong quarter for the Americas. And that selling team, I think, has been doing an exceptional job. But we're also seeing good new logo capture across the other regions as well. And in terms of how it translates into business, you do see that new logos over index on a growth rate perspective from vis-a\u0300-vis existing customers. And so I think they have the opportunity to as we can continue to do that. That's really why when we talk about this three-legged strategy of scale, expand, innovate. Scale is with the customers are buying. And so let's continue to get new customers and add capacity in existing markets to serve them. Then expanding in terms of new geographies to increase wallet share. And then the innovation side, which is really bringing in new services and the ability to capture more wallet over time in terms of the service types. And so I think it gives us a really a multi-dimensional growth opportunity that's really showing up. So new customer, definitely, look we still get the bulk of our bookings from existing customers. And that sort of always good news and that our customers are expanding. There's less friction and that. There's lower cost to acquire. Customer lifetime value is continuing to go up. But new customers are definitely the lifeblood for the business as well. And so we're having focus there and real success there. But it's fairly uniform both across geos and across our products. If I understand that, you're asking if the carriers themselves will be attractive partners for us to attract enterprise customers. Yeah, I think so. I think that we definitely have an opportunity there. I think that overall supply chain is definitely showing sort of signs of reshaping a bit. But as you know, carriers are really important set of partners for us as it is. In fact, it's our enterprise success, it's actually more than what is reflected in some of our results that we report to you in this earnings deck for example. Because some of the revenues on the enterprise - on the network side are really carrier selling enterprises. And I think when you have this dynamic of carriers, working with other providers that are, that are really taking a different and more non-traditional approach to building their infrastructure. And Dish is a great example there. I think we have absolutely had an opportunity to continue to play. And our points of interconnection and really act as key points of nexus in in some of these architectures, that I think are going to be important pieces of the puzzle. So yes, absolutely. In fact, our business development team is really quite active in really thinking through edge opportunities and some of these more emerging infrastructure areas where people making new significant investments, unlike what you're seeing from Dish. As we do see some a greater level of appetite from some of the hyperscalars to self-provision. But I think that the demand is just so robust, that there's going to continue to be a huge amount of that, that is going to need to come from third-parties. And so - and as we've already said, our xScale aspirations aren't to sort of go, capture share in in huge buckets. That is really to grow that business by targeting attract have been strategically important locations and deployments that we think play to the overall benefit of Equinix and deliver outstanding returns to the JV and for our JV partner. And I think we're really executing very well on that strategy. So I think there's plenty of opportunity out there. But there is some, I think some of the hyperscalars are seeing desire to self-provision in certain markets. Yes, it's not 00 certainly not precise. I realized, but I can tell you that the next 140 to come a lot faster than the first 100 employees. And because, we're definitely accelerating putting capital to work and seeing, seeing the success."

At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We had a great start to the year delivering one of the strongest net bookings quarters in our history, fueled by strong demand across our platform, our lowest churn quarter in many years, and continued momentum in our Americas business. With the addition of the Bell Canada assets, we are now the market leader in 19 of the 26 countries in which we operate. And we are delighted to now be the market leader in retail colocation across all three regions of the world, taking the number one spot in Asia Pacific for the first time this quarter. Our bookings performance continues to highlight the consistency and scale of our go-to-market engine, executing 4,300 deals with more than 3,200 customers. We have a robust build pipeline to support this demand, including 36 major projects underway across 28 markets in 19 countries, one of our most active build years ever. We fully recognize that COVID remains a very acute issue with continued tragic impacts in key markets around the world, including India and Brazil. Our hearts go out to our colleagues and customers in those markets, and we are actively taking steps to support those communities. But as we navigate toward a post pandemic world, we believe Equinix remains uniquely well positioned. Digital Transformation continues to accelerate, and businesses across a broad range of verticals are recognizing that their infrastructure can be a key source of competitive advantage in an increasingly digital world. Demand is as strong as ever. With global IT spend expected to rebound above pre pandemic levels as enterprises increase hybrid cloud spending, and service providers build out their delivery platforms to tap into this demand. Against this backdrop, we remain focused on the clear set of priorities I outlined at the start of the year, investing in our people and culture, simplifying and scaling our business, accelerating our digital services, and expanding our global reach both through our retail footprint and our rapidly growing xScale business. While we're delighted with our business results, were also highly attuned to our responsibilities as a market leader and continue to advance a bold sustainability agenda across all dimensions of ESG. Supporting our people and strengthening our culture continue to be foundational to our strategy. And in a time where it matters more than ever, our vision remains clear. For Equinix to be a place where every employee every day can confidently say I'm safe. I belong and I matter. And for our workforce at all levels to better reflect and represent the communities in which we operate. In early April, we hosted our second annual days of understanding where 1000s of our employees around the world attended workshops to listen, learn and promote a culture of mutual understanding and inclusion as we continue to build and foster an engaged diverse workforce.  Our people show up every day inspired by our purpose, to be the platform where the world comes together, enabling the innovations that enrich our work, life and planet. As we pursue this purpose, we are also deeply committed to our role as an important component in creating digital infrastructure. We recently published our 2020 corporate sustainability highlights and I am proud that Equinix once again achieved more than 90% renewable energy coverage for our global data center footprint and received an A minus score for our CDP climate change survey, a leading environmental rating system focused on climate related transparency and action. In January, we announced alongside other providers the formation of the European Climate Neutral data center pact, committed to ensuring data centers in Europe are carbon neutral by 2030. We continue to invest significant resources in our ESG leadership, and will roll out additional global ambitions over the coming quarters in both our environmental and social initiatives. Now turning to our results, as depicted on slide 3, revenues for Q1 were $1.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA was up 10% year-over-year, and AFFO was meaningfully ahead of our expectations. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our leading interconnection franchise continues to perform well with revenues substantially outpacing colocation, growing 13% year-over-year, driven by the continued strength of Equinix Fabric. We now have over 398,000 interconnections and added more organic interconnections year-over-year than the next 10 competitors combined.  In Q1, we added an incremental 6,700 interconnections fueled by hyperscaler build outs and strong enterprise demand, offset by a slight seasonal increase in network grooming activity. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 9% quarter-over-quarter and 28% year-over-year, driven by the cloud and network segments. Equinix Fabric also saw strong growth driven by expanded use of our inter metro offering and continued diversification of n destinations. More than 2,500 customers are now on Fabric and we remain focused on driving higher attach rates for this product across our platform. We're also seeing strong customer interest in our Equinix metal offering and continue to deliver on our commitment to expand the availability and feature set of this offering enabling as a service consumption of our value proposition across 18 Global metros. On the xScale side of our business, we're accelerating our pace and continue to make meaningful progress on our ambitious plans for 2021 as rapid growth in the digital economy, drives increased demand for global cloud connectivity. With our xScale facilities hyperscale companies can add large footprint core deployments to their existing network and onramp footprints at Equinix. Enabling faster time to market and offering direct interconnection to a vibrant ecosystem with their customers and strategic partners. Our more than $3 billion program finance with the support of our JV partners will develop over 290 megawatts across our first two JVs with several more already in the works. We are broadening our reach with the first building of our Dublin five campus which is JV ready, and already 100% pre-leased to a major hyper scalar. Additionally, after quarter end, we pre-leased our entire London 11 asset. These two deals alone represent nearly 40 megawatts of capacity fully committed in advance of delivery. Now, let me cover highlights from our verticals. Please note that we updated our customer segmentation approach to better reflect industry classifications and use cases as well as combined our financial services and enterprise segments to reflect the true scale and momentum of the enterprise opportunity. Going forward, we'll report under these four key verticals. Our network vertical saw strong bookings led by the previously mentioned strength in the Americas as firms expand their capabilities and capacity for digital business and momentum begins to build for industrial 5G applications.  A meaningful part of our network vertical is resale, an indication of the momentum of our channel efforts as we work with partners to deliver more complete solutions to support enterprise digital transformation. Expansions this quarter include British Telecom, a leading telecommunications provider, optimizing network and connecting to multi cloud for their global enterprise and customers. And Elextra, one of the first Mexican cloud service providers leveraging Equinix Fabric to provide a multi-cloud product offering and SUB.CO, a leading subsea cable system development firm deploying a cable node to establish the first route between Oman and Australia. Content and digital media achieved solid bookings as indoor entertainment continues to drive activity in the social media, gaming and streaming platforms. Expansions included marquee wins like Roblox expanding across platform Equinix to support the rapidly growing user base and big data requirements, as well as a global edge cloud provider expanding capacity and deploying network nodes to support accelerating demand for video content. Our cloud and IT vertical delivered strong bookings led by hyperscalers, continuing their global growth, and is worth noting that these bookings results do not include the previously referenced xScale wins, which are additive to this strong retail performance. Q1 was also an exceptional quarter in terms of cloud on ramp additions, with 21 new on ramp wins in the quarter, roughly equivalent to our cumulative volume over the prior four quarters and representing a 75% share of on ramps launched in our metros. As a result, Equinix customers can now enjoy low latency access to multiple clouds in 31 metros across the globe, including eight of the world's top 10 metros by GDP. Expansion this quarter included a fortune 30 software provider deploying infrastructure to support digital transformation and IT initiatives and Everest and Australian cloud services provider specializing in healthcare, expanding to meet country specific data compliance requirements and improve user experience. Our enterprise vertical continued to be a major contributor to overall booking performance, driven by strength in the retail and financial services sub segments, as enterprises shift from pandemic initiatives such as work from home and collaboration to a broader focus on digital transformation. Expansions included CME Group, a top global financial derivatives exchange, expanding their footprint to support growing demand of matching engines resulting from a new platform launch, as well as a leading global airline re-architecting to connect to their preferred network and cloud partners and tap into our growing transportation ecosystem. And our channel program continues to deliver exceptional results, contributing more than 30% of our bookings and accounting for over 60% of our new logos. We had great wins with resellers and our alliance partners including AT&T, Dell and IBM across a wide range of industry segments focused on digital transformation efforts and COVID-19 response. Partner wins included working with Verizon, utilizing their network as a service strategy to help a large US healthcare provider modernize their mission critical contact center, and leverage a new cloud architecture supporting 12 million members across the US, as well as a win with a global Canadian manufacturer deploying in Canada and Germany for WAN optimization and cloud access, utilizing Cisco's SD-WAN solution interconnected to Equinix Fabric. Now let me turn the call over Keith and cover the results for the quarter.\nKeith Taylor: Thanks, Charles. And good afternoon to everyone. On the heels of our record end to 2020 we delivered a great Q1 with strong gross bookings. In fact, our best Q1 ever and our second best net bookings quarter ever with solid performance across virtually all of our key metrics. Our platform continues to shine with strong inter and inter region activity with a high interest in our expanded product and service capabilities, further separating us from our peers. Interconnection revenues now represent 19% of our recurring revenues reflecting our continued interconnection momentum. With a great start to 2021 and increased visibility over the rest of the year, we're raising our guidance substantially across revenues, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share on a constant currency basis. Now let me cover the highlights for the quarter, note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on slide 4, the global Q1 revenues were $1.596 billion, up 7% over the same quarter last year, our 73rd quarter of top line revenue growth due to strong business performance led by the Americas. As expected, nonrecurring revenue decreased quarter-over-quarter to 5% of revenues. But as noted on our last earnings call, we anticipate a meaningful rebound in Q2 MRR due to forecasted custom installation work across a number of markets highlighting the inherent lumpiness of this revenue source. Q1 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $6 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $773 million, up 48% of revenues, up 10% of the same quarter last year, significantly outperforming our expectations due to strong operating performance and net utility costs. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance net of our FX hedges included a $3 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates, and $4 million of integration costs. Global Q1 AFFO was $627 million meaningfully above our expectations due to strong operating performance and more seasonal recurring capital expenditures. Q1 global MRR churn was 2%, a meaningful step down with lower short across all three regions. This improved churn is a reflection of our continued disciplined strategy of selling the platform to the right customer with the right application and into the right footprint. For 2021, we continue to expect MRR churn to average between 2% and 2.5% per quarter. Turning to our regional highlights whose full results are covered on slides 5 through 7. APAC and EMEA were the fastest MRR growing regions on a year-over-year normalized basis at 10% and 9%, respectively, followed by the Americas region at 4%. The Americas region saw continued momentum with record price adjusted gross and net bookings through pricing, and a large step up in cabinets billing. We're seeing good momentum across many markets in the region with particular spans in Dallas, New York and the smaller metros of Denver and Mexico City. We have a strong booked but un-built backlog and continue to expect a large step up in billing cabinet through the first half of 2021 as partially experienced in Q1 and with more to follow in Q2. Based on this momentum, we expect the Americas normalized quarterly revenue growth rate for the remainder of the year to be at or near 6% or better. Also, our prior hedging strategy minimizes the impact our business from the utility price spikes in Texas during extreme weather situation in February. Our power hedging program along with a world class operational management ensured we also protected our customers from these price spikes as well. There is no incremental revenue due to this unexpected weather situation. Definitely our Texas and Oklahoma wind farm settlements trended positively during this quarter. Our EMEA region saw strong bookings in the quarter, including healthy exports and record intra region activity. Although our flat markets remain core to the region's booking engine, we're also seeing increased customer interest in our edge metros with strong momentum in Dublin, Madrid, and Stockholm and our new market of Muscat and our soon to be open Bordeaux facility. Revenue growth remained strong, although moderated from previous levels as expected. As we lap past for successful cross connect repricing initiative. Interconnection revenue stepped up to 13% of recurring revenues, showing continued momentum. And finally, the Asia Pacific region has solid net bookings with good pricing and strong enterprise and cloud growth led by our Singapore and Japan businesses. Utilization rates continue to remain high, but with open capacity in key markets this quarter and will add additional capacity through 2021 to ease potential inventory constraints. And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to slide 8. We ended the quarter with cash of approximately $1.8 billion, an increase over the prior quarter, largely due to our inaugural euro denominated green bond refinancing, which raised EUR 1.1 billion and a weighted average interest rate of 66 basis points. As a result, Equinix now has the lowest weighted average cost of debt capital and the longest weighted average maturity of any publicly traded debt data center company. We also expect to refinance our remaining US or high yield bond over the near term. Further driving down our average cost of debt. Our net debt levels remain low relative to our peers at 3.7x at Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA. We continue to work alongside our credit rating agencies and are pleased to announced that earlier today, S&P upgraded Equinix to BBB flat and widened our leverage tolerance to five times. One, we're very appreciative of the continued support we get from S&P and importantly, we're delighted with this increased financial flexibility. Looking forward as stated previously, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to funding our growth opportunities while creating long-term value for our shareholders. Turning to slide 9 for the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $564 million including recurring CapEx of $20 million. We opened eight new retail projects this quarter adding 7,400 cabinets including a new IBX in Milan. On the xScale side of the business, we opened three new facilities in London, Paris and Tokyo adding an initial 28 megawatts of capacity in our JVs. All this hyperscale capacity has been pre sold. We also purchased land and buildings for development in Montreal and Mexico City. Revenues from owned assets represent 56% of our total revenues now. Our capital investments deliver strong returns as shown on slide 10. Our now 154 stabilize assets increase recurring revenues by 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Also consistent with prior years during Q1 we completed the annual refresh of our IBX categorization exercise. Our stabilized asset count increased by net seven IBXs. These stabilize assets are collectively 85% utilized and generate 27% cash on cash return on the gross PPE 0:20:14.6invested. Now, please refer to slide 11 through 15 for update and summary 2021 guidance and bridges. Do note our 2021 guidance does not include any financial results related to the pending APAC - and acquisition, which is expected to close in Q2, or any future capital market activities. For the full year 2021, we're raising our underlying revenues guidance by $40 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance by $33 million, primarily due to strong operating performance and favorable net utility costs. This guidance implies a normalizing constant currency growth rate of 7% to 8% year-over-year, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 47%. And given the operating momentum of the business, we're raising our 2021 AFFO by $26 million to grow between 10% and 12% on a normalized and constant currency basis, compared to the previous year. We're also raising our 2021 AFFO per share to range to now grow between 9% and 11% on a normalized and constant currency basis. 2021 CapEx is now expected to range between $2.725 billion and $2.975 billion, including approximately $180 million of recurrent CapEx spend, which represents about 3% of revenues. This guidance also includes an incremental $200 million of balance sheet xScale project, funds that we expect to recover, after contributing these investments into our current and our future jayvees. So let me start here, I'll turn the call back to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thanks, Keith. In closing, we had a terrific start to the year. As evidenced by our results, the demand backdrop for digital transformation remains strong. And I'm very pleased with our Q1 execution and the continued progress against our key areas of focus. As the world's digital infrastructure company, we are supporting service providers of every size and shape to build out their infrastructure of the digital edge, infrastructure that is more global, more distributed and more cloud connected than ever before. And together, we're leveraging the power of our platform to cultivate scaled digital ecosystems, enabling our enterprise customers to access all the right places, all the right partners and all the right possibilities, as they transform their businesses and seek to accelerate their digital advantage. On behalf of the 13,000 plus dedicated members of the Equinix family around the world, I want to say thank you to our 10,000 customers for the trust they place in Equinix. Finally, we look forward to our Analysts Day in June, where we'll continue to the discussion of our highly differentiated business model, outlined the enormous opportunity ahead and discuss the actions we are taking and the investments we are making to drive sustained, long-term value creation for our investors and our customers. So let me stop there and open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets.\nAriKlein: Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about the lower churn in the quarter? What specifically is driving that and whether or not maybe longer term, you see a path to maybe coming down from that 8% to 10% range that you typically see.\nCharlesMeyers: Sure, Ari. Yes, obviously a great quarter on churn, really, as you said in the script, one of the best we've had in a number of years. And, probably a little bit of timing there. We were - we had some kind of pull forward. And we probably pushed a little bit out, but I would say that I think that we are, we continue to believe and as we've talked about this many times that the best, our best way of managing churn is to continue to be really disciplined in our targeting and our execution of the go-to- market engine. And I think that we're seeing that. The mix of business continues to be right on the money for what we want, I think we're selling a lot of business into that the sweet spot of sort of small to mid-size, interconnection heavy applications and use cases. And again, I think that's going to bode well for us over time. So I mentioned this in several other forums, which is we have been the last two quarters up towards the high end of the range, and even slightly over run in q4. But now down right at the bottom of the range. And I think we're really seeing positive trending on the churn. So and we have efforts underway to really identify all of the really project out and look at churn, churn risk in the business in a very sophisticated way, identify and get ahead of it. And I think we're seeing real dividends from that.\nAriKlein: Got it, thanks. And then just maybe quickly on the new customer additions, it seems like you're a little bit off the recent pace, there is obviously a lot of activity and you're investing in the go-to-market, is that an area we should expect to see an uptick over the next few quarters?\nCharlesMeyers: Yes, I mean, I think that we're - our new logo additions continue to be strong, we had good momentum in new logos through the course of 2020. Q1 is a little bit of a seasonally soft quarter for new logo additions, typically, but we saw good results, I think enterprise demand continues to be very strong, our aggregate customer count is not going up as fast as our new logos, due to a variety of factors, including the fact that we are seeing some consolidation activity at the parent account level, we see some other movement in terms of people leaving the system either due to smaller, some smaller customers that might be leaving the system due to financial constraints or other things. But I would say overall we were seeing good, healthy new logo ads. And I think we're - we expect continuing to see the new customer count grow.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jon Atkin with RBC.\nJonathanAtkin: Thanks. Question about slide 19 on xScale, and then slide 23 on kind of the lease renewal. So, xScale, I'm just wondering, if outlines stuff it's opened up, so it's kind of in the pipeline? Is that the right kind of cadence to think about going forward? Or could that potentially accelerate. And if you could remind us how that translates into fee income, there's like four different ways you get paid, but some of that may be more front loaded than others before, where you would get the revenue before or recognize revenues before the customer actually moves in. And then on slide 23, just on the lease renewals, I'm wondering, what would be a realistic remaining pipeline to think about that would enable you to convert these properties to own properties? Or is it mainly a matter of managing your renewals going forward? Thanks.\nCharlesMeyers: Sure. Jonathan, why don't I start with a little bit of color on xScale at a macro level? And then Keith, if you want to jump in and share a little bit more on the fee streams and their impact in flow through into the business, that'd be great. And then we'll pick up the second question. But look, we're delighted with and the efforts of Krupal, and the xScale team and in the group of people supporting them from within the core Equinix, as well as the support we're getting from our partner at GIC, is things are really humming in terms of the xScale business. Obviously, we talked about the fact that we've had great pre-leasing activity on the facilities that we put out there, I think there is an opportunity for us to increase the pace, and we're going to come back to the Analyst Day, and really talk about kind of what we would see as the scope of opportunity for xScale going forward. As you'll recall, we talked about that in 2018, at the Analyst Day. And I think that we were - we certainly, I've said in a number of other forums, that we're trending more towards the high end of that. And I think we'll give more clarity on what's possible, we think in the xScale, business, but we're targeting the pieces of the pie out there that we think are really strategically important and add to the overall platform value. And again, we're seeing really good momentum in the business right now. I do think there's an opportunity for us to continue to pick up the pace. So Keith why don't you comment on the fee streams and impact in the fall through.\nKeithTaylor: Sure. So Jon, as always, the fees, there's four fee streams, two are recurring in nature and two are nonrecurring. And then the fifth, if you will, stream of value that comes in is global line through income, equity to affiliated entities. So basically, that's our equity ownership in the business. Now, having said all of that, you are starting to see the momentum picked up, as we announced in our prepared remarks, we introduced three new assets in this quarter, and all of them are pre sold. And so it gives you a sense that the momentum is picking, is picking up quite substantially with a fairly robust opportunity in front of us. So what you're going to start to see in the coming quarters is some nonrecurring aspects of the fee income, but you're really going to start to see a ramp up of the recurring fee stream as well. And, again, we'll talk more about it on in the June Analyst Day, but suffice it to say it is exciting to see the momentum coming from that team. Yes, so let me just leave it there. I think we answered your question.\nCharlesMeyers: Keith, why don't you pick up the lease renewals as well, and just what the opportunity might be for us to continue to increase ownership.\nKeithTaylor: Sure. And then the second one, as you're talking about Jon about the lease properties, there's a number of transactions that we are currently in the middle of, they are - we have negotiated the purchase price, the purchase of those acquisitions is built into our forward guide, no surprise to you both as relates to cash, but also the anticipated consumption of those lease arrangements inside our financials. So we are continuing to acquire, where we can, there are some that are that clearly are more important than others. And so where we can, we will focus on those that are the most important. Yet at the same time, as we think about our future growth. I think if my memory serves roughly 75%, of all of our future growth right now is on property that is owned or we have a long-term arrangement with our grand lease, and it's 75% is going into major metros, notwithstanding the fact that we still have 30 plus over 35 projects underway across the world in many, many metros in many, many countries. So all that said is you'll start to see that continue to go up, it takes time. And then we'll, I should say, we will answer when we're closer, but suffice it to say there are some transactions that we are anticipating to announce over the not-too-distant future.\nJonathanAtkin: Understood. And then just lastly, if I could squeeze this in, the Americas margins came in a lot higher, at least than we were expecting any kind of drivers of that or color you can provide.\nKeithTaylor: I think prepared remarks that I had, and like, first and foremost, the business is performing exceedingly well, the Americas business. One of the things when we report there's two aspects to it and there's the, if you will, the fundamental business that will compare apple-to-apple versus the APAC region, the EMEA region, and then there's the corporate overlay. So if I tell you more specifically the Americas region in and of itself, without the corporate overlay, margins are continuing to improve largely because we have very strong interconnection activity, where we continue to grow our customer base and our scale, and we're driving more profitability into the business. So that's the, if you will, the easy response. The second part is that just as timing of expenses, as you know, between Q3, Q4 and then this quarter, there's been some movement of costs around different quarters. And as a result we started to see the benefit of those of that movement in Q and Q4. Specifically, as a relates to Q1 though, again one of the comments we made was that we have a very strong utility costs for power hedging program, our operational team operate our businesses very, very effectively the assets, particularly in the Americas, and in this particular case, Texas. And so we have a strong hedging program that protected us against those spikes in price. But we also have a wind farm arrangement, where both in Texas, and in Oklahoma, we have wind farms. And so we had some benefits attached to that. And then there's some seasonality around a repairs and maintenance expense. But overall, you're seeing fundamentally a US business, our Americas business it is performing exceedingly well and continue to drive margin into its financials offset by the corporate investments that we've been making.\nCharlesMeyers: And mix a business was really good in the quarter two in terms of strong MRR performance, which always helps the margin. So, yes, really good quarter, we are continuing to invest. We're being disciplined about the pace of that. But and we obviously were pleased with the margin performance, and we do have an eye on margin expansion as a priority for us over time.\nOperator: The next question is from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse.\nSamiBadri: Hi, thank you. My first question is to do to visit back on xScale. I know you guys have laid out quite a bit of information on that recently. But the one thing I think that would be very helpful is when we look at the originally published returns that you guys were targeting between 13% and 17%. I believe in the 2018 Analyst Day, did that include all the various forms of income that you're going to be generating from the xScale venture. And is also that the same yield range we should be thinking about for the xScale business.\nCharlesMeyers: Keith, do you want to take that?\nKeithTaylor: Sure. We're driving Charles direct traffic since we're in two different places. So pardon the pause. So as it relates xScale, look, number one is going to be very market dependent, right. Some markets are more competitive than other markets and you're looking at unlevered anywhere from sort of unlevered returns of 8% to 12% at the project level, we get a p stream on top of that. And then of course, we put - we some debt on the business. So as a result, when you look at hopefully Equinix position our return profile is as good if not better than what we've shared. Now, having said all of that, if you ask me on a specific project, there'll be some variation. But the team under Krupal's leadership is working really, really well. Not only with our construction team, but with our JV partners, to make sure that we get the right returns and we're negotiating appropriate with the various hyperscalers to get a good long-term contract. So overall, again, I'll just say that there's no material variance from what we said the bending is a little bit better. And as Charles made in his prior comments, in fact, there's probably a broader or bigger appetite over the coming quarters and years, though, given the momentum that we're seeing that you'd see maybe us do more than we originally anticipated, from the June 2018 Analyst Day.\nSamiBadri: Got it. Thank you. And then just one quick follow up for you, Keith, is I know that guide does not include any further capital markets activity, and you did mention that you're looking to retire the high yield debt that you have, are you going to reissue that as green debt or in another region? Are you targeting, do you have something in mind for when you do revisit that?\nKeithTaylor: Yes, Sami, no surprise to you, there'll be an element of green attached to any transaction that we do, we do anticipate that we will retard over the newer term, as I said, there's a relatively strong positive impact associated with that. And, again, I'll let everybody do the math. And what that is but there will be a blend of perhaps 5, 7, 10 maybe even 30-year terms that make sense that we go out that far, some of them will be green, that would be that tend to be on the shorter end of the curve. And then the only other thing I would say is to extent that we can, we will take advantage of those - the opportunity to make sure that we can retire some of our foreign debt, where possible and arbitrage over a favorable sort of interest rate environment. And the last thing I just want to say is again, we're delighted with the work that our Treasury team has been doing under Melanie's leadership, to negotiate with S&P and get a favorable upgrade. But what was really important here is more financial flexibility. And as many of you have asked over, both in our private sessions, but also on some of the calls, we've always wanted to have more financial flexibility as it relates to debt. And no surprise to everybody debts are cheapest source of capital. And as a result, you will see us continue to focus on refinancing the debt and then also using debt where appropriate, with some balance to equity, to make sure that we create this long-term investment portfolio that we've announced, from our perspective, I just think it was the best of all situations today that not only getting that upgrade, but also having the flexibility to drive down our cost of capital.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi.\nMichaelRollins: Thanks and good afternoon. First, I was just curious if you can just unpack a little bit more of the organic increase in the annual revenue guidance. I think that was up $40 million. And when you consider the size of that change on $6 billion of revenue last year, how does that fit into the organic, constant currency revenue growth guidance range of 7% to 8% for 2021 that was unchanged from when you provided that in the fourth quarter. And then just secondly, just a follow up on xScale. So it seems that for some of the projects, before they enter into the joint venture, you're taking some of this on balance sheet, you're running some of this on balance sheet from just a high-level perspective. Can you just help frame how we should think about the financial impacts? If that's happening relative to what's the core operating business and strategy. Thanks.\nCharlesMeyers: Sure. Well, Keith, why don't you go ahead and grab the revenue guide, and we can a pair up on the XScale follow up?\nKeithTaylor: Yes, So Michael, I think there are a couple things. One, when we do the charts, the charts that we've shared in the earnings deck with everybody, we really try to simplify it. There are two aspects to it. One is what is - how are the underlying business performance and its $40 million and uplift. The second part is what currency and based on the forecast rates that we're using it's 61 million down graph. But frankly, if I took the spot rates from today, which we don't do the day off, we also we have forecast rates, that $61 million would more would be cut in half, if not by more, just to give you a perspective. Having said all that, when you look at the fundamental underlying business, it's all about the rounding again, what we've done is we've taken a step up, added $40 million of revenue on $6 billion business. And now you're starting to see us move up into the range in the 7% to 8% range. So before the bottom end of the range, it was slightly below 7%. Now, you're basically you're in - you're well into the range on the 7% to 8%. Again, this is the first step that we've made since the Q4 earnings call, again, there's momentum in the business, and we're just delighted by the ability to be able to raise $40 million on the underlying business.\nMichaelRollins: And where's that $40 million coming from? Regionally or activity supplies?\nKeithTaylor: Yes, I mean, as it relates to our sort of our comments around the Americas business. I'm sure it wasn't lost and you was right to look at our comment that the Americas business for the next three quarters, it's going to be at our 6%, if not better, and so it gives you a sense of the Americas business, it had a record, not only a record bookings quarter, certainly on the net basis, the churn is moderate. And as a result, you're getting in Americas business continuing to perform. And so that's one aspect of it. And then the other two regions sort of down the middle there some aspect due to our prior pricing uplift in Europe sort of having the lappy through, if you will, those price increases, and some of the accounting adjustments we made last year. But the reality is that overall; the business is performing well across our platform.  And that's what excites us most, that if I was to say one specific thing it\u2019s the Americas business, we're just delighted by the momentum that we're seeing. Charles made the comment in his prepared remarks, and there\u2019s over 4,000 transactions with over 3,000 customers in the quarter. We are operating at a scale that is just so substantial. And by the way, our pipeline is exceedingly strong. And so as a combination of all that, that has given us the confidence and the visibility to raise our guidance at this juncture. And we still have three quarters to go. And by the way an Analyst Day.\nCharlesMeyers: Yes, and then on the XScale piece, Mike, yes, we are kind of leaning in, and moving projects forward, even advance of those being into the JV structure, because we think the market opportunity kind of is there to grab. And, as Keith said in his script that there's a couple 100 million dollars there, we would expect to come out of that and sort of macro guide he gave overall, which would come in the form of reimbursement once those facilities move into the JV. And so that's something that we -- and but I would say that we our preference obviously, is for projects to be into the JV from the beginning. And I think we're now at a point where many of the projects will be able to do that with, but especially in markets where we are looking to either form new JVs or due to other circumstances, we are leaning in taking advantage of the strength of our balance sheet to move those things forward. But then looking to get, obviously, those things get reimbursed and come back to us, given that we're, again, our capital commitment into those projects is basically, one year that sort of a 10 to 1 ratio, since we're 20% owners, and we expect leverage on those projects.\nKeithTaylor: And if I can just add on to what Charles said there, I think the most important part is to recognize so when we do an uplift, like we said in this particular case of our CapEx spend, unfortunately, when you look at our financials, it looks like our CapEx has been elevated, but ultimately, when we get that reimbursement from the joint venture, it comes to a different line. And so it will be the sale or disposition of that construction and progress into the JV. And so basically, it's a gross up, if you will. And so that's how it gets represented, but going forward as Charles said, our objective is to do most of this work inside the JV instead of on our balance sheet. And we're working really hard and we'll probably spend some more. I anticipate we'll spend much more energy talking about this at the Analyst Day, because I think there's a really good story around that particular topic.\nOperator: The next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya from Mizuho.\nOmotayoOkusanya: Yes. Good evening. Congrats on the solid quarter. My question has to do more around some of the effects, or the FX impact. When I take a look at the new guidance assumption, just around the Singapore dollar or the Euro or the pound, it seems like there's an assumption here that those currencies are going to get, that the dollar is going to get stronger against those currencies. But all, we're really seeing the dollar getting weaker. So I guess I'm struggling a little bit with why the new FX assumptions are assuming the strength in the dollar, which is kind of causing this FX drag on to kind of otherwise, kind of stellar quarter and outlook.\nKeithTaylor: Sure. Do you want me to take that, Charles or -\nCharlesMeyers: You bet, yes, all yours.\nKeithTaylor: Okay, thank you for the question. And sort of thanks for raising it. I think if you were to step back and say what is the overall bias to the US dollar, it's for the US dollar to get weaker. And that is something that we anticipate. Having said all of that, when we go through our exercises to forecast and reforecast like every quarter, we have to look at the prevailing rates, irrespective of what they might be in the future. And so as a company, when we on the Q4 for call, if you recall, we took on 100. And there's $106 million, if you will, when that are back from the weakening of the US dollar versus the basket of currencies that we operate in. This quarter that actually reverse when we analyze the impact avails it was $61 million headwind. But as I said in one of my other responses, that's based on our forecast rate, so we use when we read it reforecast of the year, and we've given you the guidance, how you use the spot rates of today, there basically is that $61 million would drop, actually by $45 million. So it tells you that the US Dollar weakened again. So again, we try and bring a lot of discipline to how we message. It's at the point in time, if you do the forecast; we are not projecting forward on what might happen. If it does happen, then you'll see a benefit. And you'll see that benefit primarily because roughly 60% of our revenues are earned in currencies other than the US dollar. And so when the US dollar weakens, again, recognize we do have some hedges, and they take time to burn off, then you will see uplift in revenue accordingly. So hopefully that answers your question. And let me stop there and just see if I did answer your question.\nOmotayoOkusanya: Yes, that's actually very helpful. Now, I kind of understand some of the nuances around that. But if you can just indulge me with one more. I mean, when you were at the beginning of the year, it was a lot of concern, just around expansion of sales cycles whether it was in the hyperscale side, or whether it was on the enterprise side. Could you just talk a little bit about again, it seems like given your stellar quarter and some of the comments you've made about your verticals that really isn't a concern anymore. Is that a fair statement?\nCharlesMeyers: Yes, we I mean, honestly, we hadn't really experienced that other than I think in the very acute periods of COVID, where people were trying to sort of just figure out how to make the transition to work from home and really dealing with matters of survival. We did not see any sort of extension significant extension of the selling cycle, in fact, I would say that, I think what we're finding is that we're improving our skill set and capability of delivering the sort of the digital transformation-oriented messaging to our enterprise prospects and seeing good momentum in terms of bringing those sales cycle down. And so, yes, we haven't seen that hyperscale sales cycles are a little longer, but I wouldn't say they have protracted, in fact, I think we've made really good progress with several of our key hyperscale customers, trying to define more repeatable terms that we can do business under, which is compressing the timeframe in which we can get deals done. And it's been - that's been an important priority for us and one that we have really put a lot of energy into late and it's really important to our partners and customers. So I would say no, I feel good about sales cycle right now. In fact, I think when we're looking at our funnel, we are seeing a very deep funnel and we're feeling like conversion rates and conversion timing, support optimism about the remainder of the year, which is all kind of reflected in our guidance.\nOperator: The next question comes from Colby Synesael from Cowen.\nColbySynesael: Great, thank you. Few questions. So on the - 2Q - yes on Q2 guidance. You mentioned you're using a wider range just given what could be some; I guess volatility within the nonrecurring portion. I was wondering if you could just give us some sense of what you're thinking MRR might look like and could we step back up to the levels we saw in the fourth quarter? And is that a better assumption going forward? And then secondly, just a point of clarification on your CapEx guidance, you maintain the guidance at $2.125 to $2.315 for the nonrecurring portion, but is that including the 425 to 475 for xScale, it felt like you were saying in your prepared remarks that it is included, but the way at least the press release looks like reads, at least reads to me like it's excluded. So I just want to get clarification there. And then just real quickly as relates to the Analyst Day, obviously, xScale is going to be a big focus. It's been a big focus of questions this evening. What else are you planning? Like what is the big focus? I mean, where do you think that investors are maybe a little bit off in terms of their thinking that companies really want to make sure you're going to be hitting home on. Thank you.\nCharlesMeyers: Keith why don't you talk about the Q2 revenue range, and MRR and then the xScale CapEx? And I'll pick up that last piece on the Analyst Day focus.\nKeithTaylor: Sure. Yes, Colby, as it relates to the nonrecurring, I think what you could see is that means they step up to if you think about Q4 of '20, you're at - you're starting to get to a percentage of nonrecurring revenue that could look something like that. As we said in the prepared remarks, and again, I know this quite well, because of some of the work that we're doing. And I made a reference a couple quarters back, that there are some large installations that were taking place in the first half of the year, it looks like that those will close and install in Q2, as a result, you'll see a step up, again, look, be more reflective of what you - the percent of revenue coming from nonrecurring that we saw in Q4. And then it moderate back down higher than Q1, but moderate back down more - to a more reasonable level for Q3 and Q4. So hopefully, is that helpful? I want to make sure -\nColbySynesael: Yes, it's perfect. Thank you.\nCharlesMeyers: And then on the xScale, CapEx, Keith.\nKeithTaylor: Yes, I'm sorry, pardon me, as it relates the xScale CapEx that is included number.\nColbySynesael: And then relative to Analyst Day, there'll be a number of things, yes; we will definitely talk about the momentum in the xScale business. Again, it will start flowing through and at least in positively impacting the overall business. But again, since we don't consolidate revenue there it's not going to be a major driver there other than some very positive flow through on the fee streams, and, of course, the continued strategic importance of that to our platform, overall. But I think our focus is going to be speaking about the overall opportunity giving some additional color on our views on the addressable market, and how it's expanding and how our relevance to digital transformation continues to increase in the eyes of our customers, we'll talk about what we're doing to continue to evolve our go-to-market engine to respond to that, including how we're, what we're doing on the channel side of things. We'll also talk about our roadmap for digital services, and how we're adding to and scaling capabilities like network edge and Equinix metal, and maybe what we have on the horizon in terms of how those digital services are really going to be responsive to how our customers are thinking about consuming and adapting their digital infrastructure for the world ahead. And I think that we're now we're continuing to see great momentum, great response from our customers, and we're eager to hear and share those things coming in June.\nOperator: And the next question comes from David Guarino with Green Street.\nDavidGuarino: Hey, thanks. Last quarter you guys mentioned the development yields for xScale have declined since you initially entered the hyperscale space. Can you just maybe talk about what's happened to hyperscale cap rates over that same timeframe and what that might mean for Equinix and their ability to achieve better pricing on JV than the initial ones that were done in GIC?\nCharlesMeyers: Yes, I mean, I would say that we did mention that and as Keith said, I think that our overall return profile continues to look very attractive in terms of what we think post fees and post leverage the kinds of returns that we're going to be getting on those projects. Although, as he also said, it is a wide range depending on individual projects and individual sort of market circumstances, because I do think there are markets where we've seen that, because I think Keith quoted 8 to 12 is the sort of yields that we're looking at in terms of a range, and there are markets that are certainly at the low end of that, where due to a variety of circumstances, and just the overall competitive nature of the market. But I think in terms of, I think we we're very pleased with the nature of our relationship with GIC, we think that we can continue to extend that and have other JVs of similar ilk around the world, under very favorable set of terms, we find ourselves to be very attractive partner, and based on the engagement that we've had, as we've looked at these JVs. And so we expect, we're going to be able to get very favorable terms for those partnerships, and having them be very much a win-win. So, Keith, I don't know if you want to add anything on that last topic relative to the cap rates.\nKeithTaylor: No. I think that was reflected in the comments. Again, it will be specific to the market, again, when we look at the project level, and then there's a p stream for Equinix. And then the leverage that we put on the business, and overall, we're pleased with the business. And, again, we're going to spend a lot more energy talking about this in the June Analyst Day, and we will be able to break out and give you a little bit more color. I think that will make you probably more satisfied with the overall project, Dave.\nDavidGuarino: Okay, no, that's helpful. And then maybe one more question. We haven't really talked about this topic in a while. But could you share your thoughts on public-to-public M&A for the data center REIT sector, and if Equinix could be a potential player in that?\nCharlesMeyers: Sure, I'll comment and Keith if you want to add, feel free. We again, we have always believed and we've been quite successful using M&A as a tool in terms of thinking about how to expand our business and create value for our customers and for our shareholders. That hasn't changed; we continue to believe that there are opportunities out there. I would say that probably more of them are aligned around in the private markets. And we've clearly been active in that regard filling out our platform geographically, and adding key scale in locations in some of our markets around the world. But we're not going to be if we felt like there were transactions that we think were highly strategic, and we're the right economics in terms of how they deal with flow through an accretion basis that we're going to be open to those things. But I'd say there's probably a little bias we're in right now more towards private opportunities and greater opportunities in the private markets, but we're going to always be have our eyes wide open.\nOperator: And the last question comes from Erik Rasmussen from Stifel.\nErikRasmussen: Yes, thanks. Maybe just back on xScale, you really have been leaning into that initiative over the past few quarters. Can you just maybe comment on the environment as relates to the hyperscalars? Is this more concentrated with a few of the leaders? Or is it more broad based?\nCharlesMeyers: Yes, I mean, when we formulated the xScale entity and approach, we talked about a range of players there that would be that we would pursue relationships with and pursue business with. It is to some degree concentrated, I think that's just that's the nature of the hyperscaler community today, is that they the largest end of that is taking up more of the overall demand, or providing more of the overall demand. So it's concentrated at some level, but we have had significant success beyond sort of the three or four that would pop to mind for people right off the top of their head. And so, I think we're going to continue to evaluate those opportunities. But I and I would say that we're really continuing to build on a strong relationship we've had with that full hyperscale community for a very long time, because as I talked about with our - when I characterize our hyperscale relationships at the Analyst Day in 2018, we - they are amongst our largest customers, many of them, and that is a lot of it on the backs of really the important role that we play in terms of their network nodes, their on ramps, and other elements of their infrastructure, outside of sort of availability zones, and really large core deployments that might be more of the focus for xScale. So it's a very multifaceted relationship that we have with them. They're critical, we believe that as people drop adopt hybrid in multi cloud as the architecture of choice, we think doing that at Equinix is really going to be a priority for them in terms of both superior economics and performance. And so their relationships that we have with the xScale, with the hyper scalars are very important to us, and certainly too some degree concentrated from a demand basis, but we're continuing to strive to extend that to larger portfolio customers.\nErikRasmussen: Great, maybe just my last, my follow up then any change in a competitive environment in Europe, around DLR and Interaction year after that deal is closed especially as it also appears that investment activity has picked up and demand still seems to be pretty robust there.\nCharlesMeyers: Yes, I would say no, not really. I mean, I think we continue to feel very good about our overall competitive position in Europe, as I said Interaction is, has always been a very critical, credible pan European player there and I think that continues to be the case. But we have, what we think is a much stronger global story. And I've had great success in the market and am going to continue to build on that success and we feel good about our position there.\nKatrina Rymill: Thank you. That concludes our Q1 call. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. And thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Keith Taylor",
            "content": "Thanks, Charles. And good afternoon to everyone. On the heels of our record end to 2020 we delivered a great Q1 with strong gross bookings. In fact, our best Q1 ever and our second best net bookings quarter ever with solid performance across virtually all of our key metrics. Our platform continues to shine with strong inter and inter region activity with a high interest in our expanded product and service capabilities, further separating us from our peers. Interconnection revenues now represent 19% of our recurring revenues reflecting our continued interconnection momentum. With a great start to 2021 and increased visibility over the rest of the year, we're raising our guidance substantially across revenues, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share on a constant currency basis. Now let me cover the highlights for the quarter, note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on slide 4, the global Q1 revenues were $1.596 billion, up 7% over the same quarter last year, our 73rd quarter of top line revenue growth due to strong business performance led by the Americas. As expected, nonrecurring revenue decreased quarter-over-quarter to 5% of revenues. But as noted on our last earnings call, we anticipate a meaningful rebound in Q2 MRR due to forecasted custom installation work across a number of markets highlighting the inherent lumpiness of this revenue source. Q1 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $6 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $773 million, up 48% of revenues, up 10% of the same quarter last year, significantly outperforming our expectations due to strong operating performance and net utility costs. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance net of our FX hedges included a $3 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates, and $4 million of integration costs. Global Q1 AFFO was $627 million meaningfully above our expectations due to strong operating performance and more seasonal recurring capital expenditures. Q1 global MRR churn was 2%, a meaningful step down with lower short across all three regions. This improved churn is a reflection of our continued disciplined strategy of selling the platform to the right customer with the right application and into the right footprint. For 2021, we continue to expect MRR churn to average between 2% and 2.5% per quarter. Turning to our regional highlights whose full results are covered on slides 5 through 7. APAC and EMEA were the fastest MRR growing regions on a year-over-year normalized basis at 10% and 9%, respectively, followed by the Americas region at 4%. The Americas region saw continued momentum with record price adjusted gross and net bookings through pricing, and a large step up in cabinets billing. We're seeing good momentum across many markets in the region with particular spans in Dallas, New York and the smaller metros of Denver and Mexico City. We have a strong booked but un-built backlog and continue to expect a large step up in billing cabinet through the first half of 2021 as partially experienced in Q1 and with more to follow in Q2. Based on this momentum, we expect the Americas normalized quarterly revenue growth rate for the remainder of the year to be at or near 6% or better. Also, our prior hedging strategy minimizes the impact our business from the utility price spikes in Texas during extreme weather situation in February. Our power hedging program along with a world class operational management ensured we also protected our customers from these price spikes as well. There is no incremental revenue due to this unexpected weather situation. Definitely our Texas and Oklahoma wind farm settlements trended positively during this quarter. Our EMEA region saw strong bookings in the quarter, including healthy exports and record intra region activity. Although our flat markets remain core to the region's booking engine, we're also seeing increased customer interest in our edge metros with strong momentum in Dublin, Madrid, and Stockholm and our new market of Muscat and our soon to be open Bordeaux facility. Revenue growth remained strong, although moderated from previous levels as expected. As we lap past for successful cross connect repricing initiative. Interconnection revenue stepped up to 13% of recurring revenues, showing continued momentum. And finally, the Asia Pacific region has solid net bookings with good pricing and strong enterprise and cloud growth led by our Singapore and Japan businesses. Utilization rates continue to remain high, but with open capacity in key markets this quarter and will add additional capacity through 2021 to ease potential inventory constraints. And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to slide 8. We ended the quarter with cash of approximately $1.8 billion, an increase over the prior quarter, largely due to our inaugural euro denominated green bond refinancing, which raised EUR 1.1 billion and a weighted average interest rate of 66 basis points. As a result, Equinix now has the lowest weighted average cost of debt capital and the longest weighted average maturity of any publicly traded debt data center company. We also expect to refinance our remaining US or high yield bond over the near term. Further driving down our average cost of debt. Our net debt levels remain low relative to our peers at 3.7x at Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA. We continue to work alongside our credit rating agencies and are pleased to announced that earlier today, S&P upgraded Equinix to BBB flat and widened our leverage tolerance to five times. One, we're very appreciative of the continued support we get from S&P and importantly, we're delighted with this increased financial flexibility. Looking forward as stated previously, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to funding our growth opportunities while creating long-term value for our shareholders. Turning to slide 9 for the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $564 million including recurring CapEx of $20 million. We opened eight new retail projects this quarter adding 7,400 cabinets including a new IBX in Milan. On the xScale side of the business, we opened three new facilities in London, Paris and Tokyo adding an initial 28 megawatts of capacity in our JVs. All this hyperscale capacity has been pre sold. We also purchased land and buildings for development in Montreal and Mexico City. Revenues from owned assets represent 56% of our total revenues now. Our capital investments deliver strong returns as shown on slide 10. Our now 154 stabilize assets increase recurring revenues by 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Also consistent with prior years during Q1 we completed the annual refresh of our IBX categorization exercise. Our stabilized asset count increased by net seven IBXs. These stabilize assets are collectively 85% utilized and generate 27% cash on cash return on the gross PPE 0:20:14.6invested. Now, please refer to slide 11 through 15 for update and summary 2021 guidance and bridges. Do note our 2021 guidance does not include any financial results related to the pending APAC - and acquisition, which is expected to close in Q2, or any future capital market activities. For the full year 2021, we're raising our underlying revenues guidance by $40 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance by $33 million, primarily due to strong operating performance and favorable net utility costs. This guidance implies a normalizing constant currency growth rate of 7% to 8% year-over-year, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 47%. And given the operating momentum of the business, we're raising our 2021 AFFO by $26 million to grow between 10% and 12% on a normalized and constant currency basis, compared to the previous year. We're also raising our 2021 AFFO per share to range to now grow between 9% and 11% on a normalized and constant currency basis. 2021 CapEx is now expected to range between $2.725 billion and $2.975 billion, including approximately $180 million of recurrent CapEx spend, which represents about 3% of revenues. This guidance also includes an incremental $200 million of balance sheet xScale project, funds that we expect to recover, after contributing these investments into our current and our future jayvees. So let me start here, I'll turn the call back to Charles. Sure. So Jon, as always, the fees, there's four fee streams, two are recurring in nature and two are nonrecurring. And then the fifth, if you will, stream of value that comes in is global line through income, equity to affiliated entities. So basically, that's our equity ownership in the business. Now, having said all of that, you are starting to see the momentum picked up, as we announced in our prepared remarks, we introduced three new assets in this quarter, and all of them are pre sold. And so it gives you a sense that the momentum is picking, is picking up quite substantially with a fairly robust opportunity in front of us. So what you're going to start to see in the coming quarters is some nonrecurring aspects of the fee income, but you're really going to start to see a ramp up of the recurring fee stream as well. And, again, we'll talk more about it on in the June Analyst Day, but suffice it to say it is exciting to see the momentum coming from that team. Yes, so let me just leave it there. I think we answered your question. Sure. And then the second one, as you're talking about Jon about the lease properties, there's a number of transactions that we are currently in the middle of, they are - we have negotiated the purchase price, the purchase of those acquisitions is built into our forward guide, no surprise to you both as relates to cash, but also the anticipated consumption of those lease arrangements inside our financials. So we are continuing to acquire, where we can, there are some that are that clearly are more important than others. And so where we can, we will focus on those that are the most important. Yet at the same time, as we think about our future growth. I think if my memory serves roughly 75%, of all of our future growth right now is on property that is owned or we have a long-term arrangement with our grand lease, and it's 75% is going into major metros, notwithstanding the fact that we still have 30 plus over 35 projects underway across the world in many, many metros in many, many countries. So all that said is you'll start to see that continue to go up, it takes time. And then we'll, I should say, we will answer when we're closer, but suffice it to say there are some transactions that we are anticipating to announce over the not-too-distant future. I think prepared remarks that I had, and like, first and foremost, the business is performing exceedingly well, the Americas business. One of the things when we report there's two aspects to it and there's the, if you will, the fundamental business that will compare apple-to-apple versus the APAC region, the EMEA region, and then there's the corporate overlay. So if I tell you more specifically the Americas region in and of itself, without the corporate overlay, margins are continuing to improve largely because we have very strong interconnection activity, where we continue to grow our customer base and our scale, and we're driving more profitability into the business. So that's the, if you will, the easy response. The second part is that just as timing of expenses, as you know, between Q3, Q4 and then this quarter, there's been some movement of costs around different quarters. And as a result we started to see the benefit of those of that movement in Q and Q4. Specifically, as a relates to Q1 though, again one of the comments we made was that we have a very strong utility costs for power hedging program, our operational team operate our businesses very, very effectively the assets, particularly in the Americas, and in this particular case, Texas. And so we have a strong hedging program that protected us against those spikes in price. But we also have a wind farm arrangement, where both in Texas, and in Oklahoma, we have wind farms. And so we had some benefits attached to that. And then there's some seasonality around a repairs and maintenance expense. But overall, you're seeing fundamentally a US business, our Americas business it is performing exceedingly well and continue to drive margin into its financials offset by the corporate investments that we've been making. Sure. We're driving Charles direct traffic since we're in two different places. So pardon the pause. So as it relates xScale, look, number one is going to be very market dependent, right. Some markets are more competitive than other markets and you're looking at unlevered anywhere from sort of unlevered returns of 8% to 12% at the project level, we get a p stream on top of that. And then of course, we put - we some debt on the business. So as a result, when you look at hopefully Equinix position our return profile is as good if not better than what we've shared. Now, having said all of that, if you ask me on a specific project, there'll be some variation. But the team under Krupal's leadership is working really, really well. Not only with our construction team, but with our JV partners, to make sure that we get the right returns and we're negotiating appropriate with the various hyperscalers to get a good long-term contract. So overall, again, I'll just say that there's no material variance from what we said the bending is a little bit better. And as Charles made in his prior comments, in fact, there's probably a broader or bigger appetite over the coming quarters and years, though, given the momentum that we're seeing that you'd see maybe us do more than we originally anticipated, from the June 2018 Analyst Day. Yes, Sami, no surprise to you, there'll be an element of green attached to any transaction that we do, we do anticipate that we will retard over the newer term, as I said, there's a relatively strong positive impact associated with that. And, again, I'll let everybody do the math. And what that is but there will be a blend of perhaps 5, 7, 10 maybe even 30-year terms that make sense that we go out that far, some of them will be green, that would be that tend to be on the shorter end of the curve. And then the only other thing I would say is to extent that we can, we will take advantage of those - the opportunity to make sure that we can retire some of our foreign debt, where possible and arbitrage over a favorable sort of interest rate environment. And the last thing I just want to say is again, we're delighted with the work that our Treasury team has been doing under Melanie's leadership, to negotiate with S&P and get a favorable upgrade. But what was really important here is more financial flexibility. And as many of you have asked over, both in our private sessions, but also on some of the calls, we've always wanted to have more financial flexibility as it relates to debt. And no surprise to everybody debts are cheapest source of capital. And as a result, you will see us continue to focus on refinancing the debt and then also using debt where appropriate, with some balance to equity, to make sure that we create this long-term investment portfolio that we've announced, from our perspective, I just think it was the best of all situations today that not only getting that upgrade, but also having the flexibility to drive down our cost of capital. Yes, So Michael, I think there are a couple things. One, when we do the charts, the charts that we've shared in the earnings deck with everybody, we really try to simplify it. There are two aspects to it. One is what is - how are the underlying business performance and its $40 million and uplift. The second part is what currency and based on the forecast rates that we're using it's 61 million down graph. But frankly, if I took the spot rates from today, which we don't do the day off, we also we have forecast rates, that $61 million would more would be cut in half, if not by more, just to give you a perspective. Having said all that, when you look at the fundamental underlying business, it's all about the rounding again, what we've done is we've taken a step up, added $40 million of revenue on $6 billion business. And now you're starting to see us move up into the range in the 7% to 8% range. So before the bottom end of the range, it was slightly below 7%. Now, you're basically you're in - you're well into the range on the 7% to 8%. Again, this is the first step that we've made since the Q4 earnings call, again, there's momentum in the business, and we're just delighted by the ability to be able to raise $40 million on the underlying business. Yes, I mean, as it relates to our sort of our comments around the Americas business. I'm sure it wasn't lost and you was right to look at our comment that the Americas business for the next three quarters, it's going to be at our 6%, if not better, and so it gives you a sense of the Americas business, it had a record, not only a record bookings quarter, certainly on the net basis, the churn is moderate. And as a result, you're getting in Americas business continuing to perform. And so that's one aspect of it. And then the other two regions sort of down the middle there some aspect due to our prior pricing uplift in Europe sort of having the lappy through, if you will, those price increases, and some of the accounting adjustments we made last year. But the reality is that overall; the business is performing well across our platform.  And that's what excites us most, that if I was to say one specific thing it's the Americas business, we're just delighted by the momentum that we're seeing. Charles made the comment in his prepared remarks, and there's over 4,000 transactions with over 3,000 customers in the quarter. We are operating at a scale that is just so substantial. And by the way, our pipeline is exceedingly strong. And so as a combination of all that, that has given us the confidence and the visibility to raise our guidance at this juncture. And we still have three quarters to go. And by the way an Analyst Day. And if I can just add on to what Charles said there, I think the most important part is to recognize so when we do an uplift, like we said in this particular case of our CapEx spend, unfortunately, when you look at our financials, it looks like our CapEx has been elevated, but ultimately, when we get that reimbursement from the joint venture, it comes to a different line. And so it will be the sale or disposition of that construction and progress into the JV. And so basically, it's a gross up, if you will. And so that's how it gets represented, but going forward as Charles said, our objective is to do most of this work inside the JV instead of on our balance sheet. And we're working really hard and we'll probably spend some more. I anticipate we'll spend much more energy talking about this at the Analyst Day, because I think there's a really good story around that particular topic. Sure. Do you want me to take that, Charles or - Okay, thank you for the question. And sort of thanks for raising it. I think if you were to step back and say what is the overall bias to the US dollar, it's for the US dollar to get weaker. And that is something that we anticipate. Having said all of that, when we go through our exercises to forecast and reforecast like every quarter, we have to look at the prevailing rates, irrespective of what they might be in the future. And so as a company, when we on the Q4 for call, if you recall, we took on 100. And there's $106 million, if you will, when that are back from the weakening of the US dollar versus the basket of currencies that we operate in. This quarter that actually reverse when we analyze the impact avails it was $61 million headwind. But as I said in one of my other responses, that's based on our forecast rate, so we use when we read it reforecast of the year, and we've given you the guidance, how you use the spot rates of today, there basically is that $61 million would drop, actually by $45 million. So it tells you that the US Dollar weakened again. So again, we try and bring a lot of discipline to how we message. It's at the point in time, if you do the forecast; we are not projecting forward on what might happen. If it does happen, then you'll see a benefit. And you'll see that benefit primarily because roughly 60% of our revenues are earned in currencies other than the US dollar. And so when the US dollar weakens, again, recognize we do have some hedges, and they take time to burn off, then you will see uplift in revenue accordingly. So hopefully that answers your question. And let me stop there and just see if I did answer your question. Sure. Yes, Colby, as it relates to the nonrecurring, I think what you could see is that means they step up to if you think about Q4 of '20, you're at - you're starting to get to a percentage of nonrecurring revenue that could look something like that. As we said in the prepared remarks, and again, I know this quite well, because of some of the work that we're doing. And I made a reference a couple quarters back, that there are some large installations that were taking place in the first half of the year, it looks like that those will close and install in Q2, as a result, you'll see a step up, again, look, be more reflective of what you - the percent of revenue coming from nonrecurring that we saw in Q4. And then it moderate back down higher than Q1, but moderate back down more - to a more reasonable level for Q3 and Q4. So hopefully, is that helpful? I want to make sure - Yes, I'm sorry, pardon me, as it relates the xScale CapEx that is included number. No. I think that was reflected in the comments. Again, it will be specific to the market, again, when we look at the project level, and then there's a p stream for Equinix. And then the leverage that we put on the business, and overall, we're pleased with the business. And, again, we're going to spend a lot more energy talking about this in the June Analyst Day, and we will be able to break out and give you a little bit more color. I think that will make you probably more satisfied with the overall project, Dave."

            "name": "Charles Meyers",
            "content": "Thank you, Katrina. Good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We had a great start to the year delivering one of the strongest net bookings quarters in our history, fueled by strong demand across our platform, our lowest churn quarter in many years, and continued momentum in our Americas business. With the addition of the Bell Canada assets, we are now the market leader in 19 of the 26 countries in which we operate. And we are delighted to now be the market leader in retail colocation across all three regions of the world, taking the number one spot in Asia Pacific for the first time this quarter. Our bookings performance continues to highlight the consistency and scale of our go-to-market engine, executing 4,300 deals with more than 3,200 customers. We have a robust build pipeline to support this demand, including 36 major projects underway across 28 markets in 19 countries, one of our most active build years ever. We fully recognize that COVID remains a very acute issue with continued tragic impacts in key markets around the world, including India and Brazil. Our hearts go out to our colleagues and customers in those markets, and we are actively taking steps to support those communities. But as we navigate toward a post pandemic world, we believe Equinix remains uniquely well positioned. Digital Transformation continues to accelerate, and businesses across a broad range of verticals are recognizing that their infrastructure can be a key source of competitive advantage in an increasingly digital world. Demand is as strong as ever. With global IT spend expected to rebound above pre pandemic levels as enterprises increase hybrid cloud spending, and service providers build out their delivery platforms to tap into this demand. Against this backdrop, we remain focused on the clear set of priorities I outlined at the start of the year, investing in our people and culture, simplifying and scaling our business, accelerating our digital services, and expanding our global reach both through our retail footprint and our rapidly growing xScale business. While we're delighted with our business results, were also highly attuned to our responsibilities as a market leader and continue to advance a bold sustainability agenda across all dimensions of ESG. Supporting our people and strengthening our culture continue to be foundational to our strategy. And in a time where it matters more than ever, our vision remains clear. For Equinix to be a place where every employee every day can confidently say I'm safe. I belong and I matter. And for our workforce at all levels to better reflect and represent the communities in which we operate. In early April, we hosted our second annual days of understanding where 1000s of our employees around the world attended workshops to listen, learn and promote a culture of mutual understanding and inclusion as we continue to build and foster an engaged diverse workforce.  Our people show up every day inspired by our purpose, to be the platform where the world comes together, enabling the innovations that enrich our work, life and planet. As we pursue this purpose, we are also deeply committed to our role as an important component in creating digital infrastructure. We recently published our 2020 corporate sustainability highlights and I am proud that Equinix once again achieved more than 90% renewable energy coverage for our global data center footprint and received an A minus score for our CDP climate change survey, a leading environmental rating system focused on climate related transparency and action. In January, we announced alongside other providers the formation of the European Climate Neutral data center pact, committed to ensuring data centers in Europe are carbon neutral by 2030. We continue to invest significant resources in our ESG leadership, and will roll out additional global ambitions over the coming quarters in both our environmental and social initiatives. Now turning to our results, as depicted on slide 3, revenues for Q1 were $1.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA was up 10% year-over-year, and AFFO was meaningfully ahead of our expectations. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our leading interconnection franchise continues to perform well with revenues substantially outpacing colocation, growing 13% year-over-year, driven by the continued strength of Equinix Fabric. We now have over 398,000 interconnections and added more organic interconnections year-over-year than the next 10 competitors combined.  In Q1, we added an incremental 6,700 interconnections fueled by hyperscaler build outs and strong enterprise demand, offset by a slight seasonal increase in network grooming activity. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 9% quarter-over-quarter and 28% year-over-year, driven by the cloud and network segments. Equinix Fabric also saw strong growth driven by expanded use of our inter metro offering and continued diversification of n destinations. More than 2,500 customers are now on Fabric and we remain focused on driving higher attach rates for this product across our platform. We're also seeing strong customer interest in our Equinix metal offering and continue to deliver on our commitment to expand the availability and feature set of this offering enabling as a service consumption of our value proposition across 18 Global metros. On the xScale side of our business, we're accelerating our pace and continue to make meaningful progress on our ambitious plans for 2021 as rapid growth in the digital economy, drives increased demand for global cloud connectivity. With our xScale facilities hyperscale companies can add large footprint core deployments to their existing network and onramp footprints at Equinix. Enabling faster time to market and offering direct interconnection to a vibrant ecosystem with their customers and strategic partners. Our more than $3 billion program finance with the support of our JV partners will develop over 290 megawatts across our first two JVs with several more already in the works. We are broadening our reach with the first building of our Dublin five campus which is JV ready, and already 100% pre-leased to a major hyper scalar. Additionally, after quarter end, we pre-leased our entire London 11 asset. These two deals alone represent nearly 40 megawatts of capacity fully committed in advance of delivery. Now, let me cover highlights from our verticals. Please note that we updated our customer segmentation approach to better reflect industry classifications and use cases as well as combined our financial services and enterprise segments to reflect the true scale and momentum of the enterprise opportunity. Going forward, we'll report under these four key verticals. Our network vertical saw strong bookings led by the previously mentioned strength in the Americas as firms expand their capabilities and capacity for digital business and momentum begins to build for industrial 5G applications.  A meaningful part of our network vertical is resale, an indication of the momentum of our channel efforts as we work with partners to deliver more complete solutions to support enterprise digital transformation. Expansions this quarter include British Telecom, a leading telecommunications provider, optimizing network and connecting to multi cloud for their global enterprise and customers. And Elextra, one of the first Mexican cloud service providers leveraging Equinix Fabric to provide a multi-cloud product offering and SUB.CO, a leading subsea cable system development firm deploying a cable node to establish the first route between Oman and Australia. Content and digital media achieved solid bookings as indoor entertainment continues to drive activity in the social media, gaming and streaming platforms. Expansions included marquee wins like Roblox expanding across platform Equinix to support the rapidly growing user base and big data requirements, as well as a global edge cloud provider expanding capacity and deploying network nodes to support accelerating demand for video content. Our cloud and IT vertical delivered strong bookings led by hyperscalers, continuing their global growth, and is worth noting that these bookings results do not include the previously referenced xScale wins, which are additive to this strong retail performance. Q1 was also an exceptional quarter in terms of cloud on ramp additions, with 21 new on ramp wins in the quarter, roughly equivalent to our cumulative volume over the prior four quarters and representing a 75% share of on ramps launched in our metros. As a result, Equinix customers can now enjoy low latency access to multiple clouds in 31 metros across the globe, including eight of the world's top 10 metros by GDP. Expansion this quarter included a fortune 30 software provider deploying infrastructure to support digital transformation and IT initiatives and Everest and Australian cloud services provider specializing in healthcare, expanding to meet country specific data compliance requirements and improve user experience. Our enterprise vertical continued to be a major contributor to overall booking performance, driven by strength in the retail and financial services sub segments, as enterprises shift from pandemic initiatives such as work from home and collaboration to a broader focus on digital transformation. Expansions included CME Group, a top global financial derivatives exchange, expanding their footprint to support growing demand of matching engines resulting from a new platform launch, as well as a leading global airline re-architecting to connect to their preferred network and cloud partners and tap into our growing transportation ecosystem. And our channel program continues to deliver exceptional results, contributing more than 30% of our bookings and accounting for over 60% of our new logos. We had great wins with resellers and our alliance partners including AT&T, Dell and IBM across a wide range of industry segments focused on digital transformation efforts and COVID-19 response. Partner wins included working with Verizon, utilizing their network as a service strategy to help a large US healthcare provider modernize their mission critical contact center, and leverage a new cloud architecture supporting 12 million members across the US, as well as a win with a global Canadian manufacturer deploying in Canada and Germany for WAN optimization and cloud access, utilizing Cisco's SD-WAN solution interconnected to Equinix Fabric. Now let me turn the call over Keith and cover the results for the quarter. Thanks, Keith. In closing, we had a terrific start to the year. As evidenced by our results, the demand backdrop for digital transformation remains strong. And I'm very pleased with our Q1 execution and the continued progress against our key areas of focus. As the world's digital infrastructure company, we are supporting service providers of every size and shape to build out their infrastructure of the digital edge, infrastructure that is more global, more distributed and more cloud connected than ever before. And together, we're leveraging the power of our platform to cultivate scaled digital ecosystems, enabling our enterprise customers to access all the right places, all the right partners and all the right possibilities, as they transform their businesses and seek to accelerate their digital advantage. On behalf of the 13,000 plus dedicated members of the Equinix family around the world, I want to say thank you to our 10,000 customers for the trust they place in Equinix. Finally, we look forward to our Analysts Day in June, where we'll continue to the discussion of our highly differentiated business model, outlined the enormous opportunity ahead and discuss the actions we are taking and the investments we are making to drive sustained, long-term value creation for our investors and our customers. So let me stop there and open it up for questions. Sure, Ari. Yes, obviously a great quarter on churn, really, as you said in the script, one of the best we've had in a number of years. And, probably a little bit of timing there. We were - we had some kind of pull forward. And we probably pushed a little bit out, but I would say that I think that we are, we continue to believe and as we've talked about this many times that the best, our best way of managing churn is to continue to be really disciplined in our targeting and our execution of the go-to- market engine. And I think that we're seeing that. The mix of business continues to be right on the money for what we want, I think we're selling a lot of business into that the sweet spot of sort of small to mid-size, interconnection heavy applications and use cases. And again, I think that's going to bode well for us over time. So I mentioned this in several other forums, which is we have been the last two quarters up towards the high end of the range, and even slightly over run in q4. But now down right at the bottom of the range. And I think we're really seeing positive trending on the churn. So and we have efforts underway to really identify all of the really project out and look at churn, churn risk in the business in a very sophisticated way, identify and get ahead of it. And I think we're seeing real dividends from that. Yes, I mean, I think that we're - our new logo additions continue to be strong, we had good momentum in new logos through the course of 2020. Q1 is a little bit of a seasonally soft quarter for new logo additions, typically, but we saw good results, I think enterprise demand continues to be very strong, our aggregate customer count is not going up as fast as our new logos, due to a variety of factors, including the fact that we are seeing some consolidation activity at the parent account level, we see some other movement in terms of people leaving the system either due to smaller, some smaller customers that might be leaving the system due to financial constraints or other things. But I would say overall we were seeing good, healthy new logo ads. And I think we're - we expect continuing to see the new customer count grow. Sure. Jonathan, why don't I start with a little bit of color on xScale at a macro level? And then Keith, if you want to jump in and share a little bit more on the fee streams and their impact in flow through into the business, that'd be great. And then we'll pick up the second question. But look, we're delighted with and the efforts of Krupal, and the xScale team and in the group of people supporting them from within the core Equinix, as well as the support we're getting from our partner at GIC, is things are really humming in terms of the xScale business. Obviously, we talked about the fact that we've had great pre-leasing activity on the facilities that we put out there, I think there is an opportunity for us to increase the pace, and we're going to come back to the Analyst Day, and really talk about kind of what we would see as the scope of opportunity for xScale going forward. As you'll recall, we talked about that in 2018, at the Analyst Day. And I think that we were - we certainly, I've said in a number of other forums, that we're trending more towards the high end of that. And I think we'll give more clarity on what's possible, we think in the xScale, business, but we're targeting the pieces of the pie out there that we think are really strategically important and add to the overall platform value. And again, we're seeing really good momentum in the business right now. I do think there's an opportunity for us to continue to pick up the pace. So Keith why don't you comment on the fee streams and impact in the fall through. Keith, why don't you pick up the lease renewals as well, and just what the opportunity might be for us to continue to increase ownership. And mix a business was really good in the quarter two in terms of strong MRR performance, which always helps the margin. So, yes, really good quarter, we are continuing to invest. We're being disciplined about the pace of that. But and we obviously were pleased with the margin performance, and we do have an eye on margin expansion as a priority for us over time. Keith, do you want to take that? Sure. Well, Keith, why don't you go ahead and grab the revenue guide, and we can a pair up on the XScale follow up? Yes, and then on the XScale piece, Mike, yes, we are kind of leaning in, and moving projects forward, even advance of those being into the JV structure, because we think the market opportunity kind of is there to grab. And, as Keith said in his script that there's a couple 100 million dollars there, we would expect to come out of that and sort of macro guide he gave overall, which would come in the form of reimbursement once those facilities move into the JV. And so that's something that we -- and but I would say that we our preference obviously, is for projects to be into the JV from the beginning. And I think we're now at a point where many of the projects will be able to do that with, but especially in markets where we are looking to either form new JVs or due to other circumstances, we are leaning in taking advantage of the strength of our balance sheet to move those things forward. But then looking to get, obviously, those things get reimbursed and come back to us, given that we're, again, our capital commitment into those projects is basically, one year that sort of a 10 to 1 ratio, since we're 20% owners, and we expect leverage on those projects. You bet, yes, all yours. Yes, we I mean, honestly, we hadn't really experienced that other than I think in the very acute periods of COVID, where people were trying to sort of just figure out how to make the transition to work from home and really dealing with matters of survival. We did not see any sort of extension significant extension of the selling cycle, in fact, I would say that, I think what we're finding is that we're improving our skill set and capability of delivering the sort of the digital transformation-oriented messaging to our enterprise prospects and seeing good momentum in terms of bringing those sales cycle down. And so, yes, we haven't seen that hyperscale sales cycles are a little longer, but I wouldn't say they have protracted, in fact, I think we've made really good progress with several of our key hyperscale customers, trying to define more repeatable terms that we can do business under, which is compressing the timeframe in which we can get deals done. And it's been - that's been an important priority for us and one that we have really put a lot of energy into late and it's really important to our partners and customers. So I would say no, I feel good about sales cycle right now. In fact, I think when we're looking at our funnel, we are seeing a very deep funnel and we're feeling like conversion rates and conversion timing, support optimism about the remainder of the year, which is all kind of reflected in our guidance. Keith why don't you talk about the Q2 revenue range, and MRR and then the xScale CapEx? And I'll pick up that last piece on the Analyst Day focus. And then on the xScale, CapEx, Keith. Yes, I mean, I would say that we did mention that and as Keith said, I think that our overall return profile continues to look very attractive in terms of what we think post fees and post leverage the kinds of returns that we're going to be getting on those projects. Although, as he also said, it is a wide range depending on individual projects and individual sort of market circumstances, because I do think there are markets where we've seen that, because I think Keith quoted 8 to 12 is the sort of yields that we're looking at in terms of a range, and there are markets that are certainly at the low end of that, where due to a variety of circumstances, and just the overall competitive nature of the market. But I think in terms of, I think we we're very pleased with the nature of our relationship with GIC, we think that we can continue to extend that and have other JVs of similar ilk around the world, under very favorable set of terms, we find ourselves to be very attractive partner, and based on the engagement that we've had, as we've looked at these JVs. And so we expect, we're going to be able to get very favorable terms for those partnerships, and having them be very much a win-win. So, Keith, I don't know if you want to add anything on that last topic relative to the cap rates. Sure, I'll comment and Keith if you want to add, feel free. We again, we have always believed and we've been quite successful using M&A as a tool in terms of thinking about how to expand our business and create value for our customers and for our shareholders. That hasn't changed; we continue to believe that there are opportunities out there. I would say that probably more of them are aligned around in the private markets. And we've clearly been active in that regard filling out our platform geographically, and adding key scale in locations in some of our markets around the world. But we're not going to be if we felt like there were transactions that we think were highly strategic, and we're the right economics in terms of how they deal with flow through an accretion basis that we're going to be open to those things. But I'd say there's probably a little bias we're in right now more towards private opportunities and greater opportunities in the private markets, but we're going to always be have our eyes wide open. Yes, I mean, when we formulated the xScale entity and approach, we talked about a range of players there that would be that we would pursue relationships with and pursue business with. It is to some degree concentrated, I think that's just that's the nature of the hyperscaler community today, is that they the largest end of that is taking up more of the overall demand, or providing more of the overall demand. So it's concentrated at some level, but we have had significant success beyond sort of the three or four that would pop to mind for people right off the top of their head. And so, I think we're going to continue to evaluate those opportunities. But I and I would say that we're really continuing to build on a strong relationship we've had with that full hyperscale community for a very long time, because as I talked about with our - when I characterize our hyperscale relationships at the Analyst Day in 2018, we - they are amongst our largest customers, many of them, and that is a lot of it on the backs of really the important role that we play in terms of their network nodes, their on ramps, and other elements of their infrastructure, outside of sort of availability zones, and really large core deployments that might be more of the focus for xScale. So it's a very multifaceted relationship that we have with them. They're critical, we believe that as people drop adopt hybrid in multi cloud as the architecture of choice, we think doing that at Equinix is really going to be a priority for them in terms of both superior economics and performance. And so their relationships that we have with the xScale, with the hyper scalars are very important to us, and certainly too some degree concentrated from a demand basis, but we're continuing to strive to extend that to larger portfolio customers. Yes, I would say no, not really. I mean, I think we continue to feel very good about our overall competitive position in Europe, as I said Interaction is, has always been a very critical, credible pan European player there and I think that continues to be the case. But we have, what we think is a much stronger global story. And I've had great success in the market and am going to continue to build on that success and we feel good about our position there."

Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. We had a great finish to 2022, delivering one of the best bookings performances in our history, led by the Americas with continued strength in demand and favorable pricing trends across all three regions. For the full year, we delivered more than $7 billion in revenue for the first time and completed our 80th consecutive quarter of revenue growth, an amazing 20 years of continuous growth, all while driving AFFO per share performance above the top end of our long-term expectations. As we look to the year ahead, even amidst a dynamic and complex global landscape, it's increasingly clear that the secular tailwinds of digital transformation remain strong. In 2023, IDC estimates spending on digital technology by organizations will grow 8x faster than the broader economy. In the current macroeconomic environment, we believe spending on digital transformation will remain robust for two simple reasons. First, as companies work harder for each incremental revenue dollar, digital is seen as a critical driver of competitive differentiation, accelerating time to market and enabling product set evolution. And second, digital transformation is increasingly a means to do more with less, enabling businesses to reduce costs and drive operating leverage while simultaneously becoming more agile and responsive in serving their customers. In the context of this secular demand environment, we remain confident that Platform Equinix is uniquely positioned to support our customers' digital infrastructure needs. Digital leaders are demanding infrastructure that is more distributed, more ecosystem-powered, more flexible and more interconnected because it is fundamental to their ability to differentiate in the marketplace and lower their costs. Our market-leading global reach, vibrant digital ecosystems and comprehensive interconnection platform allow our customers to scale with agility, speed to launch of digital services, deliver world-class experiences and enhance value to all their stakeholders. While we will continue to closely monitor the macro environment and we'll adapt our execution accordingly, the fundamentals of our business remain strong, and we're investing behind the momentum we're seeing, including adding quota-bearing heads, evolving our product set and expanding our industry-leading data center portfolio. With regards to power, our multiyear hedging efforts continue to create visibility and predictability for Equinix and our customers in the coming year. Effective January 1, we raised pricing, passing on the full impact of these additional power costs to our customers, increasing costs but giving our customers much needed budget certainty and, in most cases, leaving them with rates below the prevailing spot market. Overall, we believe we remain in a good position relative to competitors and the broader market, and I'm pleased with where we landed for our customers and our business. Turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for the full year were $7.3 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 8% year-over-year and AFFO per share grew 11% year-over-year. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our data center services portfolio continues to extend its scale and reach. And given strong demand and high utilization, we see continued opportunity to deliver highly attractive returns on capital, as evidenced by the largest development pipeline in our history. We currently have 49 major projects underway across 35 metros in 23 countries, including nine xScale projects representing over 34,000 cabinets of retail and over 75 megawatts of xScale capacity. New projects this quarter include new data center builds in Istanbul, Seoul and Tokyo, and our first builds in both Johannesburg, South Africa and Johor, Malaysia. Our new IBX in Johannesburg augments our current footprint in Africa, entering the largest and most digitally developed nation on the continent. And our new IBX in Johor represents our entry into one of the most requested markets in Asia Pacific by our global customers. Equinix remains the best manifestation of the interconnected digital edge. And with these new builds, our unparalleled global footprint will span 75 metros and 35 countries. The strength of our global platform continues to shine, with nearly 90% of our revenue coming from customers operating in multiple metros and nearly 2/3 coming from customers operating in all three regions. Key multi-market wins this quarter included one of the world's leading hospitality companies, finding performance gains at the edge by deploying in strategic markets across all three regions; and a leading cloud and CDN provider extending coverage and scaling globally to support new services and meet growing demand. IDC estimates that more than 750 million cloud-native applications will be developed globally by 2025. And as this digital transformation wave continues, customers see Equinix as the logical point of nexus for hybrid and multi-cloud deployments. This quarter, we won four new cloud on-ramps, including one in Mumbai, making it the 12th metro on Platform Equinix enabled with native cloud on-ramps from all five of the leading cloud providers. No other data center operator has more than one metro with all five clouds. In our xScale business, we continue to see strong overall demand, leasing approximately 8 megawatts of capacity across our Tokyo 12 and Osaka two assets with meaningful expansions in our forward pipeline. Enterprise wins leveraging the cloud this quarter include a global technology company in the payments industry, deploying infrastructure to place their corporate and customer networks closer to AWS and Azure; and a leading paints and coatings company choosing Equinix for its cloud on-ramp capabilities and virtualized service offerings. Our industry-leading interconnection franchise continues to perform well with revenues for the quarter growing 13% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, outpacing the broader business. We now have over 446,000 total interconnections on our platform. In Q4, we added an incremental 4,500 organic interconnections, slightly lower than our historical run rate due to seasonally slower gross adds, customer consolidations into higher bandwidth BCs on fabric and some elevated grooming activity. Equinix Fabric saw continued growth and is now operating at a $200 million revenue run rate, one of our fastest-growing products. Attach rates for Fabric continue to move higher with 40% of customers realizing the benefits of connecting their digital infrastructure at software speed. Internet exchange saw peak traffic jump 7% quarter-over-quarter and 28% year-over-year to greater than 29 terabits per second, driven by FIFA World Cup streaming demand and reflecting the continued strategic importance of having the world's largest Internet exchange footprint on Platform Equinix. Key interconnection wins this quarter included one of Korea's largest conglomerates, establishing interconnection in Seoul for SJC2, the Southeast Asia-Japan Cable, which will be ready for service this year, and the largest water authority in the Netherlands, implementing Equinix Fabric to directly and securely connect to distributed infrastructure and digital ecosystems to ensure a clean water supply. Turning to our digital services portfolio, we saw continued momentum with Equinix Metal and Network Edge, driving attractive pull-through to Fabric. Digital services wins this quarter included a leading insurance and financial services company evolving their internal systems from their own data center to a public cloud plus Metal approach at Equinix; and a Belgian advertising service provider using Equinix Metal for fast, efficient, reliable data movement to support localized online advertising. And our channel program delivered its seventh consecutive record quarter, accounting for nearly 40% of bookings and nearly 60% of new logos. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and digital first-use cases with hybrid multi-cloud as the clear architecture of choice. We saw continued strength from partners like AT&T, Avant, Cisco, HPE and Microsoft. Key wins included delivering a critical time-sensitive site migration for a multinational banking and financial services client in partnership with Options IT and Dell, leveraging a combination of Equinix Metal, Network Edge and Fabric to overcome supply chain delays and ensure continuity of operations while interconnecting to critical trading platforms. So let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results from the quarter.\nKeith Taylor: Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. To start, we had a great end to the year, finishing Q4 with healthy bookings, strong pricing, which included a nice uplift in MRR per cabinet in each of our regions and a solid forward-looking demand pipeline. We closed over 17,000 deals across more than 6,000 customers in 2022, and no single customer represents more than 3% of our MRR, highlighting the tremendous scale, reach and diversity of our go-to-market engine that continues to produce despite volatile and shifting macro conditions. Given the weaker U.S. dollar relative to our prior guidance rates, FX has shifted from a meaningful headwind to a tailwind, which is positive, although 2023 exchange rates still remain below the average FX rates for 2022. And while we continue to remain vigilant to the challenges in the broader economy, we do remain optimistic about our business and the key demand drivers and feel we're very well positioned to grow and scale due to our industry-leading risk management efforts across procurement and strategic sourcing, power and treasury and our future-first sustainability program. Also, the diversity and mix of our customers is benefiting us, with large established businesses constituting a majority of our revenues has greater than 80% of our recurring revenues come from companies generating $100 million or more in annual revenues. And more than 85% of our recurring revenues in the quarter come from customers deployed in three or more data centers, making Equinix a core vendor for our customers' digital infrastructure needs. Equinix remains in excellent financial health with strong liquidity positions, low net leverage, allowing us to be both strategically and operationally flexible in this current market environment. Now as part of our larger programmatic approach to managing power costs, we initiated efforts to enhance our customer communications last fall, providing our customers insights into our efforts while continuing to protect our customers and ourselves against the rising costs through our multiyear hedging efforts. At the start of 2023, we raised our power prices primarily in the EMEA region to recover these rising costs. While power markets remain volatile, our hedging approach meaningfully dampened the impact of the inflated energy costs for many of our customers. We expect these power price increases will generate approximately $350 million of incremental revenues and costs in 2023. And as a result, the cumulative power price increases are expected to increase our revenue growth by approximately 500 basis points. Now despite these increases, our cost management efforts have protected both our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO on a dollar basis, but as expected, have negatively impacted our adjusted EBITDA margins for the year. We expect these higher energy costs to be transitory and should reverse course over our future yet-to-be-determined period, at which time both our gross profit and adjusted EBITDA margins will return to our targeted and expected levels. Now let me cover the highlights for the quarter. Note that all comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q4 revenues were $1.871 billion, up 11% over the same quarter last year, above the midpoint of our guidance range on an FX-neutral basis, largely due to strong recurring revenues led by the Americas region. We continue to enjoy net positive pricing actions in the quarter. And similar to prior quarter, price increases outpaced price decreases by a ratio of 3:1. Q4 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included an $8 million tailwind when compared to our prior guidance rates due to the weaker U.S. dollar in the quarter. As we look forward, we expect a significant step-up in Q1 recurring revenues, largely due to strong net bookings performance and significant power price increases. Global Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $839 million or 45% of revenues, up 7% over the same quarter last year, at the top end of our guidance range due to strong operating performance. Q4 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges included a $1 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates and $7 million of integration costs. Global Q4 AFFO was $658 million, above our expectations due to strong operating performance, including seasonally higher recurring CapEx and included an $11 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q4 MRR churn was 2.2%, a derivative of disciplined sales execution, whereby we put the right customer with the right application into the right asset. For the year, MRR churn was better than expected with the average quarterly MRR churn at the low end of our guidance range. As we look forward into 2023, we expect MRR churn to remain comfortably within our targeted 2% to 2.5% per quarter range. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC was the fastest revenue-growing region on a year-over-year normalized basis at 17%, followed by the Americas and EMEA regions at 10% and 9%, respectively. The Americas region had another quarter of strong gross bookings, lower MRR churn and continued favorable pricing trends led by our New York, Toronto and Washington, D.C. metros. The strength in the region remains broad-based, and the acquired Antel assets in Chile and Peru have performed better than we planned. Our EMEA region delivered a strong quarter with continued healthy pricing trends and an attractive retail mix as well as record inter- 40 new logos in 2022, and we're already seeing customer interest for our Jakarta and Johor sites. And now looking at the capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our balance sheet increased slightly to greater than $30 billion, including an unrestricted cash balance of $1.9 billion. As expected, our quarter-over-quarter cash balance decreased due to the significant planned increase in growth CapEx and real estate purchases and our quarterly cash dividend. I said previously, we plan to take a balanced and opportunistic approach to accessing the capital markets when conditions are favorable. As such, we're happy to share that we recently priced a Japanese yen private placement, raising the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $600 million of debt with an average duration of greater than 14 years and a blended cost to borrow an attractive 2.2%. This transaction is expected to fund in Q1. We also executed some ATM forward sale transactions in Q4, providing $300 million of incremental equity funding when settled. Pro forma for these transactions, we have nearly $7 billion of readily available liquidity and remain very well funded to meet our ongoing cash needs. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $828 million, including recurring CapEx of $80 million. In the quarter, we opened six retail projects in Geneva, Los Angeles, Osaka, Singapore, Washington, D.C. and Zurich and three xScale projects in Dublin, Sao Paulo and Osaka. We also purchased our Geneva two and Sao Paulo four IBX assets as well as land for development in London. Revenues from owned assets increased to 63% of our recurring revenues for the quarter. Our capital investments delivered strong returns, as shown on Slide 10. Our now 158 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 87% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. As a reminder, similar to prior years, we plan to update our stabilized asset summary on the Q1 earnings call. And finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 of our summary of 2023 guidance and bridges. Do note, all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. Starting with revenues, for 2023, we expect top line revenues will step up by nearly $1 billion, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 14% to 15%. Excluding our power price pass-throughs, we expect top line revenue growth to range between 9% and 10%, above the top end of our long-term growth rates, as highlighted at our 2021 Analyst Day, reflecting the continued momentum in the business. We expect 2023 adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 45%, excluding integration costs. And excluding the impact of power price increases to revenues and higher utility costs, adjusted EBITDA margins would approximate 48%, the result of strong operating leverage and efficiency initiatives. We expect to incur $35 million of integration costs in 2023. 2023 AFFO is expected to grow between 9% and 12% compared to the previous year, and AFFO per share is expected to grow 8% to 10% at the top end of our long-term range from our 2021 Analyst Day. 2023 CapEx is expected to range between $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, including approximately $150 million of on-balance sheet xScale spend, which we expect to be reimbursed as we transfer assets into the joint ventures and about $205 million of recurring CapEx spend. And finally, we're increasing the annual growth rate of our cash dividend on a per share basis to 10% due to strong operating performance. The cash dividend will approximate $1.3 billion, a 12% year-over-year increase, 100% of which is expected to be attributed to operating performance. So let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thanks, Keith. Our record of strong and consistent operating performance continued in 2022, and I'm proud of how the team delivered value for our customers and our shareholders. In 2023 and beyond, we believe the opportunity for our business remains significant as enterprises and service providers alike look to Platform Equinix as their key digital infrastructure partner to advance their digital transformation agenda. To expand our market leadership, reinforce our competitive advantage and drive sustained value creation, the leadership team and I have outlined a clear set of priorities for the coming year. First, we intend to press our advantage in our interconnected colo franchise, continuing to scale and evolve our best-in-class bookings engine, delivering on key projects to enhance operating leverage, further extending our superior global reach, refining processes and systems to enhance the Equinix experience for our customers and partners, and integrating our sustainability leadership into our services in ways that better help our customers meet their commitments to environmental and social responsibility. Second, we intend to continue to enrich our platform value proposition by accelerating our digital services growth, delivering a more unified set of platform capabilities and by investing in ecosystem enablement, empowering key partners to bring their value to our platform more quickly and easily and allowing us to leverage their significant go-to-market reach. And we will advance these priorities by continuing to cultivate a culture that remains firmly people-first. We're committed to making Equinix a place that attracts, inspires and develops the best talent in our industry, cultivating an in-service-to mindset and creating a place where every person every day can say, \"I'm safe, I belong and I matter.\" In closing, our business remains well positioned. Despite a challenging macroeconomic and sociopolitical environment, digital transformation remains a clear priority across all industries and digital leaders will continue to harness our trusted platform to bring together and interconnect the foundational infrastructure that powers their success. In that vein, we're pleased to welcome Tom Olinger to our Board of Directors. As the longtime CFO at Prologis, Tom has extensive international operating experience spanning real estate and technology, which will benefit our business. I'd also like to thank Budd Lyons for his exceptional service and contributions to the growth and success of the Company over the past 15 years as he rotates off the Board. So let me stop there and open it up for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimon Flannery: I wonder -- it's good to hear the strong outlook for 2023 and the good commentary around current activity. Can you square that for us with some of the comments from Amazon and Microsoft and others about enterprises becoming more cautious in December and through the early part of the first quarter? You did talk a little bit about some grooming, I think, in interconnect, but I understand the core value proposition. But are you seeing any of that behavior? And what gives you the confidence that, that's not going to be of a concern through some of your enterprise or other customers who are facing some challenges in this macro environment? And then the second one on the pricing. Good to see the color, the detail around that. Has that -- have you been able to successfully get the payments? Has there been any pushback from the customers around that or people who have a struggle to pay those increases? Any color on that would be great as you go through the first couple of billing cycles here.\nCharles Meyers: Sure. Thanks, Simon. Yes, both questions, we fully expected would be there. In terms of the overall macro environment, I would say, I think that the discussion has been interesting in terms of the cloud providers talking about customers being a bit more cautious. I think in specifics around customers who have really significantly expanded their investment in cloud and the workloads they're moving to cloud, et cetera, and many of whom I think have said, \"Wow, cloud -- our cloud bill has gone crazy on us, and we really need to step back and take a look at that.\" I do think that we see some of that dynamic. We actually see that dynamic, to some degree, playing in our favor in that customers are actually, one, sort of saying, \"Hey, what are -- it's not blindly sort of everything to cloud. It is really what is the appropriate mix of infrastructure requirements and how are we going to use the various clouds and how we're going to do that effectively? And how are we going to have the agility to move things between clouds?\" And so, I think we've seen customers really, one, very committed to their digital transformation agenda; two, I do think that they -- even though they have that commitment, it's probably in the context of a sort of a broader belt-tightening environment for overall budgets. And so, I do think they're being appropriately cautious about their investments. I think that they are -- we're seeing that they are -- I heard one CEO characterize it as measure twice, cut once in terms of how customers are thinking about their investments. But we definitely see them leaning in on digital overall. And I would say that we -- even in the cloud space, the amount of adds that are going in and the incremental revenue that the cloud providers are adding is still absolutely staggering. And in terms of overall quantum, it's quite consistent. It's coming down because the growth rates are coming down because you're on a very huge base. But overall, I think people still very committed to hybrid and multi-cloud as their architecture of choice. And I think they're really viewing Equinix as a key partner in figuring out how to appropriately manage and efficiently manage infrastructure costs going forward. So while we are seeing, I think, and people being appropriately cautious in a macro environment that would dictate that, we're still quite optimistic about the overall demand profile in our pipeline. And our conversion rates continue to sort of make us feel confident in that. And then the second one, relative to the power pass-through, we feel very good. We've got -- we've communicated that out to customers. We've had a lot of inquiries. Most of those inquiries are simply about explaining and providing them additional information on the charges. And so to this point, we feel very confident that we're -- continue to feel very confident we're going to get full recovery of that. And we'll continue to update you as we learn more. But right now, all systems go.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJon Atkin: So maybe looking a little bit at the revenue growth guidance, if you could unpack -- you talked about the energy price increases. But apart from that, cabinet growth versus cross-connect growth and various flavors of digital services. Can you talk a little bit about what you're expecting for 2023?\nCharles Meyers: Sure. Yes. Again, we're very excited. As evident in the guide, we continue to feel very optimistic about the top line of the business. Obviously, it's a bit elevated with the power price pass-through. But even on an adjusted basis, excluding that 9% to 10%, which is above the long-term guide that we had provided at the Analyst Day. So, I think it reflects the overall strength in the business. And we're seeing really across-the-board strength. I think in colo and interconnection, in digital services and really across the regions. And we're seeing a combination of solid volume and very strong pricing. And so, I definitely think pricing is going to continue to contribute, and that is separate and apart from the power price increase. Even if you take that 9% to 10%, I think us increasing list pricing, which I think in sort of an inflationary environment, we have to demonstrate that we can do that. And I think we're having good success with that. So, I think the colo business remains strong, unit volumes on colo interconnection growing at 13%. Again, we saw slightly softer unit adds there, but I think we feel like that will probably normalize through the course of the year. And then digital services, we came off a really strong quarter. 2022 was really, I think, the front end of an inflection point of really, people saying, this is a great way for us to think about how to really use the power of the interconnected edge at Equinix in new ways. And so, I think we're going to see great strength there. The Americas business performed -- '22 is just an amazing year for the Americas business. I think EMEA really demonstrated some strength coming off the back end of the interconnection price increases and continuing to really evolve that portfolio to the retail suite. And then Asia is our fastest-growing region at 17%. So again, I feel very good that we've got pretty comprehensive strength in volume and in price across products and across geographies.\nJon Atkin: So just by way of follow-up and what you're expecting in terms of customer decision cycle this year, book-to-bill intervals in your core business, it sounds like no change. I just wanted to kind of verify that. And then turning to xScale briefly, if you could maybe comment on pricing in the wholesale segment, and how is that keeping pace with higher build costs and higher financing costs?\nCharles Meyers: Sure, yes. Generally, I think that the book-to-bill, we have not seen any extensions of book-to-bill. I think in terms of quote to book, in other words, what's the sales cycle, I think we're seeing some anecdotal evidence of this sort of measure twice, cut once. But again, the team has -- is seeing strong conversion rates, solid pipeline and continue to feel good overall. So haven't seen any material change, although again, anecdotal evidence that you're seeing a little just caution in terms of customers really making sure that they're buying exactly what they need in the right amounts. And that's not surprising in sort of the macro kind of environment that we have. And then, Keith, I don't know if you have any further comment on book-to-bill and then xScale.\nKeith Taylor: Yes. The only other thing I would say in book-to-bill, last year, there were some supply chain constraints. We don't foresee any meaningful amount of that this year as it relates to the installation of our customers, so continue to be optimistic about that. And as it relates to xScale, I was just saying in the prepared remarks, you can see that there's a tremendous amount of capacity that we're building across our xScale sort of portfolio. And it's exciting. And so as that relates to not only the opportunity, and not counter to Simon's maybe worried bit, we're seeing the -- a lot of volume opportunities sitting inside the xScale business. So that's good. And then from a price point, no surprise, costs have moved up and pricing, therefore, has moved up to recover that cost and get the appropriate returns. So, I feel good from both perspectives. One, there's the volume that's there. There's the activity that we're building to support that volume, and we're getting the price points and the returns that we feel are appropriate for this juncture.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nFrank Louthan: Can you walk us through a little bit of the difference between sort of what's the pass-through from the revenue side, from the power increases versus what flowed through from the price hikes that you put in this year? And what had the biggest impact from the price increases? Was it more the base rents or the cross-connects? How would you characterize that?\nCharles Meyers: Sure, yes. I mean, the power pass-through is a really easy one to think through. It's on the order of $350 million on the revenue line and on the expense line. So -- and it's just -- and that's really what causes the 500 bp increase on the revenue line, obviously, without corresponding flow through to EBITDA. And so that impacts the EBITDA margin. But on a normalized basis, so as reported 45% guide but a normalized or excluding that 48%, which we think continues to look very good. And so -- and in terms of power price increases on the rest of the portfolio, I think we're seeing it -- we're going kind of across the board in space, power as well as in the digital services, making adjustments that we think are appropriate in the market. And part of that is just reflecting the increasing expense environment and some of the costs inside of the business that are going up. But then part of that is also just, I think, a really strong reflection of the value we deliver to the customer. And so, I think you're going to -- you're seeing the growth is certainly partially driven by strong pricing, and that's pretty consistent across the space, power and interconnect.\nKeith Taylor: And Frank, let me just maybe add on to what Charles said there. As we think about our business, and I said this at the Analyst Day two years ago and we'll certainly update you in the June Analyst Day coming, but when you think about pricing, historically, it was running at about 6% of our bookings. And we've said that price increases are in the range of 3% to 5% and our stabilized revenue -- our stabilized assets are growing at recurring revenue at 6% right now. So, I think you're going to get it from a number of different spots: number one, inflation. You've got the inflationary impact, and of course, that is going to move the pricing up higher than where we historically have been. And Charles was also alluding to the fact we also are moving list pricing. And so, when you look at list pricing, plus you've got the inflationary increases and then you've got the PPIs in addition to adding what we think is great value across our set of products and services, you have a broader influence coming from not just -- you have quantity but you have price. And I think that's something that we'll continue to sort of track and update you on as we come to the June Analyst Day, as I said.\nFrank Louthan: And can you remind me what your average contract length is?\nKeith Taylor: Two to three years.\nFrank Louthan: Remaining, two to three years.\nKeith Taylor: Inside the retail business. xScale, of course, is longer than that.\nFrank Louthan: What's the average kind of outstanding at any -- currently?\nKeith Taylor: In xScale or in retail?\nFrank Louthan: Just in retail?\nKeith Taylor: Yes, the average is two to three. Again, I don't have any more refined than that. That just gives you an indication of how things will renew. And as a result, one of the things I said at least in my prepared remarks is when you look at price increases relative to price decreases, we always talk about net positive pricing actions and you've heard us mention that quarter after quarter for years. It's a reflection that it's a living and breathing organism. And that there's always going to be movement and you're renegotiating with your customers. And some people, you'll adjust down, but the bias is towards price increases, not only because that's how the model works, but you're really going to see that come through as again, you feel the inflationary impacts, you go through the power price increases, and it manifests itself in our -- on a currency-adjusted MRR per cabinet number across all three regions. And that will continue to be something that we will monitor very, very closely.\nCharles Meyers: Yes. And Frank, I'd offer that in a sort of -- we've become very adept at sort of managing and optimizing sort of the overall return profile in the business. And as you look at the current environment, which is strong underlying demand signal, high utilization rates in some markets, particularly we have some markets that are quite tight, it really gives us the opportunity as we look at how to optimize to not only sort of in a rising rate environment, look at how to optimize that and upon renewal, either take unutilized capacity and resell it at significantly higher rates or, in some cases, look to do that proactively. And so, I do think that, that works well for us as we continue to demonstrate that we've got a level of pricing power in the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Just a couple of expense questions and then a revenue question. So on the expenses, as you close the books on 2022, if I'm looking at the slides, it looks like there was some impact both to revenue and EBITDA or expenses from the power pass-throughs you previously have discussed, Singapore. Can you share the funnel dollar amounts of impact that we should just be bouncing off of for 2023? And then as you look at 2023, are there incremental sales or product investments that we should be mindful of as we think about the types of opportunities, Charles, that you were discussing in the priorities to enrich the platform? And then I get to the final question of just, what are some of those examples maybe specifically on how you're trying to enrich the platform for 2023 and beyond?\nCharles Meyers: You want to take the first one on the PPI from '22?\nKeith Taylor: So Singapore, let me step back first. And when I talk -- when we think about Q4, which obviously is the most current guide, you see that we did slightly better than we guided to despite some of the movements. And as we sort of mentioned in the last call, we normally accelerate some costs into fourth quarter, largely for repairs and maintenance and some outside consulting work. And we expect it, our utility costs, to go up largely because of the seasonal aspect, less about the Singapore PPIs but the seasonal aspect. And part of the reason that we did a little bit better was those utility rates didn't go up as much as we anticipated. And then we've seen some moderation in price. Price and power is still inflated but moderated relative to some of our assumptions. So when you look at the fourth quarter, I would say that it performed exactly as we anticipated with a little bit of benefit attributed to power savings and really with the operating performance and then better revenues. Specifically to Singapore though, when we look at the sort of the net hit for Singapore last year, think of it in the order of magnitude of $50 million to $60 million. The reason I'm giving you a range is there was a substantial increase or a weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Singapore dollar. And so when you look at the net impact, it had a little bit of a knock-on effect on our results because obviously, you're absorbing a cost at a higher exchange rate. And so that would -- that gives you a sense of where we are in Singapore. As you then sort of fast forward to 2023, one of the things that we had mentioned in 2022 for the costs that we do not recover from Singapore in 2022 because we were out of market, market has moved to Equinix and part of the recovery that you're seeing and it's embedded in that $350 million is basically recovering cost that -- the cost increase in Singapore that we didn't recover in 2022. So it gives you a sense, there's think of, again, in the order of magnitude of $50 million to $60 million, is that number that you should be thinking about.\nCharles Meyers: And of course, the overall quantum in 2023 is much larger, as I described earlier. And so -- but that's -- but I think we're clear on that in terms of how that affects both revenue and margins.\nKeith Taylor: Does that answer your question, Mike? I want to make sure that we -- because you're asking about the P&L. I want to make sure that we hit that question for you.\nMichael Rollins: Yes. So it looked like just on the Slide 12 and Slide 13, just to dig in just for another moment just to make sure I fully appreciate the difference. So it shows the 11% constant currency without power pass-through, 10% after the power pass-through and then it shows a difference in margin as well. So is that the $50 million to $60 million? Or is there an additional amount that we should just be thinking through when making the adjustments to compare it to what's happening in 2023?\nKeith Taylor: No. I mean, it's relatively -- is consistent with what we said. I mean, part of what you're getting is a normalized versus a normalized without power pass-through. And so the difference between those two is we're saying that if -- we would have done a little bit better had we not been exposed to that Singapore exposure.\nMichael Rollins: And then just on the cost for 2023, maybe moving to that, are there any specific sales or operational investments?\nKeith Taylor: Yes, definitely. Let me give you a little color on that, Mike. So we -- the investments that we were -- and I've talked about this in a few different forums, that we're holding a pretty tight line on G&A. We are definitely investing in the go-to-market engine so that's a clear area of investment. I think we'll be approaching closer to 700 quota-bearing heads. And so we've definitely made that investment. Some of those are -- many of those were already on board at our Connect sales event -- sales kickoff event and are raring to go for the year. But we're still adding some as we speak. Product is really not an area of significant incremental investment, but we are adapting sort of exactly how we're spending our product level investments. Scott Crenshaw has come in on the digital services side, and I think we're evolving our areas of focus. We're going to continue to focus on -- we think Metal continues to have significant opportunity. Network Edge is continuing to see momentum in the market. But I think evolving Metal to be a more foundational platform for the ecosystem to bring value to our platform is something we see a lot of value in. And so, we're excited about the VMC on Equinix that partnership with VMware. And I think that's sort of more of sort of the color of things to come in terms of more investment in the ecosystem. And so, I think that's something you're going to see. And then we're also going to probably make some efficiency and continued efficiency programs that we think are going to drive long-term, either power efficiencies in terms of PUE improvement, and/or labor efficiencies in the business because we do believe that at some point down the road, we're going to have to use margin expansion as a way to drive AFFO per share growth. If you look at the current guide, it's really being driven by top line growth and then flow through, right? And so -- and we're -- but at a very healthy margin. So absent the PPI, we're at about 48% margin, a little bit of an increase, about 10 bps from where we would have been in 2022. We would have been higher than that because we are delivering operating leverage on G&A and other areas of the business. But we've reinvested it into those areas that I just described for you.\nMichael Rollins: And just finally on some examples of the ways that you'd like to enrich that platform in terms of the priorities you were sharing with us earlier in the call?\nCharles Meyers: Sure. A couple of areas, one is definitely on that ecosystem enablement side. We've got to make it easier for partners to bring their value to the platform. And so I think in terms of how we think about enabling them from the software side with APIs, richer APIs and easier -- an easier experience for customers and partners improving our portal and our software level, programmatic engagement opportunities at the API level, that's clearly going to be an area of investment. And then making the platform easier to use and more consistent. I think we -- that's one of the things we've heard from our channel partners, making it easier for them to quote and order and deliver our services, that's going to be a continued area of investment for us as well.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Barden with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Barden: I guess, Keith, you probably expect this question. But if I take your fourth quarter revenue and multiply it by four, I add the $350 million of power pass-throughs and I subtract it from the midpoint of your 2023 outlook, the math suggests that you're telling us we're going to see mid-$30 million per quarter sequential revenue growth versus what we saw in 2022, which was closer to mid-$40s million. And so, I just want to make sure I didn't mishear anything about the strength of the platform and other things that we might need to be concerned about. And then I guess my second question is, other than raising your revenue growth guidance over the course of the year, as we think about the June Analyst Day, Charles, what are you -- what kind of expectations do you want to set that we're going to hear when we get to the midyear time?\nKeith Taylor: So let me take the first question, David, and thanks for doing the math. So let me start off at the highest level. We expect to book more in 2023 than we booked on a net basis than we did in 2022. So you can see that the business is going to continue to perform at a nice clip. There's a lot of non-recurring activities that go on in the business, particularly around xScale. But I would say that xScale, in addition, we expect to do more in 2023 than we did in 2022. You've got some currency movements and some relatively meaty movements. But currency is now starting to feel like it's at our back. But as I said, 2023 rates are still below the average rates of 2022, and so you're taking a little bit of a hit. And the order of magnitude of that hit, just to give you a sense on the averages is about $160 million to the top line. So you've got a little bit going on there, but I think if you go back just to the fundamentals, all else being equal, if currencies continue to move as they had been, although we've been a little bit of a blip over the last couple of weeks, another 10% move in currencies is a substantial uplift in our revenues. And so not only would it recapture the averages that we saw in 2022, it would give you more wind at your back for 2023. And so bottom line is there's nothing fundamental. We're obviously giving you a little bit wider range, given the economic environment that we're operating in today. That was very deliberate and it's very early in the year. And so for those reasons, I say, look, that's the guide. It's got a wide range and we're planning to execute against the plan that I just mentioned.\nCharles Meyers: So in terms of the Analyst Day, I mean, I think we'll -- that will actually be progressed well into the year, and I think we'll be able to give you a continued update on momentum in a number of areas. But I think we'll also continue to give you visibility in how we're evolving, driving the evolution to a more comprehensive platform value proposition. We'll really talk about being the infrastructure platform of choice for customers as they implement hybrid and multi-cloud as the architecture of choice. And so, I think updating you on what that means for our sort of traditional interconnected colo business and what that means for expansion of the platform, continued improvement of the customer experience. And then on the digital services side, how we'll continue to evolve the platform in terms of the service offerings with probably a real focus on Metal as a foundational piece of that. And then also on cloud networking. Networking is definitely an area of value add that we have always had for our customers and I think an area that we can continue to evolve the platform in terms of how we make it easier for customers to interconnect a variety of forms of infrastructure in a very cloud-centric world. And so, I think we'll talk you through those evolutions of the strategy and update you on where we're making investments and how we see the long-term outlook playing out as a result.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nEric Luebchow: So just curious on your development pipeline, I think it's about as big as I've ever seen in terms of new expansion capacity. Maybe you can talk about, based on pretty tight industry supply, what kind of fill rates your utilization rates you expect to deliver on new development. Is it happening faster than it has in some historical periods? Then in terms of development cost inflation, have we started to see that cost curve flatten out? And do you think that, to some extent, could dictate how much your ability is to raise rents, excluding power pass-throughs as we look throughout the year?\nCharles Meyers: Yes. I mean, we're definitely seeing strong fill rates and that's informing the continued investment in the development pipeline for sure. And I would say that we're -- so that's -- I think that's -- and I think we're seeing -- we're underwriting to return profiles in light of that, that I think are very consistent with what we've seen in the past. I definitely do think, on the second part of your question, that we are -- we've seen a meaningful uptick in cost, and we are expecting and anticipating and managing toward increases in pricing to maintain a consistent return profile. And thus far, I think we're seeing that our ability to have those price increases materialize in the market, in other words, our pricing power remains strong. So I think -- and in terms of whether they're stabilizing, I do think that, as Keith said, the supply chain situation, I think, is a bit more stable, and we were, I think, due to a good strong execution on our part and our scale and some of the capabilities we have, I think we managed it quite effectively. And I think we're continuing to be diligent about that going forward. So, I think we've stabilized a lot of the risks on the supply chain side. Labor is tight still in some markets. And there, like for example, in France, where with the Olympics coming up, it's just finding the ability to advance those projects on the time lines that you want is a challenging task for sure. So, I would say the labor piece is probably the one on the supply chain that is a little bit more an area to watch for us. But overall, I think we feel very good about the underwriting, a lot of it still going into our core campuses that have sort of a really, really well-established track record of fill rate. But we're also seeing some of our newer edge markets continue to perform well ahead of expectations. So yes, big development pipeline, managing it well and I think feeling good about our ability to sort of perform to that underwriting.\nKeith Taylor: And Eric, let me just add maybe to what Charles has said. And again, in our prepared remarks, one of the things that was really important that we wanted to share with our -- the group here is the fact that we're funding the business. So, we not only have the cash on the balance sheet, we're bringing capital -- more capital on the balance sheet to fund 49 major projects that we've at least announced thus far across many metros. And we're going to be in 75 metros in not too far from now. So, you got a sense, one, the capital plan is increasing. We think we've got the supply chain well secured. We have a really good procurement team and strategic sourcing team that makes sure that we have the resources available. And then you've got a global design and construction team, they're doing just an excellent job delivering the capacity as quickly as we can deliver it. And it's tough out there in some markets. But I think it was really important to understand not only the volume there, we've got strategic planning, sourcing in place. We have the capital that we need. And we're setting ourselves up to fund all those things through 2023 and put us in a really good position as we start 2024. And so leverage is not going to shift in any meaningful way so it gives us that enhanced flexibility. And at the same time, we've all effectively prefunded a lot of the costs into the model, and we are now enjoying the benefits of this large expansion or this growth initiative that Charles has alluded to, both on the physical side and on the digital side. And so, it's the combination of all those things that really give us -- make us feel very good about our capital plan, our balance sheet and the liquidity position we're in right now.\nOperator: Thank you. And we do have time for just one more question. Our last question will come from Nick Del Deo with SVB MoffettNathanson.\nNick Del Deo: First, Charles, you noted that interconnection adds were a bit soft due to seasonality, grooming and some virtual interconnections being consolidated. I guess, can you just expand a bit more on what's specifically driving those trends, the relative importance of each one and why you feel comfortable that it's going to normalize over the course of the year? And then second, in the current environment, you've got customers more cautious about spending in general but maybe more averse to capital outlays. Do you see that as sort of a net neutral for services like Metal or net positive or net negative? And do you feel like you're educating your customers appropriately today to take advantage of them?\nCharles Meyers: Yes, great question. Starting on the interaction, look, we feel really good about the interconnection business overall growing at 13%. We're clearly being able to make adjustments to interconnection pricing alongside broader list prices, so the pricing element is strong there. As I said, we did see a little weaker -- Q4 is seasonally a bit weaker, but definitely, this Q4 is weaker than prior Q4s. And I think there is some consolidation. I think it's partially due to just, as I said, the behavior of customers for -- interconnection is probably as close to we have to a usage-based service. It was -- some of our digital services are more usage based. But in the colo environment, that's as close as we have to usage-based services. When people -- things start to get paid, people immediately look at the things they can impact the fastest. And so I think it's pretty common for them to look at the portfolio and say, do I have interconnection I'm not using or that's underutilized that I could consolidate on the higher circuits? And I think that's some of the dynamic that we're seeing. So, I'd expect to -- and then we did see a little bit of, in terms of these virtual BCs to cloud ZNs, a little lighter on gross adds, still very healthy gross adds, by the way, because the cloud -- I think cloud and workload migration continues very full tilt and despite sort of what people are saying about the reducing growth rates of their cloud business, we're still seeing that very. But it is a little bit lower in terms of gross adds than it was. And so -- but I think that we tend to see that -- those kinds of dynamics as something that's a bit of a burst of activity as people go through budget cycles and then they kind of run out of gas on their ability to sort of squeeze more out of that. And so we'll monitor it closely. I continue to feel like the bottom line is that customers really see our interconnection platform as fundamental to how they're thinking about go-forward hybrid and multi-cloud architectures. And so, I think the demand profile for the business for the interconnection over the long term is going to continue to be really strong. And then on the second part around digital services, I definitely think that we're starting to see a realization from customers and the ability of our sales teams to articulate that services like Metal and their ability to deliver more on-demand infrastructure that can help customers be more agile is something we're seeing an inflection point on. We won some very marquee deals in Q4 of last year. I think we're seeing very large service provider and enterprise customers starting to sort of test the waters. I think they see it as an opportunity to reduce their life cycle management of technology obligations and I think to be a lot more agile in how they implement infrastructure. And so, I think we're definitely seeing the front edge of that. I think we're seeing a lot of excitement about things like VMware Cloud on Equinix Metal. And so I think that we'll continue to be quite optimistic about that piece of the business. But we're definitely learning how to effectively sell that and how to sort of get in front of different personas. And I know Karl and the go-to-market teams are really evolving our approach in those areas, but we feel very optimistic about it.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. And do you feel this current environment helps that selling proposition or kind of makes it more challenging?\nCharles Meyers: I think it helps it in many respects. I think overall, people are looking for a way to advance the digital agenda that they have and do it as efficiently and as effectively and with as much agility as possible. And so again, we've seen strong demand. I think that the -- those services that are more on-demand, more agile, I do think, have an increasing level of appeal to customers.\nChip Newcom: This concludes our Q4 conference call. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Keith Taylor",
            "content": "Thank you, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. To start, we had a great end to the year, finishing Q4 with healthy bookings, strong pricing, which included a nice uplift in MRR per cabinet in each of our regions and a solid forward-looking demand pipeline. We closed over 17,000 deals across more than 6,000 customers in 2022, and no single customer represents more than 3% of our MRR, highlighting the tremendous scale, reach and diversity of our go-to-market engine that continues to produce despite volatile and shifting macro conditions. Given the weaker U.S. dollar relative to our prior guidance rates, FX has shifted from a meaningful headwind to a tailwind, which is positive, although 2023 exchange rates still remain below the average FX rates for 2022. And while we continue to remain vigilant to the challenges in the broader economy, we do remain optimistic about our business and the key demand drivers and feel we're very well positioned to grow and scale due to our industry-leading risk management efforts across procurement and strategic sourcing, power and treasury and our future-first sustainability program. Also, the diversity and mix of our customers is benefiting us, with large established businesses constituting a majority of our revenues has greater than 80% of our recurring revenues come from companies generating $100 million or more in annual revenues. And more than 85% of our recurring revenues in the quarter come from customers deployed in three or more data centers, making Equinix a core vendor for our customers' digital infrastructure needs. Equinix remains in excellent financial health with strong liquidity positions, low net leverage, allowing us to be both strategically and operationally flexible in this current market environment. Now as part of our larger programmatic approach to managing power costs, we initiated efforts to enhance our customer communications last fall, providing our customers insights into our efforts while continuing to protect our customers and ourselves against the rising costs through our multiyear hedging efforts. At the start of 2023, we raised our power prices primarily in the EMEA region to recover these rising costs. While power markets remain volatile, our hedging approach meaningfully dampened the impact of the inflated energy costs for many of our customers. We expect these power price increases will generate approximately $350 million of incremental revenues and costs in 2023. And as a result, the cumulative power price increases are expected to increase our revenue growth by approximately 500 basis points. Now despite these increases, our cost management efforts have protected both our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO on a dollar basis, but as expected, have negatively impacted our adjusted EBITDA margins for the year. We expect these higher energy costs to be transitory and should reverse course over our future yet-to-be-determined period, at which time both our gross profit and adjusted EBITDA margins will return to our targeted and expected levels. Now let me cover the highlights for the quarter. Note that all comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q4 revenues were $1.871 billion, up 11% over the same quarter last year, above the midpoint of our guidance range on an FX-neutral basis, largely due to strong recurring revenues led by the Americas region. We continue to enjoy net positive pricing actions in the quarter. And similar to prior quarter, price increases outpaced price decreases by a ratio of 3:1. Q4 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included an $8 million tailwind when compared to our prior guidance rates due to the weaker U.S. dollar in the quarter. As we look forward, we expect a significant step-up in Q1 recurring revenues, largely due to strong net bookings performance and significant power price increases. Global Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $839 million or 45% of revenues, up 7% over the same quarter last year, at the top end of our guidance range due to strong operating performance. Q4 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges included a $1 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates and $7 million of integration costs. Global Q4 AFFO was $658 million, above our expectations due to strong operating performance, including seasonally higher recurring CapEx and included an $11 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q4 MRR churn was 2.2%, a derivative of disciplined sales execution, whereby we put the right customer with the right application into the right asset. For the year, MRR churn was better than expected with the average quarterly MRR churn at the low end of our guidance range. As we look forward into 2023, we expect MRR churn to remain comfortably within our targeted 2% to 2.5% per quarter range. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC was the fastest revenue-growing region on a year-over-year normalized basis at 17%, followed by the Americas and EMEA regions at 10% and 9%, respectively. The Americas region had another quarter of strong gross bookings, lower MRR churn and continued favorable pricing trends led by our New York, Toronto and Washington, D.C. metros. The strength in the region remains broad-based, and the acquired Antel assets in Chile and Peru have performed better than we planned. Our EMEA region delivered a strong quarter with continued healthy pricing trends and an attractive retail mix as well as record inter- 40 new logos in 2022, and we're already seeing customer interest for our Jakarta and Johor sites. And now looking at the capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our balance sheet increased slightly to greater than $30 billion, including an unrestricted cash balance of $1.9 billion. As expected, our quarter-over-quarter cash balance decreased due to the significant planned increase in growth CapEx and real estate purchases and our quarterly cash dividend. I said previously, we plan to take a balanced and opportunistic approach to accessing the capital markets when conditions are favorable. As such, we're happy to share that we recently priced a Japanese yen private placement, raising the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $600 million of debt with an average duration of greater than 14 years and a blended cost to borrow an attractive 2.2%. This transaction is expected to fund in Q1. We also executed some ATM forward sale transactions in Q4, providing $300 million of incremental equity funding when settled. Pro forma for these transactions, we have nearly $7 billion of readily available liquidity and remain very well funded to meet our ongoing cash needs. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $828 million, including recurring CapEx of $80 million. In the quarter, we opened six retail projects in Geneva, Los Angeles, Osaka, Singapore, Washington, D.C. and Zurich and three xScale projects in Dublin, Sao Paulo and Osaka. We also purchased our Geneva two and Sao Paulo four IBX assets as well as land for development in London. Revenues from owned assets increased to 63% of our recurring revenues for the quarter. Our capital investments delivered strong returns, as shown on Slide 10. Our now 158 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 87% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. As a reminder, similar to prior years, we plan to update our stabilized asset summary on the Q1 earnings call. And finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 of our summary of 2023 guidance and bridges. Do note, all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. Starting with revenues, for 2023, we expect top line revenues will step up by nearly $1 billion, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 14% to 15%. Excluding our power price pass-throughs, we expect top line revenue growth to range between 9% and 10%, above the top end of our long-term growth rates, as highlighted at our 2021 Analyst Day, reflecting the continued momentum in the business. We expect 2023 adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 45%, excluding integration costs. And excluding the impact of power price increases to revenues and higher utility costs, adjusted EBITDA margins would approximate 48%, the result of strong operating leverage and efficiency initiatives. We expect to incur $35 million of integration costs in 2023. 2023 AFFO is expected to grow between 9% and 12% compared to the previous year, and AFFO per share is expected to grow 8% to 10% at the top end of our long-term range from our 2021 Analyst Day. 2023 CapEx is expected to range between $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, including approximately $150 million of on-balance sheet xScale spend, which we expect to be reimbursed as we transfer assets into the joint ventures and about $205 million of recurring CapEx spend. And finally, we're increasing the annual growth rate of our cash dividend on a per share basis to 10% due to strong operating performance. The cash dividend will approximate $1.3 billion, a 12% year-over-year increase, 100% of which is expected to be attributed to operating performance. So let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles. Yes. The only other thing I would say in book-to-bill, last year, there were some supply chain constraints. We don't foresee any meaningful amount of that this year as it relates to the installation of our customers, so continue to be optimistic about that. And as it relates to xScale, I was just saying in the prepared remarks, you can see that there's a tremendous amount of capacity that we're building across our xScale sort of portfolio. And it's exciting. And so as that relates to not only the opportunity, and not counter to Simon's maybe worried bit, we're seeing the -- a lot of volume opportunities sitting inside the xScale business. So that's good. And then from a price point, no surprise, costs have moved up and pricing, therefore, has moved up to recover that cost and get the appropriate returns. So, I feel good from both perspectives. One, there's the volume that's there. There's the activity that we're building to support that volume, and we're getting the price points and the returns that we feel are appropriate for this juncture. And Frank, let me just maybe add on to what Charles said there. As we think about our business, and I said this at the Analyst Day two years ago and we'll certainly update you in the June Analyst Day coming, but when you think about pricing, historically, it was running at about 6% of our bookings. And we've said that price increases are in the range of 3% to 5% and our stabilized revenue -- our stabilized assets are growing at recurring revenue at 6% right now. So, I think you're going to get it from a number of different spots: number one, inflation. You've got the inflationary impact, and of course, that is going to move the pricing up higher than where we historically have been. And Charles was also alluding to the fact we also are moving list pricing. And so, when you look at list pricing, plus you've got the inflationary increases and then you've got the PPIs in addition to adding what we think is great value across our set of products and services, you have a broader influence coming from not just -- you have quantity but you have price. And I think that's something that we'll continue to sort of track and update you on as we come to the June Analyst Day, as I said. Two to three years. Inside the retail business. xScale, of course, is longer than that. In xScale or in retail? Yes, the average is two to three. Again, I don't have any more refined than that. That just gives you an indication of how things will renew. And as a result, one of the things I said at least in my prepared remarks is when you look at price increases relative to price decreases, we always talk about net positive pricing actions and you've heard us mention that quarter after quarter for years. It's a reflection that it's a living and breathing organism. And that there's always going to be movement and you're renegotiating with your customers. And some people, you'll adjust down, but the bias is towards price increases, not only because that's how the model works, but you're really going to see that come through as again, you feel the inflationary impacts, you go through the power price increases, and it manifests itself in our -- on a currency-adjusted MRR per cabinet number across all three regions. And that will continue to be something that we will monitor very, very closely. So Singapore, let me step back first. And when I talk -- when we think about Q4, which obviously is the most current guide, you see that we did slightly better than we guided to despite some of the movements. And as we sort of mentioned in the last call, we normally accelerate some costs into fourth quarter, largely for repairs and maintenance and some outside consulting work. And we expect it, our utility costs, to go up largely because of the seasonal aspect, less about the Singapore PPIs but the seasonal aspect. And part of the reason that we did a little bit better was those utility rates didn't go up as much as we anticipated. And then we've seen some moderation in price. Price and power is still inflated but moderated relative to some of our assumptions. So when you look at the fourth quarter, I would say that it performed exactly as we anticipated with a little bit of benefit attributed to power savings and really with the operating performance and then better revenues. Specifically to Singapore though, when we look at the sort of the net hit for Singapore last year, think of it in the order of magnitude of $50 million to $60 million. The reason I'm giving you a range is there was a substantial increase or a weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Singapore dollar. And so when you look at the net impact, it had a little bit of a knock-on effect on our results because obviously, you're absorbing a cost at a higher exchange rate. And so that would -- that gives you a sense of where we are in Singapore. As you then sort of fast forward to 2023, one of the things that we had mentioned in 2022 for the costs that we do not recover from Singapore in 2022 because we were out of market, market has moved to Equinix and part of the recovery that you're seeing and it's embedded in that $350 million is basically recovering cost that -- the cost increase in Singapore that we didn't recover in 2022. So it gives you a sense, there's think of, again, in the order of magnitude of $50 million to $60 million, is that number that you should be thinking about. Does that answer your question, Mike? I want to make sure that we -- because you're asking about the P&L. I want to make sure that we hit that question for you. No. I mean, it's relatively -- is consistent with what we said. I mean, part of what you're getting is a normalized versus a normalized without power pass-through. And so the difference between those two is we're saying that if -- we would have done a little bit better had we not been exposed to that Singapore exposure. Yes, definitely. Let me give you a little color on that, Mike. So we -- the investments that we were -- and I've talked about this in a few different forums, that we're holding a pretty tight line on G&A. We are definitely investing in the go-to-market engine so that's a clear area of investment. I think we'll be approaching closer to 700 quota-bearing heads. And so we've definitely made that investment. Some of those are -- many of those were already on board at our Connect sales event -- sales kickoff event and are raring to go for the year. But we're still adding some as we speak. Product is really not an area of significant incremental investment, but we are adapting sort of exactly how we're spending our product level investments. Scott Crenshaw has come in on the digital services side, and I think we're evolving our areas of focus. We're going to continue to focus on -- we think Metal continues to have significant opportunity. Network Edge is continuing to see momentum in the market. But I think evolving Metal to be a more foundational platform for the ecosystem to bring value to our platform is something we see a lot of value in. And so, we're excited about the VMC on Equinix that partnership with VMware. And I think that's sort of more of sort of the color of things to come in terms of more investment in the ecosystem. And so, I think that's something you're going to see. And then we're also going to probably make some efficiency and continued efficiency programs that we think are going to drive long-term, either power efficiencies in terms of PUE improvement, and/or labor efficiencies in the business because we do believe that at some point down the road, we're going to have to use margin expansion as a way to drive AFFO per share growth. If you look at the current guide, it's really being driven by top line growth and then flow through, right? And so -- and we're -- but at a very healthy margin. So absent the PPI, we're at about 48% margin, a little bit of an increase, about 10 bps from where we would have been in 2022. We would have been higher than that because we are delivering operating leverage on G&A and other areas of the business. But we've reinvested it into those areas that I just described for you. So let me take the first question, David, and thanks for doing the math. So let me start off at the highest level. We expect to book more in 2023 than we booked on a net basis than we did in 2022. So you can see that the business is going to continue to perform at a nice clip. There's a lot of non-recurring activities that go on in the business, particularly around xScale. But I would say that xScale, in addition, we expect to do more in 2023 than we did in 2022. You've got some currency movements and some relatively meaty movements. But currency is now starting to feel like it's at our back. But as I said, 2023 rates are still below the average rates of 2022, and so you're taking a little bit of a hit. And the order of magnitude of that hit, just to give you a sense on the averages is about $160 million to the top line. So you've got a little bit going on there, but I think if you go back just to the fundamentals, all else being equal, if currencies continue to move as they had been, although we've been a little bit of a blip over the last couple of weeks, another 10% move in currencies is a substantial uplift in our revenues. And so not only would it recapture the averages that we saw in 2022, it would give you more wind at your back for 2023. And so bottom line is there's nothing fundamental. We're obviously giving you a little bit wider range, given the economic environment that we're operating in today. That was very deliberate and it's very early in the year. And so for those reasons, I say, look, that's the guide. It's got a wide range and we're planning to execute against the plan that I just mentioned. And Eric, let me just add maybe to what Charles has said. And again, in our prepared remarks, one of the things that was really important that we wanted to share with our -- the group here is the fact that we're funding the business. So, we not only have the cash on the balance sheet, we're bringing capital -- more capital on the balance sheet to fund 49 major projects that we've at least announced thus far across many metros. And we're going to be in 75 metros in not too far from now. So, you got a sense, one, the capital plan is increasing. We think we've got the supply chain well secured. We have a really good procurement team and strategic sourcing team that makes sure that we have the resources available. And then you've got a global design and construction team, they're doing just an excellent job delivering the capacity as quickly as we can deliver it. And it's tough out there in some markets. But I think it was really important to understand not only the volume there, we've got strategic planning, sourcing in place. We have the capital that we need. And we're setting ourselves up to fund all those things through 2023 and put us in a really good position as we start 2024. And so leverage is not going to shift in any meaningful way so it gives us that enhanced flexibility. And at the same time, we've all effectively prefunded a lot of the costs into the model, and we are now enjoying the benefits of this large expansion or this growth initiative that Charles has alluded to, both on the physical side and on the digital side. And so, it's the combination of all those things that really give us -- make us feel very good about our capital plan, our balance sheet and the liquidity position we're in right now."

            "name": "Charles Meyers",
            "content": "Thank you, Chip. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. We had a great finish to 2022, delivering one of the best bookings performances in our history, led by the Americas with continued strength in demand and favorable pricing trends across all three regions. For the full year, we delivered more than $7 billion in revenue for the first time and completed our 80th consecutive quarter of revenue growth, an amazing 20 years of continuous growth, all while driving AFFO per share performance above the top end of our long-term expectations. As we look to the year ahead, even amidst a dynamic and complex global landscape, it's increasingly clear that the secular tailwinds of digital transformation remain strong. In 2023, IDC estimates spending on digital technology by organizations will grow 8x faster than the broader economy. In the current macroeconomic environment, we believe spending on digital transformation will remain robust for two simple reasons. First, as companies work harder for each incremental revenue dollar, digital is seen as a critical driver of competitive differentiation, accelerating time to market and enabling product set evolution. And second, digital transformation is increasingly a means to do more with less, enabling businesses to reduce costs and drive operating leverage while simultaneously becoming more agile and responsive in serving their customers. In the context of this secular demand environment, we remain confident that Platform Equinix is uniquely positioned to support our customers' digital infrastructure needs. Digital leaders are demanding infrastructure that is more distributed, more ecosystem-powered, more flexible and more interconnected because it is fundamental to their ability to differentiate in the marketplace and lower their costs. Our market-leading global reach, vibrant digital ecosystems and comprehensive interconnection platform allow our customers to scale with agility, speed to launch of digital services, deliver world-class experiences and enhance value to all their stakeholders. While we will continue to closely monitor the macro environment and we'll adapt our execution accordingly, the fundamentals of our business remain strong, and we're investing behind the momentum we're seeing, including adding quota-bearing heads, evolving our product set and expanding our industry-leading data center portfolio. With regards to power, our multiyear hedging efforts continue to create visibility and predictability for Equinix and our customers in the coming year. Effective January 1, we raised pricing, passing on the full impact of these additional power costs to our customers, increasing costs but giving our customers much needed budget certainty and, in most cases, leaving them with rates below the prevailing spot market. Overall, we believe we remain in a good position relative to competitors and the broader market, and I'm pleased with where we landed for our customers and our business. Turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for the full year were $7.3 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 8% year-over-year and AFFO per share grew 11% year-over-year. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our data center services portfolio continues to extend its scale and reach. And given strong demand and high utilization, we see continued opportunity to deliver highly attractive returns on capital, as evidenced by the largest development pipeline in our history. We currently have 49 major projects underway across 35 metros in 23 countries, including nine xScale projects representing over 34,000 cabinets of retail and over 75 megawatts of xScale capacity. New projects this quarter include new data center builds in Istanbul, Seoul and Tokyo, and our first builds in both Johannesburg, South Africa and Johor, Malaysia. Our new IBX in Johannesburg augments our current footprint in Africa, entering the largest and most digitally developed nation on the continent. And our new IBX in Johor represents our entry into one of the most requested markets in Asia Pacific by our global customers. Equinix remains the best manifestation of the interconnected digital edge. And with these new builds, our unparalleled global footprint will span 75 metros and 35 countries. The strength of our global platform continues to shine, with nearly 90% of our revenue coming from customers operating in multiple metros and nearly 2/3 coming from customers operating in all three regions. Key multi-market wins this quarter included one of the world's leading hospitality companies, finding performance gains at the edge by deploying in strategic markets across all three regions; and a leading cloud and CDN provider extending coverage and scaling globally to support new services and meet growing demand. IDC estimates that more than 750 million cloud-native applications will be developed globally by 2025. And as this digital transformation wave continues, customers see Equinix as the logical point of nexus for hybrid and multi-cloud deployments. This quarter, we won four new cloud on-ramps, including one in Mumbai, making it the 12th metro on Platform Equinix enabled with native cloud on-ramps from all five of the leading cloud providers. No other data center operator has more than one metro with all five clouds. In our xScale business, we continue to see strong overall demand, leasing approximately 8 megawatts of capacity across our Tokyo 12 and Osaka two assets with meaningful expansions in our forward pipeline. Enterprise wins leveraging the cloud this quarter include a global technology company in the payments industry, deploying infrastructure to place their corporate and customer networks closer to AWS and Azure; and a leading paints and coatings company choosing Equinix for its cloud on-ramp capabilities and virtualized service offerings. Our industry-leading interconnection franchise continues to perform well with revenues for the quarter growing 13% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, outpacing the broader business. We now have over 446,000 total interconnections on our platform. In Q4, we added an incremental 4,500 organic interconnections, slightly lower than our historical run rate due to seasonally slower gross adds, customer consolidations into higher bandwidth BCs on fabric and some elevated grooming activity. Equinix Fabric saw continued growth and is now operating at a $200 million revenue run rate, one of our fastest-growing products. Attach rates for Fabric continue to move higher with 40% of customers realizing the benefits of connecting their digital infrastructure at software speed. Internet exchange saw peak traffic jump 7% quarter-over-quarter and 28% year-over-year to greater than 29 terabits per second, driven by FIFA World Cup streaming demand and reflecting the continued strategic importance of having the world's largest Internet exchange footprint on Platform Equinix. Key interconnection wins this quarter included one of Korea's largest conglomerates, establishing interconnection in Seoul for SJC2, the Southeast Asia-Japan Cable, which will be ready for service this year, and the largest water authority in the Netherlands, implementing Equinix Fabric to directly and securely connect to distributed infrastructure and digital ecosystems to ensure a clean water supply. Turning to our digital services portfolio, we saw continued momentum with Equinix Metal and Network Edge, driving attractive pull-through to Fabric. Digital services wins this quarter included a leading insurance and financial services company evolving their internal systems from their own data center to a public cloud plus Metal approach at Equinix; and a Belgian advertising service provider using Equinix Metal for fast, efficient, reliable data movement to support localized online advertising. And our channel program delivered its seventh consecutive record quarter, accounting for nearly 40% of bookings and nearly 60% of new logos. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and digital first-use cases with hybrid multi-cloud as the clear architecture of choice. We saw continued strength from partners like AT&T, Avant, Cisco, HPE and Microsoft. Key wins included delivering a critical time-sensitive site migration for a multinational banking and financial services client in partnership with Options IT and Dell, leveraging a combination of Equinix Metal, Network Edge and Fabric to overcome supply chain delays and ensure continuity of operations while interconnecting to critical trading platforms. So let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results from the quarter. Thanks, Keith. Our record of strong and consistent operating performance continued in 2022, and I'm proud of how the team delivered value for our customers and our shareholders. In 2023 and beyond, we believe the opportunity for our business remains significant as enterprises and service providers alike look to Platform Equinix as their key digital infrastructure partner to advance their digital transformation agenda. To expand our market leadership, reinforce our competitive advantage and drive sustained value creation, the leadership team and I have outlined a clear set of priorities for the coming year. First, we intend to press our advantage in our interconnected colo franchise, continuing to scale and evolve our best-in-class bookings engine, delivering on key projects to enhance operating leverage, further extending our superior global reach, refining processes and systems to enhance the Equinix experience for our customers and partners, and integrating our sustainability leadership into our services in ways that better help our customers meet their commitments to environmental and social responsibility. Second, we intend to continue to enrich our platform value proposition by accelerating our digital services growth, delivering a more unified set of platform capabilities and by investing in ecosystem enablement, empowering key partners to bring their value to our platform more quickly and easily and allowing us to leverage their significant go-to-market reach. And we will advance these priorities by continuing to cultivate a culture that remains firmly people-first. We're committed to making Equinix a place that attracts, inspires and develops the best talent in our industry, cultivating an in-service-to mindset and creating a place where every person every day can say, \"I'm safe, I belong and I matter.\" In closing, our business remains well positioned. Despite a challenging macroeconomic and sociopolitical environment, digital transformation remains a clear priority across all industries and digital leaders will continue to harness our trusted platform to bring together and interconnect the foundational infrastructure that powers their success. In that vein, we're pleased to welcome Tom Olinger to our Board of Directors. As the longtime CFO at Prologis, Tom has extensive international operating experience spanning real estate and technology, which will benefit our business. I'd also like to thank Budd Lyons for his exceptional service and contributions to the growth and success of the Company over the past 15 years as he rotates off the Board. So let me stop there and open it up for questions. Sure. Thanks, Simon. Yes, both questions, we fully expected would be there. In terms of the overall macro environment, I would say, I think that the discussion has been interesting in terms of the cloud providers talking about customers being a bit more cautious. I think in specifics around customers who have really significantly expanded their investment in cloud and the workloads they're moving to cloud, et cetera, and many of whom I think have said, \"Wow, cloud -- our cloud bill has gone crazy on us, and we really need to step back and take a look at that.\" I do think that we see some of that dynamic. We actually see that dynamic, to some degree, playing in our favor in that customers are actually, one, sort of saying, \"Hey, what are -- it's not blindly sort of everything to cloud. It is really what is the appropriate mix of infrastructure requirements and how are we going to use the various clouds and how we're going to do that effectively? And how are we going to have the agility to move things between clouds?\" And so, I think we've seen customers really, one, very committed to their digital transformation agenda; two, I do think that they -- even though they have that commitment, it's probably in the context of a sort of a broader belt-tightening environment for overall budgets. And so, I do think they're being appropriately cautious about their investments. I think that they are -- we're seeing that they are -- I heard one CEO characterize it as measure twice, cut once in terms of how customers are thinking about their investments. But we definitely see them leaning in on digital overall. And I would say that we -- even in the cloud space, the amount of adds that are going in and the incremental revenue that the cloud providers are adding is still absolutely staggering. And in terms of overall quantum, it's quite consistent. It's coming down because the growth rates are coming down because you're on a very huge base. But overall, I think people still very committed to hybrid and multi-cloud as their architecture of choice. And I think they're really viewing Equinix as a key partner in figuring out how to appropriately manage and efficiently manage infrastructure costs going forward. So while we are seeing, I think, and people being appropriately cautious in a macro environment that would dictate that, we're still quite optimistic about the overall demand profile in our pipeline. And our conversion rates continue to sort of make us feel confident in that. And then the second one, relative to the power pass-through, we feel very good. We've got -- we've communicated that out to customers. We've had a lot of inquiries. Most of those inquiries are simply about explaining and providing them additional information on the charges. And so to this point, we feel very confident that we're -- continue to feel very confident we're going to get full recovery of that. And we'll continue to update you as we learn more. But right now, all systems go. Sure. Yes. Again, we're very excited. As evident in the guide, we continue to feel very optimistic about the top line of the business. Obviously, it's a bit elevated with the power price pass-through. But even on an adjusted basis, excluding that 9% to 10%, which is above the long-term guide that we had provided at the Analyst Day. So, I think it reflects the overall strength in the business. And we're seeing really across-the-board strength. I think in colo and interconnection, in digital services and really across the regions. And we're seeing a combination of solid volume and very strong pricing. And so, I definitely think pricing is going to continue to contribute, and that is separate and apart from the power price increase. Even if you take that 9% to 10%, I think us increasing list pricing, which I think in sort of an inflationary environment, we have to demonstrate that we can do that. And I think we're having good success with that. So, I think the colo business remains strong, unit volumes on colo interconnection growing at 13%. Again, we saw slightly softer unit adds there, but I think we feel like that will probably normalize through the course of the year. And then digital services, we came off a really strong quarter. 2022 was really, I think, the front end of an inflection point of really, people saying, this is a great way for us to think about how to really use the power of the interconnected edge at Equinix in new ways. And so, I think we're going to see great strength there. The Americas business performed -- '22 is just an amazing year for the Americas business. I think EMEA really demonstrated some strength coming off the back end of the interconnection price increases and continuing to really evolve that portfolio to the retail suite. And then Asia is our fastest-growing region at 17%. So again, I feel very good that we've got pretty comprehensive strength in volume and in price across products and across geographies. Sure, yes. Generally, I think that the book-to-bill, we have not seen any extensions of book-to-bill. I think in terms of quote to book, in other words, what's the sales cycle, I think we're seeing some anecdotal evidence of this sort of measure twice, cut once. But again, the team has -- is seeing strong conversion rates, solid pipeline and continue to feel good overall. So haven't seen any material change, although again, anecdotal evidence that you're seeing a little just caution in terms of customers really making sure that they're buying exactly what they need in the right amounts. And that's not surprising in sort of the macro kind of environment that we have. And then, Keith, I don't know if you have any further comment on book-to-bill and then xScale. Sure, yes. I mean, the power pass-through is a really easy one to think through. It's on the order of $350 million on the revenue line and on the expense line. So -- and it's just -- and that's really what causes the 500 bp increase on the revenue line, obviously, without corresponding flow through to EBITDA. And so that impacts the EBITDA margin. But on a normalized basis, so as reported 45% guide but a normalized or excluding that 48%, which we think continues to look very good. And so -- and in terms of power price increases on the rest of the portfolio, I think we're seeing it -- we're going kind of across the board in space, power as well as in the digital services, making adjustments that we think are appropriate in the market. And part of that is just reflecting the increasing expense environment and some of the costs inside of the business that are going up. But then part of that is also just, I think, a really strong reflection of the value we deliver to the customer. And so, I think you're going to -- you're seeing the growth is certainly partially driven by strong pricing, and that's pretty consistent across the space, power and interconnect. Yes. And Frank, I'd offer that in a sort of -- we've become very adept at sort of managing and optimizing sort of the overall return profile in the business. And as you look at the current environment, which is strong underlying demand signal, high utilization rates in some markets, particularly we have some markets that are quite tight, it really gives us the opportunity as we look at how to optimize to not only sort of in a rising rate environment, look at how to optimize that and upon renewal, either take unutilized capacity and resell it at significantly higher rates or, in some cases, look to do that proactively. And so, I do think that, that works well for us as we continue to demonstrate that we've got a level of pricing power in the business. You want to take the first one on the PPI from '22? And of course, the overall quantum in 2023 is much larger, as I described earlier. And so -- but that's -- but I think we're clear on that in terms of how that affects both revenue and margins. Sure. A couple of areas, one is definitely on that ecosystem enablement side. We've got to make it easier for partners to bring their value to the platform. And so I think in terms of how we think about enabling them from the software side with APIs, richer APIs and easier -- an easier experience for customers and partners improving our portal and our software level, programmatic engagement opportunities at the API level, that's clearly going to be an area of investment. And then making the platform easier to use and more consistent. I think we -- that's one of the things we've heard from our channel partners, making it easier for them to quote and order and deliver our services, that's going to be a continued area of investment for us as well. So in terms of the Analyst Day, I mean, I think we'll -- that will actually be progressed well into the year, and I think we'll be able to give you a continued update on momentum in a number of areas. But I think we'll also continue to give you visibility in how we're evolving, driving the evolution to a more comprehensive platform value proposition. We'll really talk about being the infrastructure platform of choice for customers as they implement hybrid and multi-cloud as the architecture of choice. And so, I think updating you on what that means for our sort of traditional interconnected colo business and what that means for expansion of the platform, continued improvement of the customer experience. And then on the digital services side, how we'll continue to evolve the platform in terms of the service offerings with probably a real focus on Metal as a foundational piece of that. And then also on cloud networking. Networking is definitely an area of value add that we have always had for our customers and I think an area that we can continue to evolve the platform in terms of how we make it easier for customers to interconnect a variety of forms of infrastructure in a very cloud-centric world. And so, I think we'll talk you through those evolutions of the strategy and update you on where we're making investments and how we see the long-term outlook playing out as a result. Yes. I mean, we're definitely seeing strong fill rates and that's informing the continued investment in the development pipeline for sure. And I would say that we're -- so that's -- I think that's -- and I think we're seeing -- we're underwriting to return profiles in light of that, that I think are very consistent with what we've seen in the past. I definitely do think, on the second part of your question, that we are -- we've seen a meaningful uptick in cost, and we are expecting and anticipating and managing toward increases in pricing to maintain a consistent return profile. And thus far, I think we're seeing that our ability to have those price increases materialize in the market, in other words, our pricing power remains strong. So I think -- and in terms of whether they're stabilizing, I do think that, as Keith said, the supply chain situation, I think, is a bit more stable, and we were, I think, due to a good strong execution on our part and our scale and some of the capabilities we have, I think we managed it quite effectively. And I think we're continuing to be diligent about that going forward. So, I think we've stabilized a lot of the risks on the supply chain side. Labor is tight still in some markets. And there, like for example, in France, where with the Olympics coming up, it's just finding the ability to advance those projects on the time lines that you want is a challenging task for sure. So, I would say the labor piece is probably the one on the supply chain that is a little bit more an area to watch for us. But overall, I think we feel very good about the underwriting, a lot of it still going into our core campuses that have sort of a really, really well-established track record of fill rate. But we're also seeing some of our newer edge markets continue to perform well ahead of expectations. So yes, big development pipeline, managing it well and I think feeling good about our ability to sort of perform to that underwriting. Yes, great question. Starting on the interaction, look, we feel really good about the interconnection business overall growing at 13%. We're clearly being able to make adjustments to interconnection pricing alongside broader list prices, so the pricing element is strong there. As I said, we did see a little weaker -- Q4 is seasonally a bit weaker, but definitely, this Q4 is weaker than prior Q4s. And I think there is some consolidation. I think it's partially due to just, as I said, the behavior of customers for -- interconnection is probably as close to we have to a usage-based service. It was -- some of our digital services are more usage based. But in the colo environment, that's as close as we have to usage-based services. When people -- things start to get paid, people immediately look at the things they can impact the fastest. And so I think it's pretty common for them to look at the portfolio and say, do I have interconnection I'm not using or that's underutilized that I could consolidate on the higher circuits? And I think that's some of the dynamic that we're seeing. So, I'd expect to -- and then we did see a little bit of, in terms of these virtual BCs to cloud ZNs, a little lighter on gross adds, still very healthy gross adds, by the way, because the cloud -- I think cloud and workload migration continues very full tilt and despite sort of what people are saying about the reducing growth rates of their cloud business, we're still seeing that very. But it is a little bit lower in terms of gross adds than it was. And so -- but I think that we tend to see that -- those kinds of dynamics as something that's a bit of a burst of activity as people go through budget cycles and then they kind of run out of gas on their ability to sort of squeeze more out of that. And so we'll monitor it closely. I continue to feel like the bottom line is that customers really see our interconnection platform as fundamental to how they're thinking about go-forward hybrid and multi-cloud architectures. And so, I think the demand profile for the business for the interconnection over the long term is going to continue to be really strong. And then on the second part around digital services, I definitely think that we're starting to see a realization from customers and the ability of our sales teams to articulate that services like Metal and their ability to deliver more on-demand infrastructure that can help customers be more agile is something we're seeing an inflection point on. We won some very marquee deals in Q4 of last year. I think we're seeing very large service provider and enterprise customers starting to sort of test the waters. I think they see it as an opportunity to reduce their life cycle management of technology obligations and I think to be a lot more agile in how they implement infrastructure. And so, I think we're definitely seeing the front edge of that. I think we're seeing a lot of excitement about things like VMware Cloud on Equinix Metal. And so I think that we'll continue to be quite optimistic about that piece of the business. But we're definitely learning how to effectively sell that and how to sort of get in front of different personas. And I know Karl and the go-to-market teams are really evolving our approach in those areas, but we feel very optimistic about it. I think it helps it in many respects. I think overall, people are looking for a way to advance the digital agenda that they have and do it as efficiently and as effectively and with as much agility as possible. And so again, we've seen strong demand. I think that the -- those services that are more on-demand, more agile, I do think, have an increasing level of appeal to customers."

We would also like to remind you that we post important information about Equinix on the IR page from time to time and encourage you to check our website regularly for the most current available information. With us today are Charles Meyers, Equinix's CEO and President; and Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up in an hour, we would like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to just one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thanks, Katrina. Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We had another outstanding quarter as global demand for digital infrastructure continues to grow, and customer preferences trend convincingly toward architectures that are highly distributed, persistently hybrid, deeply cloud connected and increasingly on demand. All factors fueling the Equinix position as a trusted partner in digital transformation. This vigorous demand backdrop fueled another great quarter, delivering record gross and net bookings, with strong demand across all three regions, resulting in our 79th quarter of consecutive revenue growth and further demonstrating the resiliency and durability of our business, even in the face of a complex and challenging macro environment. It is increasingly evident that the global pandemic has been a catalyst for a fundamental shift in how customers view digital transformation and its importance as a strategic imperative. And this commitment to digital transformation continues even in the face of a broader dynamic of belt tightening, as companies look to do more with less and see digital as a catalyst to both maximize revenues and optimize costs. While we continue to closely monitor macro conditions and adapt our execution accordingly, the fundamentals of our business remain exceptionally strong. Our expansive global reach and robust interconnected ecosystems continue to attract a wide and diverse customer set as they prioritize digital investments, and embrace platform Equinix as a point of nexus to support hybrid and multi cloud. This wave of digital infrastructure demand and our highly differentiated value proposition are translating to a robust pipeline, a highly favorable pricing environment and low churn, all fueling record performance across the business year-to-date and setting us up for a strong trajectory as we look to 2023 and beyond. As customers navigate rising interest rates and broad based inflation, they're benefiting from our scale purchasing power and our sophisticated capabilities in hedging, risk management and sustainability. Our operating scale and scope give us a variety of levers to manage an increasingly dynamic environment, hedging currency, power and interest rates, investing in advanced procurement teams, expanding renewables coverage and taking a programmatic approach to improving the efficiency of our world-class data centers, an advanced set of capabilities supported by a strong and flexible balance sheet. Specifically, on power, we have had a keen focus in this area and continue to feel confident in our position. Our approach to multiyear hedging is affording Equinix the visibility and predictability to communicate to customers in advance of expected power price increases, and is allowing us to deliver cost points to customers that remain highly favorable against spot rates in many markets, as volatility persists. While our aim remains to dampen this volatility for our customers through hedging, we do expect meaningful increases in power costs in many markets, and per our contracts, the full impact of these additional power costs will be passed on to customers. Overall, we believe we remain in a good position relative to competitors and the broader market. Turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3. Revenues for Q3 were $1.84 billion, up 11% over the same quarter last year, driven by strong recurring revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA was up 11% year-over-year with AFFO meaningly -- meaningfully ahead of our expectations due to strong operating performance. Interconnection revenues continue to outpace the broader business growing 13% year-over-year. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Equinix continues to extend its leadership as the most interconnected platform with four on-ramp wins this quarter, bringing the total in our portfolio to more than 200 on-ramps across 44 markets. We now have 11 metros across platform Equinix enabled with on-ramps from all five of the leading cloud providers. No other competitor has more than one. In addition to placing critical networking nodes in on-ramps at Equinix, hyperscalers are also integral to our go-to-market notion as customers continue to aggressively migrate workloads to the cloud and demand cloud proximity for their own private cloud implementations. As indicated in our recently published Global Interconnection Index, current trend lines indicate that more than 80% of Global 2000 companies will be interconnecting with more than four hyperscale providers and over 30 SaaS providers or other business partners, on average by 2026. We're continuing to invest behind the momentum we're seeing in our data center services business with 46 major projects underway across 31 markets in 21 countries. We continue to build capacity under our xScale offering, including 10 ongoing xScale projects that we expect will deliver another 80 megawatts of capacity once opened. This quarter, we added six new projects, including new data center builds in Barcelona, Tokyo and our first organic build in Jakarta, Indonesia. Our new IBX in Jakarta will add a strategically important high-growth market to our platform, as we look to enable local businesses and global organizations to unleash Indonesia's digital potential. This commitment to market leading reach continues to drive our business with customers operating in all three regions, now accounting for an amazing 64% of our recurring revenues. Key customer expansions this quarter included StackPath, a leading edge computing platform provider, which expanded into Dubai and Mumbai to support the growth of its worldwide edge compute delivery and security offerings. A win with a global multinational airline leveraging Equinix to connect to their federated ecosystem of partner airlines, as well as a significant multi metro expansion with one of the world's largest custodian banks, deploying across all three regions and utilizing the full suite of Equinix digital services. On that note, our digital services portfolio saw continued momentum as companies increasingly demand infrastructure and interconnection services that can be delivered as a service and on demand. Equinix Metal had a strong bookings quarter as customers leverage flexibility and agility across multiple metros. Wins this quarter included a major design win with a global SaaS provider and a significant expansion with a leading pediatric treatment and research facility using Network Edge and Equinix fabric to create an edge hosting environment in key U.S. metros and enable seamless and high-performance connectivity to their cloud partners. In Q3, we added an incremental 7,300 interconnections and now have over 443,000 total interconnections on our platform. Equinix Fabric had another strong quarter as interconnection diversity continues to increase. Expansions this quarter included Colt Technology Services, further expanding its footprint in Europe and interconnectivity with Equinix Fabric to optimize performance for its customers, as well as the financial software tools and enterprise applications provider implementing a global network optimization project leveraging Equinix Fabric. Internet Exchange saw peak traffic up 8% quarter-over-quarter and 28% year-over-year to greater than 27 terabits per second, representing the largest peak traffic growth since prior to the pandemic. Our channel program delivered a six consecutive record quarter accounting for 37% of bookings and approximately 60% of new logos, and remains a critical vector in how we are expanding our reach and scaling our go-to-market engine. We continue to see particular strength from strategic cloud technology and systems integrator partners like AWS, Cisco, Dell, Google HPE, Infosys and Microsoft. This segment accounted for approximately half of our channel bookings, and continues to grow in both deal dollar -- deal and dollar volume. With these partners, we jointly offer a blend of IT and networking technologies that will allow customers to interconnect seamlessly with hyperscale cloud and other as a service providers, and benefit from solutions that deliver optimal performance, cost, security agility and scale across our global platform. Channel wins included a U.K insurance firm with Equinix Partner Softcat for a data center consolidation and modernization project at our London campus where technology elements from HPE, Cisco and Palo Alto Networks are being brought together in a cloud adjacent architecture, all directly interconnected to Microsoft and AWS. Now, let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results for the quarter.\nKeith Taylor: Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. As you can see from our results, the Equinix team continues to execute for our customers, our communities and for our investors. Our go-to-market engine delivered record gross and net bookings in Q3, closing over 4,200 deals with more than 3,000 customers. Our success is derived from the breadth of our service offerings, the scale of our growing platform, the quality of our operations organization and the focus of our investing for the longer term. For the quarter, our net bookings performance moved up significantly, both compared to our Q3 expectations and the same quarter last year due to strong growth activity, a favorable pricing environment, lower-than-expected churn and the strength of our digital services offerings. Again, we had net positive pricing actions. Consequently, our consolidated MRR per cabinet increased to greater than $2,000 per cabinet despite the weaker foreign operating currencies. And note the expected price increases or PPI discussed by Charles are not in either are reported or are guided numbers. These price increases will be passed through to our customers in 2023. Over the past couple of months, we've been communicating with our customers about the pending power price increases. And most recently, we've notified them of the expected range of their power cost increase at the market level. The dialogue with our customers highlighted the value of our multiyear power planning and sourcing efforts, which is expected to meaningfully dampen the impact of inflated energy costs to many of our customers, both relative to the competition and the broader market. Finally, notwithstanding of strong bookings performance in Q3, our forward looking pipeline remains healthy. And our backlog and our book-to-bill interval remains constant, allowing us to remain confident as we look ahead into Q4 and plan for 2023. So given the momentum in our business, we're again raising our underlying guidance across each of our core financial metrics for the year. Now, while our business remains well-positioned and resilient, we continue to keep macro factors top of mind. Consequently, we chose to increase the liquidity position of the company. At quarter end, we had over $2.5 billion of unrestricted cash in our bank accounts, and full access to our $4 billion line of credit, increasing the financial and operational flexibility of the business. Our net leverage remains low at 3.5x our adjusted EBITDA, creating plenty of balance sheet flexibility. Now let me cover the highlights for the quarter. Note that all comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, Global Q3 revenues were $1.841 billion, up 11% over the same quarter last year, above the top end of our guidance range on an FX neutral basis, largely due to strong recurring revenues. Q3 through revenues net of our FX hedges included a $9 million impact when compared to our prior guidance rates, largely due to weaker euro and British pounds. Global Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $871 million or 47% of revenues, up 11% of the same quarter last year, above the top end of our guidance range due to strong cash flows profit and lower than planned operating costs, including professional fees and consulting costs. Q3 adjusted EBITDA net of our FX hedges included a $5 million FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates, and $4 million of integration costs. Global Q3 AFFO was $712 million, above our expectations due to strong operating performance and lower net interest expense and included a $5 million FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 MRR churn was 1.9%, a continued reflection of our disciplined sales execution to put the right customer with the right application into the right asset. For Q4, we expect MRR churn to continue to trend at the lower end of our 2% to 2.5% per quarter range. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC was the fastest growing region on a year-over-year normalized MRR basis at 19%, followed by the Americas and EMEA regions at 11% and 10%, respectively. The Americas region had another great quarter of a strong gross bookings, lower MRR churn and favorable pricing trends led by our Washington DC and New York metros. In August we added Lima, Peru to our platform as part of the Entel acquisition expanding our Latin American footprint, our fifth country and extending the Equinix platform to 32 countries and 71 markets globally. Our EMEA region delivered another record bookings quarter with strong pricing and robust channel activity, led by our Amsterdam, Dublin and Frankfurt markets with strength in our IT services and enterprise verticals. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a strong quarter with robust exports from Japan. As part of our future-first sustainability strategy, we're very proud to announce a partnership with the Center for Energy Research and Technology at the National University of Singapore to explore sustainable technologies and alternate fuel sources for data center infrastructure. And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our balance sheet increased slightly despite the weaker non-U.S operating currencies to $29.3 billion, including an unrestricted cash balance of $2.5 billion. Our cash balance increased quarter-over-quarter due to strong operating cash flow, and about $800 million of ATM activity settled in the quarter. As stated previously, we'll continue to take a balanced and opportunistic approach to accessing the capital markets when conditions are favorable. On the debt side of the house, on the heels of the rating upgrades from both Fitch and Moody's last quarter, S&P increased their debt tolerance for the company by one leverage turn, thereby increasing the level of flexibility from our balance sheet. We're pleased and appreciative of the rating improvements over the past quarters. I look forward to our continued dialogue with our rating agencies. Turning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $553 million, including a recurring CapEx of $50 million. In the quarter, we opened 6 retail projects in Istanbul, Madrid, Manchester, Melbourne, Paris and Toronto, and 2 xScale projects in Frankfurt and London. We also purchase land for development in Monterrey, Mexico. Our capital investments deliver strong returns as shown on Slide 10. A 160 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 7% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are now collectively 88% utilized, and generate a 29% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for a updated summary of 2022 guidance and bridges, including the anticipated financial results from the Entel, Peru purchase. For the full year 2022, due to strong momentum that we're seeing in the organic business, we now expect our revenues to increase between 10% and 11% on a normalizing constant currency basis over the prior year. Relative to our prior guidance, we're increasing our underlying revenues by $15 million due to strong recurring revenue performance. We expect 2022 underlying adjusted EBITDA that increased by $46 million compared to our prior guidance due to strong revenue performance and more operating spend. We now expect to incur $20 million of integration costs in 2022. We're raising our underlying 2022 AFFO by $52 million to grow between 10% and 11% on a normalized and constant currency basis, due to strong operating performance, and lower net interest expense. And as a result, our AFFO per share is now expected to grow between 9% and 10% on a normalized and constant currency basis, above the top end of our prior guide, including the impact from our Q3 ATM activity. Finally, 2022 CapEx is now expected to range between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion, including about $190 million of recurring CapEx and about $135 million of on balance sheet xScale spin, down slightly due to timing of expansion spent. So let me stop here. I'm going to turn the call back to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thanks, Keith. Our results this quarter continue to reflect strong execution by our global team and highlight the unique position that Equinix enjoys in facilitating digital transformation. As we continue to deliver exceptional business results, I want to also highlight our significant progress in advancing our future-first sustainability commitments. This quarter, in addition to our continued investments and commandments around the environmental sustainability, we're very pleased to have launched the Equinix Foundation, an employee-driven charitable organization working to advance digital inclusion through philanthropic grant making and strategic partnerships. The foundation reflects our ongoing commitment to social sustainability. And we're excited about the work we can do to build a better, more inclusive, more sustainable world, harnessing and amplifying the passion of our people to help close the digital divide in our communities across the globe. As we advance Q4 and position for 2023, our highly differentiated position continues to drive strong momentum, robust customer demand and a deep, high quality pipeline. We're delivering sustained growth at the top line and AFFO per share, while maintaining our clear focus on driving operating leverage across our business. We continue to effectively exercise multiple growth levers including expanded market reach, enhancement of our product portfolio, accelerated new logo capture through our multi channel go-to-market engine, pricing adjustments that reflect our exceptional value, and a commitment to a bold innovation and sustainability agenda, all of which demonstrates the resilience of Platform Equinix and highlights our ability to deliver distinct and durable value to our customers and our shareholders. So let me stop there and open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jon Atkin from RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead. Your line is open.\nJonathan Atkin: Thanks. Got two questions on energy. One is, Keith, if you could maybe refresh us on what portion of cash OpEx this quarter was for energy? And then on the PIs that you're pushing through starting next year, can you talk a little bit about to what extent it applies to customers that are in the middle of their contracts versus renewables and new contracts? Thanks.\nKeith Taylor: So, Jon, I'll take the first one, I think I'll pass the second one to Charles. It's roughly 13%. Again, it moves around quarter-on-quarter and it's also dependent on,-in some cases, the currency movements. But for this year, you should see the range anywhere sort of from 12% to 13% on a per revenue dollar basis.\nCharles Meyers: Yes. And on the PIs, Jon, the -- look, the way our contracts reads, we're not impaired in any way from putting those through -- during the -- of course, the contract. So they're not limited to when you take renewals. So just sort of backup and give you a view on, we talked a little bit about it in the script, but I think that we will give you details, more details when we do the '23 guide. But I think thanks to some really incredible work by our teams, we feel really good about where we are on that -- on the PI issue and on power generally. I think we're about 90%-plus, or more than -- well over 90% hedged in our deregulated markets, and we're going to be topping off those positions in the coming weeks and months. And we've already communicated those planned increases to customers, and are generally able, as Keith mentioned in his script, they will provide them with cost points that are meaningfully advantageous relative to current spot in those markets. So, I think we're going to -- we're in a really good position there. I think we're going to be able to pass a few. Obviously, they're not yet passed through, because we're still operating at our hedge rates from this year. But as they adjust, we've given them the advanced visibility to what they expect to see. And I think broadly speaking, they knew it was coming. And I think in a lot of cases, they're pleased to see that it's not quite as bad as they had feared it might be.\nJonathan Atkin: And if I could ask a little bit about cloud, we saw slowing growth at two of the three largest CSPs, not just percentage, but even in terms of like incremental revenue dollars. And I wondered what does it mean for your business in terms of maybe affecting the pace of cloud repatriation? And more broadly, as you look at your cabinet adds, how much of that would you attribute to things like Cloud Repatriation versus new logos versus just existing customers upsizing maybe talk a little bit about those moving parts?\nCharles Meyers: Yes, Jon, I do think Cloud Repatriation does happen, but I think it's probably getting more airtime than maybe it's -- it really is appropriated. I mean, I think we're still very early in the movement of clouds from traditional IP architectures into cloud. And that's what we continue to see and well, I recognize, we did see some slowdown from the cloud providers: one, that was impacted significantly by currency. And two, I think a lot of it has -- as I look through those reports, and heard that was sort of reductions in usage base volume, what are likely sort of non-mission critical workloads. And so, I think that -- as I talked to CIOs, their commitment to moving to cloud-based architectures, their commitment to moving significant percentages of their overall workloads to public cloud, and then integrating that with private cloud infrastructure that needs to be cloud proximate is still full tilt. And, in fact, I talked to a CIO that said that they had -- just a Fortune 200 type CIO, but they had an application estate that was 4,000-plus applications. And when I asked him how many of those had been migrated to cloud, it was in the range of 200. And so a long way to go. And so, if you look at the -- just the quantum of growth that's happening in the cloud, in any given quarter, they're adding just the top five providers or adding $3 billion to $4 billion of incremental recurring revenue. And so I think it is still a long way to go. And I think that we continue to be particularly relevant as people think about the way things used to work in IT architectures, they all live nicely together in a rack next to each other in an enterprise data centre. Well, as soon as you start migrating workloads to the cloud and then trying to interface them with your data and applications that you're still managing on your own, things don't work quite the same. And that's what we're seeing in our pipeline, people are saying, hey, I've got to have my hybrid, my private cloud proximate. It's got to be distributed. The applications all have to work together. And so I think we're still going to continue to see vigorous demand for this migration to hybrid and multi cloud for the foreseeable future.\nOperator: Our next question is from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead. Your line is open.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. Good evening. Just a couple if I could. Just continuing on, it's great to hear that strong demand trends, are you seeing any softness anywhere, any kind of whether it's Europe or whatever? One of your competitors talked about small enterprise is on pressure at the margin there. It seems like -- there's certainly some caution around the uncertain and macro environment. And if you put through some of these power price increases, does that change some of the profitability dynamics for some of these companies? And then just on margin, some really good performance I saw in, particularly in the Americas this quarter. Maybe you can update us on the 50% target and how Singapore is playing out as we exit 2022? Thanks.\nCharles Meyers: Sure. There's a lot there, Simon. But let me try to cover it. And if I forget any of it, just bring it back up. But any softness, look, we are not blind to sort of the challenging macro conditions in which we're all operating, that's for sure. But I would say that our bookings trajectory, our sales execution, our pipeline, quality of pipeline, volume of pipeline, all continue to be very solid. And that is across regions, and it is across sectors. And I think that the phenomenon that I was just describing an answer to Jon's question is an exceptionally horizontal one. People just moving to these new cloud-first hybrid IT architectures and I think seeing the relevance of Equinix in that. And so, are there customer segments or types that are having more challenges? That we could get that question a lot. I do think that we're less exposed to either startups or small company, that's typically not our sweet spot of our business. We're really more on enterprise level, both service provider and enterprise architectures, and how people are rethinking those globally. And so we continue to see a strong level of demand. And so, I think we're less exposed to that, perhaps, and then maybe public cloud providers and others that on small or startup type businesses that might be impacted. In terms of power and Europe, generally, I would say our European business is performing very well. And yes, we do expect that power is going to -- and again, it hasn't yet impacted that. We haven't rolled those through. One, a couple of comments on that. One, our history is that we've rolled pricing through in interconnection. In fact, if you look at the non-financial metrics, we've increased MRR per cab in Europe, $100 over the last four quarters. And that's driven by interconnection pricing, that's driven by mix of business, et cetera, but the European business is performing very well. I do think it will create a pinch for people that they're going to have to pay for more for power. But just put that into context, we think that a lot of our customers are going to see monthly increases that are really modest dependent on how concentrated they are in highly impacted markets. But we think that even in worst cases, where people are in a high impact market, they might be impacted by, call it, 15% to 20% of their monthly bill. And so, for most people, we don't believe that is something that will impact their overall commitment to their digital transformation. But it does create, and we think -- so we think that we're going to -- to be able to continue to sustain the demand levels that we're seeing. And then the last piece on margin. Again, we're kind of what we would expect we were actually slightly ahead in Q3, of where our expectations would have been. And Singapore is actually slightly better than what we expected for the full year. But thankfully that's sort of coming to an end. This is the last quarter where we'll see that. I think we'll be able to now make the adjustments that we needed to make in terms of passing through the appropriate price increases in full, in the markets impacted beginning in 2023. As I said, I think we're going to be able to do that in a way that customers, even though they're certainly not going to applaud those price increases, I think, as they look at it, in a lot of those markets, they're feeling it as consumers and they're feeling at a very acute level. And I think they're going to realize -- they're starting to realize what I think the benefits of our hedging programs are in terms of dampening that volatility for them.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you so much.\nKeith Taylor: And, Simon, let me just add a couple of other quick points, if I may in addition to what Charles said. First and foremost, the objective to get to 50% margin targets, as sort of Charles alluded to, we're doing better than we anticipated in the Americas. Singapore is better than anticipated. And overall, we're running the business with a great deal of discipline. And I say that with emphasis. And so number one, we're seeing margin profile that's better than you might have otherwise anticipated. Two, when you sort of look into the fourth quarter, we're making some discretionary decisions to accelerate costs into the fourth quarter. But after that we continue to drive the business with greater efficiency. As it relates to the 50% EBITDA margin target, just I've said this on a number of -- in a number of non-deal roadshows, and one-on-one discussions with investors. We're not shifting our emphasis to 50% EBITDA. We believe that we can get there. In fact, the performance of the business post the Analyst Day, we're actually doing better than we thought than we anticipated at that point in time. But you've got a very volatile and fractious market. And so we got to deal with the consequences there. But if you look at it from a value on a per share basis, we are as good, if not better than we told you we are going to be. And so I think that's really important. And then the last thing I just want to leave you with is to sort of an adjunct to what -- again, what Charles said. The whole dialogue around small customers, in part of the reason that we disclose in our prepared remarks, the amount of transactions we did it to give you a sense of just the volume of activity. And so we did 4,200 transactions, again, with 3,000 customers. As we said in the last quarter, our pipeline is as strong as it's ever been. And in fact, I said it was healthy this quarter. It's actually we -- our pipeline is bigger this quarter than it was last quarter. And so we're really optimistic about the business and where we position ourselves and we can continue to drive value into the overall equation. And again, we're long-term focused, we want to drive value into the investor and we're very much focused on AFFO per share.\nSimon Flannery: Right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Rollins from Citi. Go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Hi, good afternoon. First, on the stabilized constant currency revenue growth 7% year-over-year, can you unpack that in terms of what was driving the strength between whether it was utilization, just overall pricing, interconnection, et cetera? And then, second topic is on capital allocation. And just curious in the wake of higher rates, if you're considering any changes to the pace and breadth of the development strategy. And as the AFFO dollars are approaching the combination of non-recurring CapEx and the cash dividends, what does Equinix want to do with the balance sheet flexibility that you were describing earlier in the call? Thanks.\nCharles Meyers: Yes, I'll let Mike to -- I mean now let Keith take second part of that, Mike, and then let me talk a little bit about stabilized assets. And you can talk a little bit more on the balance sheet side and rates et cetera. But the -- look, it was a tremendous quarter obviously on stabilized assets. 7% is particularly strong. There is still a little bit of juice in there on the Singapore piece, but it was -- but it's definitely even without that significantly above kind of where we've been trending. And I think it's kind of a combination of all those factors that you're seeing pricing at interconnection, utilization, power density, all of those things probably really playing in. So -- and I think you're starting to now see the beginnings of seeing price actions. You're not seeing the PPIs, the power price increases, because those will roll through in '23. But as we've talked about, we are -- we've already adjusted list pricing on a number of our products. You're starting to see that roll through in renewals, and you're seeing it on other products that are around interconnection, et cetera. And so I think you're starting to see that as you saw, broadly speaking, utilization is trending up nicely. In fact, if you look over the last four quarters, EMEA and APAC are both up 5%. And so Europe is down about 2%, but a lot of capacity added in that region, right? And so I think we're continuing to get more out of the assets that we've deployed, continuing to feel very good about the pricing environment, continuing to dense people up driving good commercial decisions. And I think that's really showing up in the stabilized assets. We also had a couple of retired assets, that in there, they're probably also further ramp. And then the last piece, I would say is churn continue to trend. We haven't talked a lot about that. But boy, I think we've always said, look, the right to -- get the right customer, right application, right asset, that's the way to drive churn down. And I think we've seen that affect over the last -- many quarters, and continue to feel really good about that. We had obviously elevated levels to churn in the Verizon assets, which I think was really impacting our stabilized asset performance for a period of time, and have now really come through the back end of that really nicely. And I think feel really good about -- I candidly, I'm like -- I'm not sure that current level is, that's a little above the range that we've typically guided you guys to, but we will certainly take it and are pleased with the performance.\nKeith Taylor: And, Michael, just going to the -- maybe just a couple of things. One of the things that you've probably noted in our same-store reporting in the earnings deck is you can see that a lot of the value on a stabilized basis is coming from colocation and interconnection. In fact, interconnection on a stabilized basis is up 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, whereas colocation is up 7%. It's been diluted a little bit by the other services, which is only up 5%. And then nonrecurring is down quarter-over-quarter largely because of the one-off nonrecurring fees that we get from the xScale business. But overall, you're seeing the strong -- just to validate what all that Charles said, it's just you can see it in that slide just perfectly. As it relates to the balance sheet, if you wouldn't mind, I would like you to reframe the question just one last time. I want to make sure we get it right and respond to. So could you just ask that question again on where we are vis-\u00e0-vis our capital allocation?\nMichael Rollins: Yes, thanks. And it was two parts. First, if you're considering any changes to the pace and breadth of your development strategy in the wake of higher rates. And then as the AFFO dollars are approaching the combination of the nonrecurring CapEx and the cash dividend, what do you want to do with the flexibility on the balance sheet that you were describing earlier in the call?\nKeith Taylor: Yes. So thank you on that. So first and foremost, I think we fancy ourselves as pretty darn good capital allocators. We -- also we want to invest in the highest returning investment we can make as in the organic business, and we're going to continue to focus on that. No surprise, this quarter, we have 46 projects currently underway across 31 markets in 21 countries. So we remain very active and we want to continue to grow and expand the business horizontally. At the same time investing quite openly on the vertical side of the investment, which is digital services. So you're going to see a combination of the two and as we look into 2023 we will give you more guide on that. But suffice it to say that we -- there is an appetite to continue to invest in the business. And we really get to enjoy the cash flows we generate in the business, and low payout ratio to basically self fund that for all intents and purposes. So I feel extremely good about that. As you look forward, then, again, we are trying a little bit excess cash right now. We saw an opportunity in the market, in the quarter, pardon me, to pull down a little bit of our ATM. And so we settled some stuff that we did in Q2 this quarter. And then we also we sold some in the quarter in and of itself at 690 -- I think the average was $697 a share. And so we chose to do that because we knew we're going into periods of volatility. And we wanted to make sure that we could fully effect the use of our cash flow and invest in the long-term growth of business, which is really an expansion capital, while also investing in digital services. So that's what you're going to continue to hear us talk about. And then we're also being very judicious about -- I've spoken quite openly about we want to raise more debt even in the current environment. But the question is, where do we source that debt from? And can we take advantage of different markets around the world based on prevailing cost to borrow? That's all -- you'll hear more about that. But suffice it to say, I think you'll see more debt activity over the coming quarters than otherwise. You'd see with ATM. And then just as it relates to investment and capital, yes, I know the cost of capital is moving up. But we -- the benefit of our model is and for all the reasons you just heard Charles speak about, we get a really good return on our assets, our stabilized assets are getting 29% on them and on a gross PP&E invested. So anytime we increment that, knowing that we're keeping our costs well in check here, that you're going to get a nice incremental return. And so from our perspective, we're not arbitraging over our cost of capital. We're driving real value into the business for our customers and for the future. And as a result, we want to continue to make that investment. And we'll be very wise about what we raise in the form of capital to fund our growth, knowing that you've got a dividend that's growing, and you've got a business that's growing. And as a result, we got to fund not only the business and also the capital redeployment back to the investor. So I think it's a great question you're asking. We spent a lot of energy on it. I've got a fantastic treasury team that work underneath us. And we're looking at all ways to source our capital and fund value on a per share basis to the business. And so stay tuned.\nCharles Meyers: Mike, the -- you guys are pushing a lot of the buttons here. So I want to offer an anecdote that I think is really powerful. And that is kind of when I'm out and talking to customers and with sales teams, it's pretty amazing. Because what I hear from sales teams, their number one concern, not enough capacity. They're like -- we're worried, we're going to run out of capacity we need, are you building more capacity? I'm not hearing, hey, what are you going to do to my quota is next year? We know the answer to that question. I'm not hearing, hey, passing through these power increases is challenging. What I'm hearing is, we need more capacity, we need to continue to invest in the business. When are we going to get more coverage on digital services, I want to cover more markets. We need to respond to our customers' needs. And so, I think it's just a reflection, we\u2019re pushing utilization up, that's starting to create some pinch points. And so, from our perspective, as we look at how the business is performing, continue to invest in organic growth prudently and appropriately. And always in with a keen eye on the macro environment. It's still best and highest and best use for us.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Barden from Bank of America. Go ahead. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. This is [indiscernible] for Dave. Just, Charles, maybe just on those comments that you just made in terms of building out more capacity. Are you seeing any issues just similar to what's going on in Northern Virginia and other areas of the world of power transmission issues or power procurement issues?\nCharles Meyers: Yes, it's a great question. The answer is, yes. I mean, I think you're seeing that. Markets around the world are thinking about how to allocate energy. They're also thinking about the sustainability impacts of data centers in their markets, and how they want to sort of -- how they want to think about providing energy and permitting to support those, et cetera. So obviously, that's a key area of focus for us. I do think that overall, we're in a very good position. I think that not only do we have really well established relationships across those markets, we have a level of commitment. And I think specification on the sustainability side, that people I think feel comfortable that we are going to make the commitments necessary to support digital transformation in their markets, and digital growth in their markets in a way that's responsible. And so I think that's going to continue to be a differentiation for us. But we could -- and the other thing is, is that our market -- or our business and our business model are very different when it comes to power. They need to support, for example, a hyperscale facility that's going to support one or two customers and allocating that power entirely to those is very different than the power situation we find ourselves in. We have a much greater level of flexibility in terms of looking at how we're using power, moving a power around over time. And so I think there's some additional flexibility for us there. But the short answer is, yes, that is a dynamic that I think is not unique to Northern Virginia. We feel very good about where we are in that market, by the way, just in terms of our position there. But it is something that I think is going to be on people's minds. And I think we're -- on the capacity question, we're even seeing that churn -- people who were planning churn are now unplanning it. And because I think they feel like they -- that had an ensuring that they have capacity and sometimes under existing terms, or something that is close to those existing terms is a strategic decision for them. And I think we're continuing to see favorability in churn for those reasons.\nUnidentified Analyst: Perfect, thank you. And then maybe if I could just ask one more. Just you completed Entel and then you announced a smaller deal on Latin America. Do you just kind of walk us through the Latin America strategy and where you kind of see that, that business going?\nCharles Meyers: Sure. Generally, I would say that we feel like that the Chile edition with Entel was our strategic one that sort of fills out the LatAm portfolio in a really powerful way. And so I think we feel good about the level of coverage that we have there. That's not to say there wouldn't be potentially incremental opportunities there. But our businesses in Brazil -- our business in Brazil continues to thrive. Obviously, current -- market currency wise, it can be challenging and has been for years. But the growth there has been really strong, and our differentiated position in that market continues to be very good. So I think that continue to invest in that business. We're happy with the early returns on our business in Mexico. As Keith said, we've made some investments there for land and continue to see that as a -- with additional market opportunity there. Excited about the early returns. And that's one of the things we see on these businesses. We underwrite them to a certain level of performance. And almost always we're seeing that the power of bringing those assets into our channel -- our channel, broadly speaking mean, our direct teams and our partners and giving them access to those, we are hit -- we're really typically hitting bookings velocities that are much better than what we underwrote too. And so, we feel good about that. But yes, I think we feel good about LatAm. I think there's potentially incremental opportunity. But if I were to prioritize where I think we were more likely to make incremental M&A activity, it would be in probably maybe some other parts of the world. And we've talked about those in a variety of places. Southeast Asia, I think is continuing to reshape a bit and is a market that both organically and potentially through M&A, we would find attractive. India is a market that I think we will continue to invest in organically and potentially inorganically. And obviously, we've got a starting point in Africa that we are very excited about. But there's more potentially to do there. So I think that's -- I kind of went a little beyond your question there, but that's a little bit of a frame on the M&A world.\nUnidentified Analyst: That's great. Thanks so much, Charles.\nOperator: Next question is from Aryeh Klein from BMO Capital Markets. Go ahead. Your line is open.\nAryeh Klein: Thank you. Maybe following up on churn, it's been low for a while here, as we move into potentially tougher macro and you ask customers to absorb kind of the forefront [ph] to the price increases. Is that something that, that you would expect to tick up?\nCharles Meyers: No. So, I mean, we really don't see that. I think that we've seen: one, I think the history of our business and this is a pretty empirically validated is that our demand tends to be pretty inelastic. And so I think that's likely to be particularly true relative to the power price increases, which I believe in hope will be at least to some degree, transitory. Now, whether or not we get back to energy level pricing levels that were -- we were at before, I don't know. But I think that -- I don't -- we don't currently see that as a driver for people to say, oh, well, we're going to churn out of our capacity. So I think it increases the level of focus that people have on efficient utilization of the capacity they have deployed. And I think they see that same dynamic a little bit in cloud, right, which is people are saying, hey, we got to tighten up on our cloud bills, we got to -- we're going to reduce usage on non-mission critical workloads. And I think you're seeing some of that impact in that business. Our business is much more on fixed contracts. We're starting -- we have a little bit of usage based revenue in some of our digital services. But I don't foresee us ticking up in churn in any meaningful way as a result of sort of the pricing adjustments. I think that we're going to continue to see people very committed to their digital transformation. I think like -- that will be an element of inflationary forces that our customers are going to deal with, much like we and every other company is dealing with out there. But I think it boils down to kind of how you -- what priorities you place, and we really feel like digital transformation, and the move to hybrid and multi cloud is, as I -- as we said in the script, both a revenue maximizing driver and a cost driver, in many cases, in terms of doing more with less. So we feel like the demand profile is going to continue to be strong. And again, our ability to forecast churn has been very, very good. And so we're not going into that blind. We continue to have confidence there. But we'll have to continue to monitor very, very closely and see how the market responds. But I think our history and an empirical data would indicate that we have a market that's pretty inelastic from a demand perspective.\nAryeh Klein: Thanks. And then, Keith, I think you mentioned some of the timing related to some spending during the quarter. Looking at Q4, the margin for the quarter are towards the lower than they've been in a long time, the implied margin. How should we think about the spending in the fourth quarter and how that may be carried into 2023?\nKeith Taylor: Well, yes, as I said in the prepared remarks, there's an element of discretionary spend that we accelerated in the quarter. I think of that in the $20 million to $30 million range, and then you've got a pretty long range in the -- and then -- in the quarterly guide. So I would say, like, look at the underlying performance, you've got some seasonal costs to that, that sort of take place in the fourth quarter that we absorbed. But overall, the business continues to perform better than we anticipated. The margin profile, or the cash generated in the businesses is stronger than we were planning. And as a result, we use that as an opportunity to accelerate costs, and put us in a pretty good spot as we start to think about 2023.\nCharles Meyers: Just to give you a little more transparency on, so -- what some of those are, we're pulling forward some R&M [ph], pulling forward -- just finishing out some projects that we are focused on both on the go-to-market side, and on the product side to -- to really give us that, the momentum going into next year. We gave a little bit more -- little wider berth to the teams on T&E in Q4. Because we really continue to believe that getting our teams reconnected both to our customers and to each other is important. And I think we're really seeing the dividends of that. And so -- but we're -- we definitely have not lost the plot in terms of our focus on operating leverage. In fact, if you look at our SG&A line, it's flat quarter-to-quarter and that's in the face of increasing investment in sales and marketing. And so that implies that we're sort of tightening down on G&A. And, even though, we're adding headcount in very targeted areas to support a very healthy organic performance of our business, we're also really tightening down in areas of the business in recognizing that we continue -- have to continue to have a focus on automation and simplification and efficiency. And we got to get that G&A leverage that we need in the business over time. So, we -- there's -- we're trying to make good balanced decisions on that front. And, again, we'll give you more perspective and cover what that means. But feeling very good about the trajectory of the business as we exit towards the end of the year.\nAryeh Klein: Okay. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: The next question is from Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. Go ahead. Your lines open.\nSami Badri: Thank you. Keith, earlier, you said that you have been having conversations with your customers regarding those PIs. And you said that you have been sharing with them some ranges. I was hoping you could kind of share with us what those ranges actually are, just so we have an idea of magnitude when we enter 2023. And then I think there was a question about general activity and trends. And I apologize if this is a duplicative question, but the tech sector is reporting some elongated lead times and some sales cycles extending to a certain degree, there are even IT budgets to require Board level approvals, which are just slowing some things down. I was hoping you could tell us if that -- those are the things that you're seeing or not at this stage. And then I have one follow-up.\nKeith Taylor: Okay. Well, let me maybe just start with the ranges. So first and foremost, we want to have a go-to-market engine, the customer facing teams wanted to have some dialogue with the customers on sort of power increases. And so first of all, it was really everybody is seeing what's going on in the broader market, particularly in Europe. And as a result, making sure that you're sort of advising the customers that there is going to be effective power increase at some point. The second value was effectively, look, depending on where you are, one market is very, very different than other markets. Some are regulated, some are unregulated. This is the sort of the range that you should expect. As both Charles and I have mentioned, we've got a sophisticated hedging program. We basically solidified what we think is a good portion of exposure for next year. And so we have specific information on that. And so we give them a range of what that could be. And again, as market specific, is volume-specific as application specific, again, customers, there's going to be a wide range for these customers depending on where they operate. And the third value will be in the not-too-distant future here is your specific increase. And so part of it is just making sure that the customer is fully understood that we're communicating with them. And we got it with -- and we give them enough time to understand what was going to happen, particularly as they start to think about their -- sorry, 2023 planning cycle. And so that was -- that's the first part. To give you something specific about what -- look, I could tell you, in some markets, if you look at spot, you're talking about multiples of increase, particularly in the U.K. market. That's not where we are as a company. We've done a very good job of buying forward and making sure we have a good position with. And I think our customers, as we said, we think we will be in a better spot relative to our competition. and we will be certainly well below what I think prevailing market rates are. So that's the positive. That is a European discussion. As you look at Asia and Americas, it's a different dialogue. You've got a much more structured increase. And overall, I feel very good about that. I think one of the things that you should walk away though, is understanding that the company is almost wholly hedged for next year. And certainly, Europe is even more hedged than the broader company. And so that's the one thing, I think, is really worth noting here. Because last year, we had some exposure to Singapore. We feel much better where we are going into '23 on Singapore. As we said to Michael, we would go to -- come back to the market and the market would come to us and all indications is the market is coming to us. And as a result, we will pass-through those incremental costs as well. So hopefully, that helps you a little bit, Sami, but I can't give you a specific range. It's very -- it's market and customer-specific.\nCharles Meyers: We will give -- I mean, obviously, we will get more as those tighten up and as we get -- as we go into the call in February, we will give you a lot more transparency there.\nSami Badri: Yes.\nKeith Taylor: Sami, what was the second question? I think it was going to go to Charles on that one.\nCharles Meyers: Yes, it was around the general trends in extended cycles and are we seeing tighter IT budgets and those kind of things. Look, as I said, what we are seeing is generally a substantial commitment to the digital transformation agenda. And that doesn't mean people aren't seeing the need to tighten their belt on IT in other ways, but typically, we see that they are not -- they are trying very hard not to sort of distract their agenda in terms of the move to hybrid multi cloud as [indiscernible] choice. And I was just reading something from Gartner the other day in terms of just looking at how important is a particular IT project to your sort of digital agenda? And what is it going to do to impact your competitiveness to drive top line growth to save money, et cetera? And we continue to see a vigorous commitment to those kinds of things. And so -- and we have -- generally -- and Keith talked about this, both in terms of our cycles -- sales cycle and our backlog have not seen extensions of either of those things. And so sales execution has continued to be very, very good. Pipeline continues to be strong, pipeline execution and conversion continues to be strong. And so we're not saying it doesn't exist, although we're -- but what we would say is that the demand profile and how it's translating for us in bookings and pipeline is very, very good. And we're continuing to invest in the business accordingly.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you for the color on both of those. My last question is more on bare metal. And you mentioned how you have a new SaaS customer coming on using the service, and you also have a health care enterprise or a customer using service. And one of your private data center peers recently introduced a metal service and product so I kind of want to just understand what's the vision here for Equinix and the metal solution overall? Like are you guys trying to grow this 2x, 3x? Is this going to become a much more integrated or interconnected piece to everything you do? I just want to understand what the kind of the pipeline or the road map is there.\nCharles Meyers: Sure. Well, definitely, I think, it can be 2x to 3x and more than that -- than its current size, for sure. I think it can be -- so we definitely believe it's a meaningful business going forward for us. I also think we want to see it be more fully integrated. In fact, I think that is feedback we're getting from our customers is we love your individual digital services, but they don't work as effectively as an integrated platform as we would like. And so Scott, who franchise who joined us is sort of out there talking to customers, hearing what's on their mind, that has been a topic. And we're really continuing to align our product and development agenda to ensure that we are addressing the needs that the customers have. And so we do believe that an integrated platform, if you look at network edge, fabric and metal, we think that's a compelling combination of offerings for customers as they look to implement digital transformation strategies in hybrid and multi cloud. And so -- but I think it's important that we really continue to view that as giving them the right sort of portfolio of services to meet their needs. We think that actually public cloud will be a great home for a significant portion of their workloads. We definitely see sometimes repatriation back to either a colo-based solution or a metal type-based solution that allows sort of different level of economic scaling and utilization is something that happens. But we are -- we want to respond to the needs of the customer and have the right solution for them. And so when that's cloud, that's great. Move the workloads to the cloud, we will give you the connectivity you need to connect it to the data and other applications you need to have it perform well, and we will distribute that infrastructure around the world. And so, I think us being able to go in with that trusted adviser status with the customer is really what's driving the business. But we definitely see a big opportunity in metal and I think -- and with the broader digital services portfolio as continued. And as we've said in the past, it's growing at a multiple of the rate of our -- of the broader business.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And our last question today is from Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatthew Niknam: Hey, thanks for taking the question. And I'll keep it to one, because I know we're over the hour. You're tracking a 9% to 10% -- not a problem. So I know you're tracking a 9% to 10% constant currency growth on AFFO per share this year. But there's obviously headwinds from rising interest rates and higher power costs. And I know you've mentioned you intend to pass those through. But the question is really what confidence level do you have in the ability to stay within that 7% to 10% AFFO per share growth range for next year with a number of headwinds out there? Thanks.\nCharles Meyers: Sure. Clearly, we are not going to give you a sort of a guide for next year, and we will give you that early. I guess I'd sort of reposition the question to simply tell you that if you look at our performance of what we said we would do at Analyst Day -- at the Analyst Day and what we've now done, I think we continue to feel really good about the trajectory of the business. Top line growth is strong, stronger than outside of the bounds of what we had said. I think that -- and I think that's really on the strength of underlying business momentum. And so -- we feel really good about the trajectory going into next year from a top line growth standpoint, too. I think growth will be a little wind assisted on PPIs next year, but I think we will give you clear transparency on what that is. But I think it's going to be on top of really strong underlying momentum in the business. And we think that's translating into the AFFO per share sort of growth that we think is needed and attractive. And then you combine that with a healthy dividend yield -- and we think it's a great story. So generally, I would say feel good about the momentum. Top line growth is good. We are going to continue to focus on operating leverage. And we think, therefore, we are going to be able to deliver strong performance on an AFFO per share basis. Keith, anything to add there?\nKeith Taylor: And, Matt, the only other thing I would say is one of the things that, again, you talked about normalized constant currency. And so on a constant currency basis, we're taking roughly relative to where we started the year about $180 million hit to the top line because of currency movement, and about $85 million to the EBITDA line. So it gives you a sense that what we're absorbing. So the performance of the business is doing much better than we had anticipated. And you can see that coming in so many different places, including the Americas business. I think when the -- I think the other thing that's going to certainly aid many of us, particularly those that are U.S. domiciled, as currencies start to move the other direction, which I suspect that they will at some point, that you're also going to get wind at your back from currency. So not only do you have the momentum coming from what Charles alluded to, but I also think that you've got -- you're going to have currency movement when other -- where other sort of central banks move their rates up to the U.S. or the U.S. starts to slow down on their rate increase. And that's going to be, I think, a real benefit to the business. And as I said before, if you just take our top three currencies, you take them back to our traditional parity level, not a deviation higher or lower, I mean you're really talking about a significant increase in revenues just from currency movements. Of course, we hedge ourselves and we do a really good job of currency hedging. But I wanted to leave you with that thought as well. It's not just about the pure execution to the business on how we are operating it, but also there's some currency movement that I think is going to benefit us as well.\nMatthew Niknam: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nCharles Meyers: Thanks, Matt.\nKatrina Rymill: Thank you. That concludes our Q3 call. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: That concludes our conference. Thank you for participating.

            "name": "Keith Taylor",
            "content": "Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. As you can see from our results, the Equinix team continues to execute for our customers, our communities and for our investors. Our go-to-market engine delivered record gross and net bookings in Q3, closing over 4,200 deals with more than 3,000 customers. Our success is derived from the breadth of our service offerings, the scale of our growing platform, the quality of our operations organization and the focus of our investing for the longer term. For the quarter, our net bookings performance moved up significantly, both compared to our Q3 expectations and the same quarter last year due to strong growth activity, a favorable pricing environment, lower-than-expected churn and the strength of our digital services offerings. Again, we had net positive pricing actions. Consequently, our consolidated MRR per cabinet increased to greater than $2,000 per cabinet despite the weaker foreign operating currencies. And note the expected price increases or PPI discussed by Charles are not in either are reported or are guided numbers. These price increases will be passed through to our customers in 2023. Over the past couple of months, we've been communicating with our customers about the pending power price increases. And most recently, we've notified them of the expected range of their power cost increase at the market level. The dialogue with our customers highlighted the value of our multiyear power planning and sourcing efforts, which is expected to meaningfully dampen the impact of inflated energy costs to many of our customers, both relative to the competition and the broader market. Finally, notwithstanding of strong bookings performance in Q3, our forward looking pipeline remains healthy. And our backlog and our book-to-bill interval remains constant, allowing us to remain confident as we look ahead into Q4 and plan for 2023. So given the momentum in our business, we're again raising our underlying guidance across each of our core financial metrics for the year. Now, while our business remains well-positioned and resilient, we continue to keep macro factors top of mind. Consequently, we chose to increase the liquidity position of the company. At quarter end, we had over $2.5 billion of unrestricted cash in our bank accounts, and full access to our $4 billion line of credit, increasing the financial and operational flexibility of the business. Our net leverage remains low at 3.5x our adjusted EBITDA, creating plenty of balance sheet flexibility. Now let me cover the highlights for the quarter. Note that all comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, Global Q3 revenues were $1.841 billion, up 11% over the same quarter last year, above the top end of our guidance range on an FX neutral basis, largely due to strong recurring revenues. Q3 through revenues net of our FX hedges included a $9 million impact when compared to our prior guidance rates, largely due to weaker euro and British pounds. Global Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $871 million or 47% of revenues, up 11% of the same quarter last year, above the top end of our guidance range due to strong cash flows profit and lower than planned operating costs, including professional fees and consulting costs. Q3 adjusted EBITDA net of our FX hedges included a $5 million FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates, and $4 million of integration costs. Global Q3 AFFO was $712 million, above our expectations due to strong operating performance and lower net interest expense and included a $5 million FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 MRR churn was 1.9%, a continued reflection of our disciplined sales execution to put the right customer with the right application into the right asset. For Q4, we expect MRR churn to continue to trend at the lower end of our 2% to 2.5% per quarter range. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. APAC was the fastest growing region on a year-over-year normalized MRR basis at 19%, followed by the Americas and EMEA regions at 11% and 10%, respectively. The Americas region had another great quarter of a strong gross bookings, lower MRR churn and favorable pricing trends led by our Washington DC and New York metros. In August we added Lima, Peru to our platform as part of the Entel acquisition expanding our Latin American footprint, our fifth country and extending the Equinix platform to 32 countries and 71 markets globally. Our EMEA region delivered another record bookings quarter with strong pricing and robust channel activity, led by our Amsterdam, Dublin and Frankfurt markets with strength in our IT services and enterprise verticals. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a strong quarter with robust exports from Japan. As part of our future-first sustainability strategy, we're very proud to announce a partnership with the Center for Energy Research and Technology at the National University of Singapore to explore sustainable technologies and alternate fuel sources for data center infrastructure. And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our balance sheet increased slightly despite the weaker non-U.S operating currencies to $29.3 billion, including an unrestricted cash balance of $2.5 billion. Our cash balance increased quarter-over-quarter due to strong operating cash flow, and about $800 million of ATM activity settled in the quarter. As stated previously, we'll continue to take a balanced and opportunistic approach to accessing the capital markets when conditions are favorable. On the debt side of the house, on the heels of the rating upgrades from both Fitch and Moody's last quarter, S&P increased their debt tolerance for the company by one leverage turn, thereby increasing the level of flexibility from our balance sheet. We're pleased and appreciative of the rating improvements over the past quarters. I look forward to our continued dialogue with our rating agencies. Turning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $553 million, including a recurring CapEx of $50 million. In the quarter, we opened 6 retail projects in Istanbul, Madrid, Manchester, Melbourne, Paris and Toronto, and 2 xScale projects in Frankfurt and London. We also purchase land for development in Monterrey, Mexico. Our capital investments deliver strong returns as shown on Slide 10. A 160 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 7% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are now collectively 88% utilized, and generate a 29% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for a updated summary of 2022 guidance and bridges, including the anticipated financial results from the Entel, Peru purchase. For the full year 2022, due to strong momentum that we're seeing in the organic business, we now expect our revenues to increase between 10% and 11% on a normalizing constant currency basis over the prior year. Relative to our prior guidance, we're increasing our underlying revenues by $15 million due to strong recurring revenue performance. We expect 2022 underlying adjusted EBITDA that increased by $46 million compared to our prior guidance due to strong revenue performance and more operating spend. We now expect to incur $20 million of integration costs in 2022. We're raising our underlying 2022 AFFO by $52 million to grow between 10% and 11% on a normalized and constant currency basis, due to strong operating performance, and lower net interest expense. And as a result, our AFFO per share is now expected to grow between 9% and 10% on a normalized and constant currency basis, above the top end of our prior guide, including the impact from our Q3 ATM activity. Finally, 2022 CapEx is now expected to range between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion, including about $190 million of recurring CapEx and about $135 million of on balance sheet xScale spin, down slightly due to timing of expansion spent. So let me stop here. I'm going to turn the call back to Charles. So, Jon, I'll take the first one, I think I'll pass the second one to Charles. It's roughly 13%. Again, it moves around quarter-on-quarter and it's also dependent on,-in some cases, the currency movements. But for this year, you should see the range anywhere sort of from 12% to 13% on a per revenue dollar basis. And, Simon, let me just add a couple of other quick points, if I may in addition to what Charles said. First and foremost, the objective to get to 50% margin targets, as sort of Charles alluded to, we're doing better than we anticipated in the Americas. Singapore is better than anticipated. And overall, we're running the business with a great deal of discipline. And I say that with emphasis. And so number one, we're seeing margin profile that's better than you might have otherwise anticipated. Two, when you sort of look into the fourth quarter, we're making some discretionary decisions to accelerate costs into the fourth quarter. But after that we continue to drive the business with greater efficiency. As it relates to the 50% EBITDA margin target, just I've said this on a number of -- in a number of non-deal roadshows, and one-on-one discussions with investors. We're not shifting our emphasis to 50% EBITDA. We believe that we can get there. In fact, the performance of the business post the Analyst Day, we're actually doing better than we thought than we anticipated at that point in time. But you've got a very volatile and fractious market. And so we got to deal with the consequences there. But if you look at it from a value on a per share basis, we are as good, if not better than we told you we are going to be. And so I think that's really important. And then the last thing I just want to leave you with is to sort of an adjunct to what -- again, what Charles said. The whole dialogue around small customers, in part of the reason that we disclose in our prepared remarks, the amount of transactions we did it to give you a sense of just the volume of activity. And so we did 4,200 transactions, again, with 3,000 customers. As we said in the last quarter, our pipeline is as strong as it's ever been. And in fact, I said it was healthy this quarter. It's actually we -- our pipeline is bigger this quarter than it was last quarter. And so we're really optimistic about the business and where we position ourselves and we can continue to drive value into the overall equation. And again, we're long-term focused, we want to drive value into the investor and we're very much focused on AFFO per share. And, Michael, just going to the -- maybe just a couple of things. One of the things that you've probably noted in our same-store reporting in the earnings deck is you can see that a lot of the value on a stabilized basis is coming from colocation and interconnection. In fact, interconnection on a stabilized basis is up 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, whereas colocation is up 7%. It's been diluted a little bit by the other services, which is only up 5%. And then nonrecurring is down quarter-over-quarter largely because of the one-off nonrecurring fees that we get from the xScale business. But overall, you're seeing the strong -- just to validate what all that Charles said, it's just you can see it in that slide just perfectly. As it relates to the balance sheet, if you wouldn't mind, I would like you to reframe the question just one last time. I want to make sure we get it right and respond to. So could you just ask that question again on where we are vis-a\u0300-vis our capital allocation? Yes. So thank you on that. So first and foremost, I think we fancy ourselves as pretty darn good capital allocators. We -- also we want to invest in the highest returning investment we can make as in the organic business, and we're going to continue to focus on that. No surprise, this quarter, we have 46 projects currently underway across 31 markets in 21 countries. So we remain very active and we want to continue to grow and expand the business horizontally. At the same time investing quite openly on the vertical side of the investment, which is digital services. So you're going to see a combination of the two and as we look into 2023 we will give you more guide on that. But suffice it to say that we -- there is an appetite to continue to invest in the business. And we really get to enjoy the cash flows we generate in the business, and low payout ratio to basically self fund that for all intents and purposes. So I feel extremely good about that. As you look forward, then, again, we are trying a little bit excess cash right now. We saw an opportunity in the market, in the quarter, pardon me, to pull down a little bit of our ATM. And so we settled some stuff that we did in Q2 this quarter. And then we also we sold some in the quarter in and of itself at 690 -- I think the average was $697 a share. And so we chose to do that because we knew we're going into periods of volatility. And we wanted to make sure that we could fully effect the use of our cash flow and invest in the long-term growth of business, which is really an expansion capital, while also investing in digital services. So that's what you're going to continue to hear us talk about. And then we're also being very judicious about -- I've spoken quite openly about we want to raise more debt even in the current environment. But the question is, where do we source that debt from? And can we take advantage of different markets around the world based on prevailing cost to borrow? That's all -- you'll hear more about that. But suffice it to say, I think you'll see more debt activity over the coming quarters than otherwise. You'd see with ATM. And then just as it relates to investment and capital, yes, I know the cost of capital is moving up. But we -- the benefit of our model is and for all the reasons you just heard Charles speak about, we get a really good return on our assets, our stabilized assets are getting 29% on them and on a gross PP&E invested. So anytime we increment that, knowing that we're keeping our costs well in check here, that you're going to get a nice incremental return. And so from our perspective, we're not arbitraging over our cost of capital. We're driving real value into the business for our customers and for the future. And as a result, we want to continue to make that investment. And we'll be very wise about what we raise in the form of capital to fund our growth, knowing that you've got a dividend that's growing, and you've got a business that's growing. And as a result, we got to fund not only the business and also the capital redeployment back to the investor. So I think it's a great question you're asking. We spent a lot of energy on it. I've got a fantastic treasury team that work underneath us. And we're looking at all ways to source our capital and fund value on a per share basis to the business. And so stay tuned. Well, yes, as I said in the prepared remarks, there's an element of discretionary spend that we accelerated in the quarter. I think of that in the $20 million to $30 million range, and then you've got a pretty long range in the -- and then -- in the quarterly guide. So I would say, like, look at the underlying performance, you've got some seasonal costs to that, that sort of take place in the fourth quarter that we absorbed. But overall, the business continues to perform better than we anticipated. The margin profile, or the cash generated in the businesses is stronger than we were planning. And as a result, we use that as an opportunity to accelerate costs, and put us in a pretty good spot as we start to think about 2023. Okay. Well, let me maybe just start with the ranges. So first and foremost, we want to have a go-to-market engine, the customer facing teams wanted to have some dialogue with the customers on sort of power increases. And so first of all, it was really everybody is seeing what's going on in the broader market, particularly in Europe. And as a result, making sure that you're sort of advising the customers that there is going to be effective power increase at some point. The second value was effectively, look, depending on where you are, one market is very, very different than other markets. Some are regulated, some are unregulated. This is the sort of the range that you should expect. As both Charles and I have mentioned, we've got a sophisticated hedging program. We basically solidified what we think is a good portion of exposure for next year. And so we have specific information on that. And so we give them a range of what that could be. And again, as market specific, is volume-specific as application specific, again, customers, there's going to be a wide range for these customers depending on where they operate. And the third value will be in the not-too-distant future here is your specific increase. And so part of it is just making sure that the customer is fully understood that we're communicating with them. And we got it with -- and we give them enough time to understand what was going to happen, particularly as they start to think about their -- sorry, 2023 planning cycle. And so that was -- that's the first part. To give you something specific about what -- look, I could tell you, in some markets, if you look at spot, you're talking about multiples of increase, particularly in the U.K. market. That's not where we are as a company. We've done a very good job of buying forward and making sure we have a good position with. And I think our customers, as we said, we think we will be in a better spot relative to our competition. and we will be certainly well below what I think prevailing market rates are. So that's the positive. That is a European discussion. As you look at Asia and Americas, it's a different dialogue. You've got a much more structured increase. And overall, I feel very good about that. I think one of the things that you should walk away though, is understanding that the company is almost wholly hedged for next year. And certainly, Europe is even more hedged than the broader company. And so that's the one thing, I think, is really worth noting here. Because last year, we had some exposure to Singapore. We feel much better where we are going into '23 on Singapore. As we said to Michael, we would go to -- come back to the market and the market would come to us and all indications is the market is coming to us. And as a result, we will pass-through those incremental costs as well. So hopefully, that helps you a little bit, Sami, but I can't give you a specific range. It's very -- it's market and customer-specific. Sami, what was the second question? I think it was going to go to Charles on that one. And, Matt, the only other thing I would say is one of the things that, again, you talked about normalized constant currency. And so on a constant currency basis, we're taking roughly relative to where we started the year about $180 million hit to the top line because of currency movement, and about $85 million to the EBITDA line. So it gives you a sense that what we're absorbing. So the performance of the business is doing much better than we had anticipated. And you can see that coming in so many different places, including the Americas business. I think when the -- I think the other thing that's going to certainly aid many of us, particularly those that are U.S. domiciled, as currencies start to move the other direction, which I suspect that they will at some point, that you're also going to get wind at your back from currency. So not only do you have the momentum coming from what Charles alluded to, but I also think that you've got -- you're going to have currency movement when other -- where other sort of central banks move their rates up to the U.S. or the U.S. starts to slow down on their rate increase. And that's going to be, I think, a real benefit to the business. And as I said before, if you just take our top three currencies, you take them back to our traditional parity level, not a deviation higher or lower, I mean you're really talking about a significant increase in revenues just from currency movements. Of course, we hedge ourselves and we do a really good job of currency hedging. But I wanted to leave you with that thought as well. It's not just about the pure execution to the business on how we are operating it, but also there's some currency movement that I think is going to benefit us as well."

            "name": "Charles Meyers",
            "content": "Thanks, Katrina. Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We had another outstanding quarter as global demand for digital infrastructure continues to grow, and customer preferences trend convincingly toward architectures that are highly distributed, persistently hybrid, deeply cloud connected and increasingly on demand. All factors fueling the Equinix position as a trusted partner in digital transformation. This vigorous demand backdrop fueled another great quarter, delivering record gross and net bookings, with strong demand across all three regions, resulting in our 79th quarter of consecutive revenue growth and further demonstrating the resiliency and durability of our business, even in the face of a complex and challenging macro environment. It is increasingly evident that the global pandemic has been a catalyst for a fundamental shift in how customers view digital transformation and its importance as a strategic imperative. And this commitment to digital transformation continues even in the face of a broader dynamic of belt tightening, as companies look to do more with less and see digital as a catalyst to both maximize revenues and optimize costs. While we continue to closely monitor macro conditions and adapt our execution accordingly, the fundamentals of our business remain exceptionally strong. Our expansive global reach and robust interconnected ecosystems continue to attract a wide and diverse customer set as they prioritize digital investments, and embrace platform Equinix as a point of nexus to support hybrid and multi cloud. This wave of digital infrastructure demand and our highly differentiated value proposition are translating to a robust pipeline, a highly favorable pricing environment and low churn, all fueling record performance across the business year-to-date and setting us up for a strong trajectory as we look to 2023 and beyond. As customers navigate rising interest rates and broad based inflation, they're benefiting from our scale purchasing power and our sophisticated capabilities in hedging, risk management and sustainability. Our operating scale and scope give us a variety of levers to manage an increasingly dynamic environment, hedging currency, power and interest rates, investing in advanced procurement teams, expanding renewables coverage and taking a programmatic approach to improving the efficiency of our world-class data centers, an advanced set of capabilities supported by a strong and flexible balance sheet. Specifically, on power, we have had a keen focus in this area and continue to feel confident in our position. Our approach to multiyear hedging is affording Equinix the visibility and predictability to communicate to customers in advance of expected power price increases, and is allowing us to deliver cost points to customers that remain highly favorable against spot rates in many markets, as volatility persists. While our aim remains to dampen this volatility for our customers through hedging, we do expect meaningful increases in power costs in many markets, and per our contracts, the full impact of these additional power costs will be passed on to customers. Overall, we believe we remain in a good position relative to competitors and the broader market. Turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3. Revenues for Q3 were $1.84 billion, up 11% over the same quarter last year, driven by strong recurring revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA was up 11% year-over-year with AFFO meaningly -- meaningfully ahead of our expectations due to strong operating performance. Interconnection revenues continue to outpace the broader business growing 13% year-over-year. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Equinix continues to extend its leadership as the most interconnected platform with four on-ramp wins this quarter, bringing the total in our portfolio to more than 200 on-ramps across 44 markets. We now have 11 metros across platform Equinix enabled with on-ramps from all five of the leading cloud providers. No other competitor has more than one. In addition to placing critical networking nodes in on-ramps at Equinix, hyperscalers are also integral to our go-to-market notion as customers continue to aggressively migrate workloads to the cloud and demand cloud proximity for their own private cloud implementations. As indicated in our recently published Global Interconnection Index, current trend lines indicate that more than 80% of Global 2000 companies will be interconnecting with more than four hyperscale providers and over 30 SaaS providers or other business partners, on average by 2026. We're continuing to invest behind the momentum we're seeing in our data center services business with 46 major projects underway across 31 markets in 21 countries. We continue to build capacity under our xScale offering, including 10 ongoing xScale projects that we expect will deliver another 80 megawatts of capacity once opened. This quarter, we added six new projects, including new data center builds in Barcelona, Tokyo and our first organic build in Jakarta, Indonesia. Our new IBX in Jakarta will add a strategically important high-growth market to our platform, as we look to enable local businesses and global organizations to unleash Indonesia's digital potential. This commitment to market leading reach continues to drive our business with customers operating in all three regions, now accounting for an amazing 64% of our recurring revenues. Key customer expansions this quarter included StackPath, a leading edge computing platform provider, which expanded into Dubai and Mumbai to support the growth of its worldwide edge compute delivery and security offerings. A win with a global multinational airline leveraging Equinix to connect to their federated ecosystem of partner airlines, as well as a significant multi metro expansion with one of the world's largest custodian banks, deploying across all three regions and utilizing the full suite of Equinix digital services. On that note, our digital services portfolio saw continued momentum as companies increasingly demand infrastructure and interconnection services that can be delivered as a service and on demand. Equinix Metal had a strong bookings quarter as customers leverage flexibility and agility across multiple metros. Wins this quarter included a major design win with a global SaaS provider and a significant expansion with a leading pediatric treatment and research facility using Network Edge and Equinix fabric to create an edge hosting environment in key U.S. metros and enable seamless and high-performance connectivity to their cloud partners. In Q3, we added an incremental 7,300 interconnections and now have over 443,000 total interconnections on our platform. Equinix Fabric had another strong quarter as interconnection diversity continues to increase. Expansions this quarter included Colt Technology Services, further expanding its footprint in Europe and interconnectivity with Equinix Fabric to optimize performance for its customers, as well as the financial software tools and enterprise applications provider implementing a global network optimization project leveraging Equinix Fabric. Internet Exchange saw peak traffic up 8% quarter-over-quarter and 28% year-over-year to greater than 27 terabits per second, representing the largest peak traffic growth since prior to the pandemic. Our channel program delivered a six consecutive record quarter accounting for 37% of bookings and approximately 60% of new logos, and remains a critical vector in how we are expanding our reach and scaling our go-to-market engine. We continue to see particular strength from strategic cloud technology and systems integrator partners like AWS, Cisco, Dell, Google HPE, Infosys and Microsoft. This segment accounted for approximately half of our channel bookings, and continues to grow in both deal dollar -- deal and dollar volume. With these partners, we jointly offer a blend of IT and networking technologies that will allow customers to interconnect seamlessly with hyperscale cloud and other as a service providers, and benefit from solutions that deliver optimal performance, cost, security agility and scale across our global platform. Channel wins included a U.K insurance firm with Equinix Partner Softcat for a data center consolidation and modernization project at our London campus where technology elements from HPE, Cisco and Palo Alto Networks are being brought together in a cloud adjacent architecture, all directly interconnected to Microsoft and AWS. Now, let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results for the quarter. Thanks, Keith. Our results this quarter continue to reflect strong execution by our global team and highlight the unique position that Equinix enjoys in facilitating digital transformation. As we continue to deliver exceptional business results, I want to also highlight our significant progress in advancing our future-first sustainability commitments. This quarter, in addition to our continued investments and commandments around the environmental sustainability, we're very pleased to have launched the Equinix Foundation, an employee-driven charitable organization working to advance digital inclusion through philanthropic grant making and strategic partnerships. The foundation reflects our ongoing commitment to social sustainability. And we're excited about the work we can do to build a better, more inclusive, more sustainable world, harnessing and amplifying the passion of our people to help close the digital divide in our communities across the globe. As we advance Q4 and position for 2023, our highly differentiated position continues to drive strong momentum, robust customer demand and a deep, high quality pipeline. We're delivering sustained growth at the top line and AFFO per share, while maintaining our clear focus on driving operating leverage across our business. We continue to effectively exercise multiple growth levers including expanded market reach, enhancement of our product portfolio, accelerated new logo capture through our multi channel go-to-market engine, pricing adjustments that reflect our exceptional value, and a commitment to a bold innovation and sustainability agenda, all of which demonstrates the resilience of Platform Equinix and highlights our ability to deliver distinct and durable value to our customers and our shareholders. So let me stop there and open it up for questions. Yes. And on the PIs, Jon, the -- look, the way our contracts reads, we're not impaired in any way from putting those through -- during the -- of course, the contract. So they're not limited to when you take renewals. So just sort of backup and give you a view on, we talked a little bit about it in the script, but I think that we will give you details, more details when we do the '23 guide. But I think thanks to some really incredible work by our teams, we feel really good about where we are on that -- on the PI issue and on power generally. I think we're about 90%-plus, or more than -- well over 90% hedged in our deregulated markets, and we're going to be topping off those positions in the coming weeks and months. And we've already communicated those planned increases to customers, and are generally able, as Keith mentioned in his script, they will provide them with cost points that are meaningfully advantageous relative to current spot in those markets. So, I think we're going to -- we're in a really good position there. I think we're going to be able to pass a few. Obviously, they're not yet passed through, because we're still operating at our hedge rates from this year. But as they adjust, we've given them the advanced visibility to what they expect to see. And I think broadly speaking, they knew it was coming. And I think in a lot of cases, they're pleased to see that it's not quite as bad as they had feared it might be. Yes, Jon, I do think Cloud Repatriation does happen, but I think it's probably getting more airtime than maybe it's -- it really is appropriated. I mean, I think we're still very early in the movement of clouds from traditional IP architectures into cloud. And that's what we continue to see and well, I recognize, we did see some slowdown from the cloud providers: one, that was impacted significantly by currency. And two, I think a lot of it has -- as I look through those reports, and heard that was sort of reductions in usage base volume, what are likely sort of non-mission critical workloads. And so, I think that -- as I talked to CIOs, their commitment to moving to cloud-based architectures, their commitment to moving significant percentages of their overall workloads to public cloud, and then integrating that with private cloud infrastructure that needs to be cloud proximate is still full tilt. And, in fact, I talked to a CIO that said that they had -- just a Fortune 200 type CIO, but they had an application estate that was 4,000-plus applications. And when I asked him how many of those had been migrated to cloud, it was in the range of 200. And so a long way to go. And so, if you look at the -- just the quantum of growth that's happening in the cloud, in any given quarter, they're adding just the top five providers or adding $3 billion to $4 billion of incremental recurring revenue. And so I think it is still a long way to go. And I think that we continue to be particularly relevant as people think about the way things used to work in IT architectures, they all live nicely together in a rack next to each other in an enterprise data centre. Well, as soon as you start migrating workloads to the cloud and then trying to interface them with your data and applications that you're still managing on your own, things don't work quite the same. And that's what we're seeing in our pipeline, people are saying, hey, I've got to have my hybrid, my private cloud proximate. It's got to be distributed. The applications all have to work together. And so I think we're still going to continue to see vigorous demand for this migration to hybrid and multi cloud for the foreseeable future. Sure. There's a lot there, Simon. But let me try to cover it. And if I forget any of it, just bring it back up. But any softness, look, we are not blind to sort of the challenging macro conditions in which we're all operating, that's for sure. But I would say that our bookings trajectory, our sales execution, our pipeline, quality of pipeline, volume of pipeline, all continue to be very solid. And that is across regions, and it is across sectors. And I think that the phenomenon that I was just describing an answer to Jon's question is an exceptionally horizontal one. People just moving to these new cloud-first hybrid IT architectures and I think seeing the relevance of Equinix in that. And so, are there customer segments or types that are having more challenges? That we could get that question a lot. I do think that we're less exposed to either startups or small company, that's typically not our sweet spot of our business. We're really more on enterprise level, both service provider and enterprise architectures, and how people are rethinking those globally. And so we continue to see a strong level of demand. And so, I think we're less exposed to that, perhaps, and then maybe public cloud providers and others that on small or startup type businesses that might be impacted. In terms of power and Europe, generally, I would say our European business is performing very well. And yes, we do expect that power is going to -- and again, it hasn't yet impacted that. We haven't rolled those through. One, a couple of comments on that. One, our history is that we've rolled pricing through in interconnection. In fact, if you look at the non-financial metrics, we've increased MRR per cab in Europe, $100 over the last four quarters. And that's driven by interconnection pricing, that's driven by mix of business, et cetera, but the European business is performing very well. I do think it will create a pinch for people that they're going to have to pay for more for power. But just put that into context, we think that a lot of our customers are going to see monthly increases that are really modest dependent on how concentrated they are in highly impacted markets. But we think that even in worst cases, where people are in a high impact market, they might be impacted by, call it, 15% to 20% of their monthly bill. And so, for most people, we don't believe that is something that will impact their overall commitment to their digital transformation. But it does create, and we think -- so we think that we're going to -- to be able to continue to sustain the demand levels that we're seeing. And then the last piece on margin. Again, we're kind of what we would expect we were actually slightly ahead in Q3, of where our expectations would have been. And Singapore is actually slightly better than what we expected for the full year. But thankfully that's sort of coming to an end. This is the last quarter where we'll see that. I think we'll be able to now make the adjustments that we needed to make in terms of passing through the appropriate price increases in full, in the markets impacted beginning in 2023. As I said, I think we're going to be able to do that in a way that customers, even though they're certainly not going to applaud those price increases, I think, as they look at it, in a lot of those markets, they're feeling it as consumers and they're feeling at a very acute level. And I think they're going to realize -- they're starting to realize what I think the benefits of our hedging programs are in terms of dampening that volatility for them. Yes, I'll let Mike to -- I mean now let Keith take second part of that, Mike, and then let me talk a little bit about stabilized assets. And you can talk a little bit more on the balance sheet side and rates et cetera. But the -- look, it was a tremendous quarter obviously on stabilized assets. 7% is particularly strong. There is still a little bit of juice in there on the Singapore piece, but it was -- but it's definitely even without that significantly above kind of where we've been trending. And I think it's kind of a combination of all those factors that you're seeing pricing at interconnection, utilization, power density, all of those things probably really playing in. So -- and I think you're starting to now see the beginnings of seeing price actions. You're not seeing the PPIs, the power price increases, because those will roll through in '23. But as we've talked about, we are -- we've already adjusted list pricing on a number of our products. You're starting to see that roll through in renewals, and you're seeing it on other products that are around interconnection, et cetera. And so I think you're starting to see that as you saw, broadly speaking, utilization is trending up nicely. In fact, if you look over the last four quarters, EMEA and APAC are both up 5%. And so Europe is down about 2%, but a lot of capacity added in that region, right? And so I think we're continuing to get more out of the assets that we've deployed, continuing to feel very good about the pricing environment, continuing to dense people up driving good commercial decisions. And I think that's really showing up in the stabilized assets. We also had a couple of retired assets, that in there, they're probably also further ramp. And then the last piece, I would say is churn continue to trend. We haven't talked a lot about that. But boy, I think we've always said, look, the right to -- get the right customer, right application, right asset, that's the way to drive churn down. And I think we've seen that affect over the last -- many quarters, and continue to feel really good about that. We had obviously elevated levels to churn in the Verizon assets, which I think was really impacting our stabilized asset performance for a period of time, and have now really come through the back end of that really nicely. And I think feel really good about -- I candidly, I'm like -- I'm not sure that current level is, that's a little above the range that we've typically guided you guys to, but we will certainly take it and are pleased with the performance. Mike, the -- you guys are pushing a lot of the buttons here. So I want to offer an anecdote that I think is really powerful. And that is kind of when I'm out and talking to customers and with sales teams, it's pretty amazing. Because what I hear from sales teams, their number one concern, not enough capacity. They're like -- we're worried, we're going to run out of capacity we need, are you building more capacity? I'm not hearing, hey, what are you going to do to my quota is next year? We know the answer to that question. I'm not hearing, hey, passing through these power increases is challenging. What I'm hearing is, we need more capacity, we need to continue to invest in the business. When are we going to get more coverage on digital services, I want to cover more markets. We need to respond to our customers' needs. And so, I think it's just a reflection, we're pushing utilization up, that's starting to create some pinch points. And so, from our perspective, as we look at how the business is performing, continue to invest in organic growth prudently and appropriately. And always in with a keen eye on the macro environment. It's still best and highest and best use for us. Yes, it's a great question. The answer is, yes. I mean, I think you're seeing that. Markets around the world are thinking about how to allocate energy. They're also thinking about the sustainability impacts of data centers in their markets, and how they want to sort of -- how they want to think about providing energy and permitting to support those, et cetera. So obviously, that's a key area of focus for us. I do think that overall, we're in a very good position. I think that not only do we have really well established relationships across those markets, we have a level of commitment. And I think specification on the sustainability side, that people I think feel comfortable that we are going to make the commitments necessary to support digital transformation in their markets, and digital growth in their markets in a way that's responsible. And so I think that's going to continue to be a differentiation for us. But we could -- and the other thing is, is that our market -- or our business and our business model are very different when it comes to power. They need to support, for example, a hyperscale facility that's going to support one or two customers and allocating that power entirely to those is very different than the power situation we find ourselves in. We have a much greater level of flexibility in terms of looking at how we're using power, moving a power around over time. And so I think there's some additional flexibility for us there. But the short answer is, yes, that is a dynamic that I think is not unique to Northern Virginia. We feel very good about where we are in that market, by the way, just in terms of our position there. But it is something that I think is going to be on people's minds. And I think we're -- on the capacity question, we're even seeing that churn -- people who were planning churn are now unplanning it. And because I think they feel like they -- that had an ensuring that they have capacity and sometimes under existing terms, or something that is close to those existing terms is a strategic decision for them. And I think we're continuing to see favorability in churn for those reasons. Sure. Generally, I would say that we feel like that the Chile edition with Entel was our strategic one that sort of fills out the LatAm portfolio in a really powerful way. And so I think we feel good about the level of coverage that we have there. That's not to say there wouldn't be potentially incremental opportunities there. But our businesses in Brazil -- our business in Brazil continues to thrive. Obviously, current -- market currency wise, it can be challenging and has been for years. But the growth there has been really strong, and our differentiated position in that market continues to be very good. So I think that continue to invest in that business. We're happy with the early returns on our business in Mexico. As Keith said, we've made some investments there for land and continue to see that as a -- with additional market opportunity there. Excited about the early returns. And that's one of the things we see on these businesses. We underwrite them to a certain level of performance. And almost always we're seeing that the power of bringing those assets into our channel -- our channel, broadly speaking mean, our direct teams and our partners and giving them access to those, we are hit -- we're really typically hitting bookings velocities that are much better than what we underwrote too. And so, we feel good about that. But yes, I think we feel good about LatAm. I think there's potentially incremental opportunity. But if I were to prioritize where I think we were more likely to make incremental M&A activity, it would be in probably maybe some other parts of the world. And we've talked about those in a variety of places. Southeast Asia, I think is continuing to reshape a bit and is a market that both organically and potentially through M&A, we would find attractive. India is a market that I think we will continue to invest in organically and potentially inorganically. And obviously, we've got a starting point in Africa that we are very excited about. But there's more potentially to do there. So I think that's -- I kind of went a little beyond your question there, but that's a little bit of a frame on the M&A world. No. So, I mean, we really don't see that. I think that we've seen: one, I think the history of our business and this is a pretty empirically validated is that our demand tends to be pretty inelastic. And so I think that's likely to be particularly true relative to the power price increases, which I believe in hope will be at least to some degree, transitory. Now, whether or not we get back to energy level pricing levels that were -- we were at before, I don't know. But I think that -- I don't -- we don't currently see that as a driver for people to say, oh, well, we're going to churn out of our capacity. So I think it increases the level of focus that people have on efficient utilization of the capacity they have deployed. And I think they see that same dynamic a little bit in cloud, right, which is people are saying, hey, we got to tighten up on our cloud bills, we got to -- we're going to reduce usage on non-mission critical workloads. And I think you're seeing some of that impact in that business. Our business is much more on fixed contracts. We're starting -- we have a little bit of usage based revenue in some of our digital services. But I don't foresee us ticking up in churn in any meaningful way as a result of sort of the pricing adjustments. I think that we're going to continue to see people very committed to their digital transformation. I think like -- that will be an element of inflationary forces that our customers are going to deal with, much like we and every other company is dealing with out there. But I think it boils down to kind of how you -- what priorities you place, and we really feel like digital transformation, and the move to hybrid and multi cloud is, as I -- as we said in the script, both a revenue maximizing driver and a cost driver, in many cases, in terms of doing more with less. So we feel like the demand profile is going to continue to be strong. And again, our ability to forecast churn has been very, very good. And so we're not going into that blind. We continue to have confidence there. But we'll have to continue to monitor very, very closely and see how the market responds. But I think our history and an empirical data would indicate that we have a market that's pretty inelastic from a demand perspective. Just to give you a little more transparency on, so -- what some of those are, we're pulling forward some R&M [ph], pulling forward -- just finishing out some projects that we are focused on both on the go-to-market side, and on the product side to -- to really give us that, the momentum going into next year. We gave a little bit more -- little wider berth to the teams on T&E in Q4. Because we really continue to believe that getting our teams reconnected both to our customers and to each other is important. And I think we're really seeing the dividends of that. And so -- but we're -- we definitely have not lost the plot in terms of our focus on operating leverage. In fact, if you look at our SG&A line, it's flat quarter-to-quarter and that's in the face of increasing investment in sales and marketing. And so that implies that we're sort of tightening down on G&A. And, even though, we're adding headcount in very targeted areas to support a very healthy organic performance of our business, we're also really tightening down in areas of the business in recognizing that we continue -- have to continue to have a focus on automation and simplification and efficiency. And we got to get that G&A leverage that we need in the business over time. So, we -- there's -- we're trying to make good balanced decisions on that front. And, again, we'll give you more perspective and cover what that means. But feeling very good about the trajectory of the business as we exit towards the end of the year. We will give -- I mean, obviously, we will get more as those tighten up and as we get -- as we go into the call in February, we will give you a lot more transparency there. Yes, it was around the general trends in extended cycles and are we seeing tighter IT budgets and those kind of things. Look, as I said, what we are seeing is generally a substantial commitment to the digital transformation agenda. And that doesn't mean people aren't seeing the need to tighten their belt on IT in other ways, but typically, we see that they are not -- they are trying very hard not to sort of distract their agenda in terms of the move to hybrid multi cloud as [indiscernible] choice. And I was just reading something from Gartner the other day in terms of just looking at how important is a particular IT project to your sort of digital agenda? And what is it going to do to impact your competitiveness to drive top line growth to save money, et cetera? And we continue to see a vigorous commitment to those kinds of things. And so -- and we have -- generally -- and Keith talked about this, both in terms of our cycles -- sales cycle and our backlog have not seen extensions of either of those things. And so sales execution has continued to be very, very good. Pipeline continues to be strong, pipeline execution and conversion continues to be strong. And so we're not saying it doesn't exist, although we're -- but what we would say is that the demand profile and how it's translating for us in bookings and pipeline is very, very good. And we're continuing to invest in the business accordingly. Sure. Well, definitely, I think, it can be 2x to 3x and more than that -- than its current size, for sure. I think it can be -- so we definitely believe it's a meaningful business going forward for us. I also think we want to see it be more fully integrated. In fact, I think that is feedback we're getting from our customers is we love your individual digital services, but they don't work as effectively as an integrated platform as we would like. And so Scott, who franchise who joined us is sort of out there talking to customers, hearing what's on their mind, that has been a topic. And we're really continuing to align our product and development agenda to ensure that we are addressing the needs that the customers have. And so we do believe that an integrated platform, if you look at network edge, fabric and metal, we think that's a compelling combination of offerings for customers as they look to implement digital transformation strategies in hybrid and multi cloud. And so -- but I think it's important that we really continue to view that as giving them the right sort of portfolio of services to meet their needs. We think that actually public cloud will be a great home for a significant portion of their workloads. We definitely see sometimes repatriation back to either a colo-based solution or a metal type-based solution that allows sort of different level of economic scaling and utilization is something that happens. But we are -- we want to respond to the needs of the customer and have the right solution for them. And so when that's cloud, that's great. Move the workloads to the cloud, we will give you the connectivity you need to connect it to the data and other applications you need to have it perform well, and we will distribute that infrastructure around the world. And so, I think us being able to go in with that trusted adviser status with the customer is really what's driving the business. But we definitely see a big opportunity in metal and I think -- and with the broader digital services portfolio as continued. And as we've said in the past, it's growing at a multiple of the rate of our -- of the broader business. Sure. Clearly, we are not going to give you a sort of a guide for next year, and we will give you that early. I guess I'd sort of reposition the question to simply tell you that if you look at our performance of what we said we would do at Analyst Day -- at the Analyst Day and what we've now done, I think we continue to feel really good about the trajectory of the business. Top line growth is strong, stronger than outside of the bounds of what we had said. I think that -- and I think that's really on the strength of underlying business momentum. And so -- we feel really good about the trajectory going into next year from a top line growth standpoint, too. I think growth will be a little wind assisted on PPIs next year, but I think we will give you clear transparency on what that is. But I think it's going to be on top of really strong underlying momentum in the business. And we think that's translating into the AFFO per share sort of growth that we think is needed and attractive. And then you combine that with a healthy dividend yield -- and we think it's a great story. So generally, I would say feel good about the momentum. Top line growth is good. We are going to continue to focus on operating leverage. And we think, therefore, we are going to be able to deliver strong performance on an AFFO per share basis. Keith, anything to add there? Thanks, Matt."

In the interest of wrapping the call up in 1 hour, we would like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to 1. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thank you, Chip. Good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. On the heels of a record Q1, we had an outstanding Q2, with strong and sustained demand across our product portfolio, broad pricing momentum and solid sales execution, with particular strength in Americas and EMEA, resulting in record growth and net bookings and our best-ever quarterly revenue step-up. As our customers progress and accelerate their digital transformation journeys, the relevance of Platform Equinix continues to grow. In our recent global tech trend survey, nearly 70% of the 2,900 IT decision-makers polled indicated their intention to adopt private or hybrid as their cloud architecture of choice, with over 45% of those polled working with 3 or more cloud providers and over 80% indicating their intention to sustain or increase their spend on interconnection. Today, we're seeing this demand for interconnected digital infrastructure across our regions. This quarter's bookings sizably surpassed the prior peak, a great indicator of the strength of the business and our go-forward pipeline. Our business remains resilient and highly diversified, with nearly 1/3 of our 10,000-plus customers closing incremental business in any given quarter. Despite macro conditions, this customer demand, paired with lower-than-expected churn, is driving us above the upper end of our Analyst Day revenue guidance this year and benefiting our AFFO per share guide, with the impact of pricing increases still largely unrealized. Turning to our results. As depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q2 were $1.8 billion, up 10% over the same quarter last year, representing our 78th consecutive quarter of top line revenue growth, a clear reflection of the durability of our business model across economic cycles. Adjusted EBITDA was up 8% year-over-year, with AFFO meaningfully ahead of our expectations due to continued strong operating performance. Interconnection revenues continue to outpace the broader business, growing 13% year-over-year. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Customers continue to embrace Equinix as the best manifestation of the interconnected digital edge. And we continue to scale, extend and innovate across our data center services portfolio. We now have 49 major projects underway across 34 metros in 21 countries, with 13 new projects this quarter, including new data center builds in Dublin, Montreal, New York, Paris, Warsaw and our first build in Chennai, India, the first of several anticipated metro expansions in this fast-growing market. Our unparalleled global scale and reach continues to be a strategic advantage, driving success with service providers looking to extend their reach and rapidly implement as a Service models and with enterprise customers across nearly every sector of the global economy as they modernize their infrastructure and embrace hybrid and multicloud. Wins this quarter included a multinational energy conglomerate, implementing their hybrid cloud strategy across multiple regions, leveraging Network Edge and Equinix Fabric, and F5, a global technology leader in application security and multicloud networking, establishing additional networking nodes in all 3 regions to better support their customers. In May, we closed our acquisition of 4 data centers from Entel, extending Platform Equinix into Chile and bringing our global footprint to 70 metros across 31 countries. Equinix has a decade-long history in Latin America, and this acquisition provides significant expansion capacity, enabling both local businesses and multinationals the opportunity to accelerate their digital transformation and our Lat Am aspirations. We also expect to close on the acquisition of one additional data center from Entel, extending our reach to Lima, Peru in Q3. As the world's digital infrastructure company, we believe it's our responsibility to help bring about a more sustainable future. In 2022, we continue to advance our bold future-first sustainability strategy and are pleased to have been recognized by Sustainalytics as among the best large-cap REITs for ESG and to be ranked seventh on US EPA's National Top 100 list of the largest green power users. We continue to accelerate the transition to cleaner energy grids and recently executed our second Virtual Power Purchase Agreement in Finland. Once operational, these 2 new wind projects, combined with our prior projects, will bring Equinix' total renewable VPPA capacity to 300 megawatts, and we continue to explore additional PPA projects across all 3 regions as we progress towards our goal of 100% clean and renewable energy. Turning to our industry-leading interconnection franchise, we're seeing continued diversification of our ecosystems and robust activities, including a win with Fast Shop, one of Brazil's largest electronics retailers, who chose Equinix to help strengthen interconnection for its digital core, improved cloud connectivity and integrate with the digital retail ecosystem. In Q2, we added an incremental 7,600 interconnections and now have over 435,000 total interconnections on our platform. Equinix Fabric saw a notable increase in provision capacity as channel enablement is driving network resale use cases and customers are increasingly using inter-metro connections on Fabric to connect across their deployments, including a win with Zivver, a cybersecurity company in the Netherlands using Equinix Fabric to connect deployments in Amsterdam and London to provide connectivity for its customers as part of its business expansion. Internet Exchange saw peak traffic up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 25% year-over-year, to greater than 25 terabits per second. Pivoting to our digital services portfolio. We continue to see strong growth and significant opportunity as customers increasingly leverage more Virtual as a Service and Edge solutions. Equinix Metal had a strong bookings quarter as partner-driven solutions like Pure Storage and Dell PowerStore on Equinix Metal are driving performance-centric hybrid cloud opportunities with enterprise customers. Network Edge also had a strong quarter, with a notable increase in large multi-instance deployments from enterprise customers. Both Metal and Network Edge are also driving attractive revenue pull-through to Equinix Fabric. Digital services wins this quarter included Protocol Labs, an open-source R&D lab, increasing its usage of Equinix Metal to support projects that decentralize the web and cloud storage, and a leading waste management services provider, leveraging Fortinet on Network Edge to connect their business units in Asia to their data centers in the U.S. across Equinix Fabric. Our strategy remains simple, to translate our unique and durable advantages into being the platform where buyers and sellers of digital services can come together, enabling them to deploy and interconnect the infrastructure that they need to transform their business. For service providers, demand remains robust as businesses around the world are planning major investments in digital technologies to support ambitious expansion plans following lessons learned from the pandemic. This year, Gartner projects that global spending on public cloud services will reach nearly $500 billion. And we're seeing strong demand across multiple vectors with these key cloud and IT customers. In the quarter, we added 3 new cloud on-ramps in Paris and London and now have nearly 200 on-ramps to the major cloud service providers deployed on our platform, making Equinix the home of hybrid multicloud. We also continue to see tremendous success supporting our hyperscale partners as they invest in subsea cables to facilitate the rapid growth of Internet traffic between continents. And in addition to being an integral part of hyperscale architectures, we continue to drive go-to-market alignment with these market-shaping players, partnering to meet end customer needs for hybrid cloud and making the hyperscalers some of our most productive channel partners. Hyperscaler demand for our xScale offering also remains robust. We had high leasing activity in Q2, pre-leasing our entire Dublin 6 asset, the first phase of our Paris 13 asset and the second phase of our Frankfurt 11 asset, representing more than 38 megawatts of capacity. Looking across the various xScale JVs, we've seen strong demand, with over 170 megawatts now leased across our portfolio. And we currently have 11 xScale builds under development, of which more than 80% is pre-leased. On the enterprise side, Gartner also continues to view digital transformation not as a 1- or 2-year trend, but as a systemic and long-term theme. Our pipeline strongly supports this thesis, and our enterprise activity this quarter was robust with Americas and EMEA regions driving record bookings, with particular strength in banking and health care. Expansions included a leading U.S. health care software vendor, creating an edge hosting environment on the West Coast, and the Hertz Corporation, one of the largest worldwide vehicle rental companies, who deployed on Platform Equinix to support its digital transformation journey, locating infrastructure proximate to cloud providers and tapping into our digital solutions. And once again, our channel program continued to thrive, delivering its fifth consecutive quarter of record bookings, including strong performances for our EMEA and APAC regions, accounting for more than 35% of bookings and nearly 60% of new logos. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and digital-first use cases, with hybrid multicloud as the clear architecture of choice. We saw strength from strategic partners, like AT&T, Cisco, Dell, Google and Microsoft, and including a win with Orange Business Services for -- a security services technology company, to deploy their payment card encryption solution while interconnecting to our financial services and cloud ecosystems. We're also proud to have been named HPE GreenLake's Momentum Partner of the Year for 2022 as we together work to deliver a consistent hybrid and multicloud experience for our joint customers. Now let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results for the quarter.\nKeith Taylor: Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. I hope you're all doing well and enjoying the summer months. Well, as you can see from our results, Q2 was one of our best quarters to date, if not our best. The go-to-market engine continues to convert our healthy pipeline into record bookings with attractive pricing, coupled with low churn dynamics. In fact, it was our eighth straight quarter of increasing net bookings activity, and our forward-looking pipeline remains robust. Our success and the momentum in the business are strong indications of the value customers place on our highly differentiated ecosystems or the breadth of our service offerings, the global scale and reach of our platform and of course, the quality of our operational delivery. With a great first half of 2022, we're again raising our underlying guidance across each of our core financial metrics. Now as you can see from our performance, we continue to manage an instrument in the business to perform across varying economic cycles, even ones like we're experiencing today. While all things macro remain within our focus, we do feel well positioned to address the volatility in the market, and here's why. We have low customer concentration, with no customer representing greater than 3% of our revenues, and our top 50 customers continue to diversify across our platform and as a percentage of revenues. With regards to supply chain, our best-in-class design and construction and strategic sourcing teams are delivering projects consistent with our budget expectations with limited delays and have access greater than $300 million of inventory holds to mitigate future disruptions across a number of critical functions. On inflation, we've largely been effective by protecting our customers and partners from the market fluctuations. But as we continue to assess the likely go-forward trends related to the cost of energy and construction, in addition to the broader inflationary increases affecting wages and other operating costs, we do expect to raise our prices. And with 60% of our revenues coming from outside the U.S., a strong dollar in Q2 has had a notable impact on our as-reported numbers and outlook, yet our sophisticated hedging program has meaningfully dampened the impact to our financial statements. Now let me cover the highlights for the quarter. All comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q2 revenues were $1.817 billion, up 10% over the same quarter last year and above the top end of our guidance range due to better-than-expected step-up in recurring revenues and strong xScale NRR fees. Full MRR per cabinet yield reached the new mark of $2,000 per cabinet. Q2 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $20 million impact when compared to our prior guidance rates due to broad dollar strength. Global Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $860 million or 47% of revenues, up 8% over the same quarter last year, above the top end of our guidance range due to strong operating performance. Q2 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, included a $10 million FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates and $4 million of integration costs. Global Q2 AFFO was $691 million, above our expectations due to strong operating performance and included a $9 million FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q2 MRR churn was 2.1%, again at the lower end of our guidance range. Looking forward, we expect MRR churn to continue to trend favorably and remain at the lower end of our 2% to 2.5% per quarter range. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on slides 5 through 7. APAC was the fastest-growing region on a year-over-year normalized MRR basis at 14%, followed by the Americas and EMEA regions at 11% and 9%, respectively. The Americas region had a record bookings quarter with great performance in our Canadian and Mexican businesses as well as our Denver and Silicon Valley markets and healthy new deal pricing. The Americas go-to-market edge then continues to sell the platform with strong global exports. The Entel Chile assets are performing well against our initial expectations, and we look forward to adding Lima, Peru to our global footprint in August. Our EMEA region also delivered a record bookings performance, with broad-based strength across our cloud, enterprise, content and digital media verticals, led by our London and Paris markets as well as our emerging markets. In the quarter, we saw healthy retail activity with strong pricing across our varying deal sizes and solid adoption of our digital services products. The integration of the MainOne assets into our platform is progressing well, and the business is tracking ahead of our expectations. We're seeing increased focus on sustainability across our European stakeholders, and thus, we're taking an active leadership role through the European Data Centre Association to address this growing and critical matter. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a strong quarter with robust channel activity, led by our businesses in Australia and Singapore. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank our Shanghai operations team for their dedication and effort during their very strict COVID lockdowns over the past quarter to deliver 100% uptime. Their efforts are a shining example of what we call the magic of Equinix as they put \"we\" before \"me\" to ensure our customers' critical infrastructure remained operational. And now, looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. We ended the quarter with cash of approximately $1.9 billion, an increase over the prior quarter, largely due to our April green bond debt offering and strong operating cash flow created by the business, offset by our growth CapEx, the cash dividend and the acquisitions closed in the quarter. In June, Fitch Ratings upgraded us to BBB+, given the strength of our business performance and its cash-generating capabilities as well as our balanced capital funding posture. We're very appreciative of the support received from Fitch. Additionally, during the quarter, we executed some ATM for resale transactions, which will provide approximately $400 million of incremental equity funding when settled later this year. Looking forward, as stated previously, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to funding our growth opportunities with both debt and equity, while creating long-term value for our shareholders. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $490 million, including a recurring CapEx of $35 million. In the quarter, we opened 4 retail projects in London, Mexico City, Milan and Tokyo and 2 xScale projects in Frankfurt and Sydney. We also purchased land for development in Bogota and Mumbai. Revenues from owned assets stepped up to 61% of our total revenues, reflecting our long-term strategy of both developing and purchasing land and IBXs. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our 162 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 7% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 87% utilized and generate a 28% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And finally, please refer to slides 11 through 15 for an updated summary of 2022 guidance and bridges. Do note, our 2022 guidance now includes the anticipated financial results from the Entel Chile acquisition, which closed in May. For the full year 2022, based on the momentum we're seeing in the organic business, we now expect our revenues to increase 10% to 11% on a normalized and constant currency basis over the prior year, trending above our Analyst Day revenue range, a reflection of the healthy digital infrastructure demands that are driving the momentum in our business. Relative to our prior guidance, we're increasing our revenues by $65 million, including $30 million of revenues from the Entel Chile. We expect 2022 underlying adjusted EBITDA to increase by a net $33 million compared to our prior guidance, including $18 million from Entel Chile. We now expect to incur $30 million of integration costs in 2022. We're raising our underlying 2022 AFFO by $33 million to grow between 8% and 10% on a normalized and constant currency basis. And given the strength in our business, 2022 AFFO per share is now expected to grow between 8% and 9% on a normalized and constant currency basis, above the top end of our prior guide, with both the MainOne and Entel acquisition immediately accretive to our business. 2022 CapEx is now expected to range between $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion, including about $185 million of recurring CapEx and about $110 million of on-balance sheet xScale spend. So let me stop here. I'm going to turn the call back to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thanks, Keith. In closing, we had an outstanding first half of 2022, and our business continues to deliver strong and consistent results. Despite a challenging macroeconomic and sociopolitical landscape, demand remains robust as customers continue to invest heavily in digital transformation. And as infrastructure needs evolve, Platform Equinix is increasingly relevant as a point of nexus in IT architectures that are more distributed, more hybrid and more cloud-connected, giving us a distinctive value proposition and meaningful pricing flexibility. The emergence of the cloud continues to disrupt the multitrillion-dollar global IT market, fueling both our hyperscaler relationships and our broader service provider business as successful new entrants extend and expand their infrastructure to drive revenue growth and traditional technology leaders build out distributed delivery infrastructure as they transform to as a Service models. We continue to invest behind this momentum, both in expanding the reach and scale of our data center platform and in accelerating the evolution of our digital services portfolio, which is seeing strong customer interest. In that vein, we're pleased to welcome Jeetu Patel and Fidelma Russo to our Board of Directors. As veteran operating leaders at Cisco and HPE, they bring deep knowledge of both technology and go-to-market aspects of the evolving digital infrastructure landscape. And we're excited about their contributions as we continue to innovate our service offerings for the digital leaders of today and tomorrow. So let me stop there and open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank.\nMatthew Niknam: Congrats on the quarter. Just first, maybe on bookings. So you talked about record quarterly gross and net bookings, Americas and EMEA leading the way. I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit about how trends evolved over the course of the quarter and whether you've seen any moderation, maybe either late 2Q or early 3Q, just in light of the macro backdrop. And then one follow-up. Keith, you mentioned the $400 million in ATM, equity issuance. I'm just wondering, with leverage under 4 turns, can you talk about the strategic rationale for the issuance and how you're thinking about potential uses.\nCharles Meyers: Hey, Matt. It's Charles. I'll take the first one and hand it over to Keith for the second one. So no -- I would say, the trend line on bookings continues to be strong. I think we're seeing real commitment from folks relative to digital transformation. I think we're seeing that strength across regions and across sectors, both in the service provider side of our business and the enterprise side of our business. And that's literally across virtually every sector, as we said in the script. So no moderation, in fact, I would tell you that our pipeline going into Q3 is stronger than it was going into Q2. We've got a lot of forward visibility and really continue to feel very good about the overall demand backdrop for the business.\nKeith Taylor: And Matt, sort of responding to the second question, as it relates to using our ATM, first and foremost is, as you probably heard in the prepared remarks, we've done that on a forward basis so we haven't pulled down the equity yet. And part of it I think is, look, there's a lot of disruption in the marketplace. And one of the things that we know is we're going to continue to build. As you heard, we announced 49 new product -- we have 49 projects underway. We added 13 new projects this quarter. We're closing on the acquisitions, and we're going to continue to fund these dividends. As we think a lot about what we need, not only through the rest of this year but through the end of next year, we want to make sure we bring balance to the market, balance to our capital plans, but also recognize that there was volatility in the marketplace. And so we basically did a forward sale through a number of transactions at $680 a share over the quarter. We're very selective in our timing as you can appreciate. And we just felt that it was a good thing to add to the overall liquidity position of the business. Let me just also, just sort of say one last thing. As you step back and you recognize the momentum in our business and what Charles has just -- what we said in the prepared remarks, but certainly what Charles has also spoken of, the momentum in our business is substantial and the investments that we're making in our assets is going to continue to be substantial. As a result, we want to make sure that we have sufficient liquidity in these periods of great uncertainty. And so raising capital at a time when you can is appropriate, so using the cash on our balance sheet, using our equity. And of course, as you can appreciate, we're going to be looking at some debt structures as well to augment our liquidity position so that we don't have to worry about that next decision, which is what will we do if an opportunity presents itself. So again, it's more about being prudent, having balance, supporting our ratings and at the same time, creating liquidity in the balance sheet for future decisions.\nOperator: Our next question is from Aryeh Klein with BMO Capital Markets.\nAryeh Klein: Same-store revenue growth was the best it's been in a while. I think, last quarter, you mentioned you got a 50 basis point benefit from energy. Is that still the case? And then can you talk about the pricing strategy outside of energy? It sounds like you are increasing prices. So can we see increases above and beyond the 2% to 5% that you've received historically?\nCharles Meyers: Yes. Thanks, Aryeh. The same-store, yes, tremendous quarter on that. And in terms of how much of that wind at the back is energy, it's actually probably a little less than that number in terms of any contributions to that. So really strong quarter overall. So I believe it was, I want to say, 40 bps in that $6.7 million that was associated with energy. So -- but really, I think we would still see north of $6 million even without that. And so a good -- a really good result there and feeling great about that and feel like we can continue to deliver in sort of our previously guided range going forward. In terms of the broader pricing strategy, absolutely. We're looking holistically at the pricing strategy, not only -- and I've talked about this in a number of other forms. There are sort of several levels to the pricing strategy and execution. One is power, and that is about sort of making sure that we can fully recover sort of increases to power in markets where that's occurring and align that up with our hedging strategy. And we've talked in depth about that, but we continue to have high degrees of confidence that we can -- the combination of our hedging and our ability to pass that through will allow us to mitigate those impacts on the business. Second is actually just a broader increase in list pricing on space and power, that is already rolling through, and on interconnection. And interconnection tends to perhaps have a slightly faster impact just because it's -- when things roll through, it's a little more dynamic, if you will, in terms of the way interconnection rolls through the business. So we're raising list prices there. And then as you know, escalators, and I think we will begin to reset escalators at levels that we think are more appropriate for the current environment and dynamics of the market. And so we are already looking at new contracts priced at new list price levels with new escalators, and that -- and as I said in the sort of prepared remarks, I said that the pricing impacts are largely unrealized. Meaning that what you saw in our guide today is not really being fueled by pricing. It is really being fueled by strength in unit volumes, firm pricing, certainly, in terms of how we're pricing, but that's really yet to roll through in terms of -- and I really think we'll start to see those positive pricing impacts in '23.\nAryeh Klein: Got it. If I can just follow up, is there point at which the higher prices force companies to start to reevaluate their objectives around data center expansion and whatnot?\nCharles Meyers: Yes, it's a great question. Obviously, sort of what is the elasticity of demand and how elastic or inelastic is the demand is a question we constantly ask and answer. I would tell you that quite empirically, our evidence would demonstrate that our business is highly inelastic. And in fact, if you look at our interconnection pricing activity in Europe over the last couple of years, we saw a tremendous flow-through on that and very little implication from a churn perspective. And so -- and then the other thing I would -- we've looked hard at kind of where people are in terms of how much of their spend overall is tied up in Equinix as a key sort of point of nexus in their digital infrastructure strategy. And the reality is, is they're getting significant value for that investment. And adjustment in pricing on that has a relatively limited impact in their overall -- in the overall dynamic there. And so we're -- we absolutely want to deliver superior value. We think we can do that at higher price points and still deliver the value that is going to compel people to make Equinix a central part of their long-term architectures.\nOperator: And our next question is from David Barden with Bank of America.\nDavid Barden: I guess I have two kind of higher-level questions. Charles, a lot of the investor base hasn't really lived through the possibility of recession as it relates to data centers. And there's two big questions that we get. One is, will businesses kind of pull back on their data center budgets in a recession? And the second is, given all the IPOs we've seen, some of these companies, smaller companies, start to fail as we saw maybe back in 2001, '02. Is that going to create pressure for the data center business? And I guess, if I could ask a second question, maybe this one is for you, Keith. We obviously saw a well-regarded, short-selling investor come up with a thesis that said that the data centers have 2 problems. One is that they're going to end up competing with their biggest customers, and that's going to cannibalize the need for legacy data center businesses. And second, that it's not obvious the returns on the consolidated data center businesses are actually great. So I know you guys know the answers to those questions. So I would love to kind of just air those out and kind of hear what you guys are thinking now.\nCharles Meyers: Sure. David, I'll start, and I'll probably not be able to resist the chance to answer some of the second one, in addition. So -- and then -- but I'll hand it over to Keith. As for the broader question on recession and potential impact to the demand backdrop and in particular, around exposure to failures, business failures and weaknesses that, that might represent in either startups or those types of companies, as I said, right now, we're seeing no waning of demand relative to people's investment in digital transformation. In fact, I would argue, that I think as they look forward to a potential recessionary environment, many of them are using that either to try to reduce costs by modernizing their IT infrastructure and moving to hybrid and multicloud with greater agility in their IT footprint and architecture. Or they're using that as a fundamental driver of competitive advantage and therefore fuel to their top line, that I think they don't believe they can afford not to invest in. And you're seeing that in virtually every sector. You look at retail, for example, and that's a classic example of a sector that people are saying, oh, boy, recession could clearly impact consumer wallet spend and retail would suffer from that. Well, we are not seeing that show up in terms of their decision-making around their commitment to digital. They simply can't afford not to be prepared for the digital future. And so we see real strength in that sector. Same could be said for various elements of banking and financial services, which people say could feel some of the sting, and yet they continue to invest. And so every quarter, it seems that we give you a different set of sectors that are demonstrating strength in our business. And I think that's just a reflection of just how durable that demand profile is. And so we're keeping a close eye on it, but our previous experience in recessionary environments as well as the current pipeline would lead us to believe that demand continues to be strong. And frankly, we're investing behind that. We're going to be prudent and appropriate and watch it carefully. But we're going to put more quota-bearing heads on the street, given the level of demand that we're seeing in the business. As to startups, honestly, our exposure is relatively limited. Startups often start in cloud. And only as they scale, they move to hybrid infrastructures. And so we don't see a lot of exposure there. And we have not seen sort of business failures or pullback in those as any kind of meaningful contributor to the business. On the short thesis, I would just tell you that I think it represents an underdeveloped understanding of the data center market and the relative position of various players because I think that as I said -- as we said in the script in various ways, our relationship with the hyperscalers, which is a key part of that thesis, is significant, both in terms of our underlying contributions to their architecture in terms of network nodes, on-ramps, et cetera, as well as our alignment with them from a go-to-market perspective. Because we are -- in fact, they're amongst our most productive channel partners as they are selling large multimillion, sometimes multihundred, million-dollar contracts to players that are implementing cloud. Those customers want an answer to what they're going to do with their private infrastructure and how they're going to place that proximate to the multicloud and how it's going to perform. And those are the answers that we're providing. Those are the questions that we're providing the answers to. And so I think that we continue to feel like that this notion of us, sort of that this is a sort of a zero-sum game between us and the hyperscalers, I think, is just not an accurate view of the marketplace. And so -- and then on the broader returns, again, I would say, yes, our business is dramatically different on a return basis. Look at our same-store sales and look at the 28% cash-on-cash returns of those, growing at 7%, which is what we demonstrated this quarter. That is a very, very different story than virtually any other player in the industry can give you. So I couldn't resist stealing that question from Keith. But Keith, please feel free to add your two cents.\nKeith Taylor: David, maybe I could add just a couple of points to what Charles said, which is all very accurate. But the other thing I think is very important for, I think, our investors to appreciate is that we were very wise in our decisioning on how to manage the hyperscale relationships. We have the business that Charles alluded to that sits inside a retail business. And again, as the on-ramps, the aggregation knows the regional network gateways, and things are very critical to running their core infrastructure. But then there's the piece of the business that is substantial in scale and size, that we always chose not to do inside the retail business and instead set up a structure, which is our xScale business. And as we have just talked about, our xScale business is humming as well, given the momentum we're seeing. We have 11 builds underway. We're roughly 80% utilized across all the inventory, that we have not only built but are building or are leased, I should say. And so that puts us in a very good position. Also, to isolate it, in that we only have effectively 10% exposure on an equity basis to those investments. The other thing I think is important to note is these hyperscalers, they're looking for alternatives to -- other than self-build with others because we can do it in locations cheaper and faster than they could do it themselves. And I think it's a testament to the quality of our global design and construction teams. And then last part, I think, is really important to appreciate. A lot of these deals that are done, they're price to yield. And so the price to yield based on a cost model, prices aren't going down, and they're only going up. They're longer-term in nature, your price to yield, and I think it's a really important aspect of the contracting terms. And as a result, as I said at the Analyst Day last year, at maturity, the likelihood, the revenues associated with hyperscale for us represent about 1% to 2% of our top line and will represent a full maturity, again, assuming we spend that $8 billion, plus 3% to 5% of our AFFO. And so we feel that is very resilient, not only to the overall performance of our business, but it's also resilient to the price to yield strategy that you deploy when you contract under these arrangements.\nCharles Meyers: Well, and just to be clear, that last statement in terms of the percentage was relative to xScale. Our broader business with hyperscale is just meaningfully larger than that. It's a $1 billion-plus business outside of xScale run rate and growing nicely because we play a very critical role in that infrastructure in terms of what they do inside of our retail facilities around the world and because of our relationship with them on a go-to-market alignment perspective.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi.\nMichael Rollins: A couple of questions, if I could. First, just on power. If you can give a little bit more detail of what you're seeing in terms of not just power cost in Europe and other markets where there could be issues, but also power availability. And how should investors frame the risk of the supply side of the equation? And then just switching gears over to the change in the annual organic revenue growth guidance, can you give some additional details of as the -- you've seen that evolution in guidance over the last couple of quarters. Where is the relative strength coming from in terms of regions and/or verticals?\nCharles Meyers: Thanks, Mike. Again, I'll start, and Keith can add on here. Yes, obviously, we're super tuned-in to the overall energy situation globally, with a particular focus on Europe, given the uncertainty created by the war in Ukraine. And so -- and you're right, it's not just a cost question, which we're certainly tuned into, but also availability. So let me tackle them both a little bit. Not a lot new to add on the pricing, power cost situation. It is clearly going up in many markets around the world, and I think that's more evident and more acute in Europe. But we are well advanced in our hedging strategy for '23 already. And we are looking at kind of where we will be on that and then how we will pass that through to our customers. And we continue to feel -- have a high degree of confidence in our ability, both contractually and executionally to get that done. The question of availability is a little bit of a different one, and we know that that's on people's minds. And although we don't want to minimize the issues there, and there's clearly some level of risk that certain trade-offs really need to be made in some countries relative to how power will be allocated, we continue to feel really confident in our ability to maintain availability of our services to our customers. And let me tell you kind of why that is. There's really 3 different levels to the issue. And this relates particularly to the question around natural gas, potential implications to the Nord Stream availability and overall supply there. And so we think about it in kind of 3 levels. First one is will the grid be sort of constrained in its ability to deliver the amount of electricity required. And that's really a factor of, particularly as it relates to gas, a factor of 1, is the grid primarily or substantially gas-powered; and two, if it is gas-powered, how exposed is it to the potential shortfalls associated with particularly Russian supply. And what I would tell you is that, generally speaking, natural gas is the underlying source for just a fraction of the electricity generation across our EMEA portfolio. It ranges from almost 0 in the Nordics, to, call it, 30% of roundabout -- around there in the Netherlands, U.K., Turkey and Portugal. Then there's a second-level question though, which is in markets that are dependent, to some degree, on natural gas, how much of that is potentially at risk for -- in terms of Russian supply. And in that case, only the Netherlands and Turkey have more than a 25% dependency on Russian gas. So the composite is really -- the composite risk is really the product of those 2 things. And candidly, we feel like it's very manageable. So that's the first level, is will the electricity grid really be impacted by these things and fall short of its ability to deliver. The second-level question is, if that were to occur, which we think it has some chance of occurring, what will local governments and regulators do and how will they deal with power allocations. And on that level, we think that -- we're confident that we -- we think that those local regulators have a very deep understanding of the criticality of our facilities and that those are -- that our facilities are inherent to the proper functioning of the Internet, of the economy and candidly, to society at large. And we have these sort of critical infrastructure designations in these countries for that reason. And so we feel confident that we're going to continue to have continuity for Equinix data centers, to be a key area of focus for those folks and get the appropriate allocations accordingly. And then the last level of that question is even if all of that were to fall down, we have the resilience within our facilities in the event of any interruption or intermittency in electric supply. And so our facilities are designed with high degrees of redundancy. And our ability to manage through intermittent or even extended periods of interruption to grid availability is very strong. And our track record on delivering exceptional availability even in adverse circumstances like that is well known and I think, frankly, a testament to really the professionalism and preparedness of our team. So that's a lot, but it's -- we've been -- as you might imagine, it is a topic of significant energy and discussion and focus for us. And all in all, we feel, while it is a less than ideal situation in terms of rising costs and potential risk around availability, is one that we feel very well-positioned to manage.\nMichael Rollins: And just while we're on the topic of power, maybe before getting to the revenue question, just one other follow-up. Any update on Singapore, which is a larger discussion during the 4Q earnings call?\nCharles Meyers: Sure. Quick one, Mike. No real update. We -- it's coming in pretty much as we had expected. And again, that exposure in terms of what we're kind of eating, if you will, relative to Singapore, we think, will resolve itself going into 2023. And so no real update. It has some level of impact on our business from a margin perspective this year, but we believe that we can resolve that going into '23.\nMichael Rollins: And then just the regions and verticals of relative strength as you've increased your organic constant currency revenue growth guidance.\nCharles Meyers: Yes. I'll give you a quick two cents on that and then have Keith add to it. Look, it's -- our business is super diverse in terms of -- and all of our regions are performing well. Absolutely great quarter from Europe. Americas performance continues to be strong. And you saw APAC was our fastest grower, right? Now I expect that to be the case. I think that the overall dynamics of Asia are going to continue to allow it to lead there. But amazing performance in Europe, really strong across sectors. And again, I think we're seeing strength in -- this is really the ecosystem nature of our business. We're seeing strength both on the supply side, meaning all these service providers ramping their business to deliver services required for digital transformation and they're doing that at Equinix, and then the enterprise buyer really seeing nexus as that point of -- or seeing Equinix at this point of nexus to really house their hybrid IT infrastructure. And so the short answer is we're seeing it across regions and across sectors. Keith, what do you want to add there?\nKeith Taylor: Yes. And Mike, maybe just adding a couple of points to Charles' comments. When you look at our overall growth, we telegraphed above sort of Analyst Day guide and said that we can grow the business on a normalized and constant currency basis, so normalized, taking out the acquisitions by 10% to 11%. And of that 10% to 11% of growth, roughly 60 basis points is power -- roughly 60 basis points are power price increases that we sort of initiated at the beginning part of the year. So you can see that the core business is performing just phenomenally well. And the U.S., the Americas business specifically, is performing exceedingly well and growing at 10%, 11%. It just gives you a sense of the momentum. And it's across the verticals and it's in the markets that we're fueling basically the capacity. You can also see that we're building in 13 new projects -- there's 49 projects in total, and we call them major projects. There's much more than 49 projects underway, but 49 major projects underway, a number of -- 34 markets, I think, 21 countries. So we're building across the portfolio. And just as a reminder to everybody, the majority of our growth comes from the installed base. 90-plus percent of our bookings is coming from that installed base. And so despite the fact that we don't -- we're seeing the concentration decrease, but the dispersion increase. And that's just -- that's a phenomenal aspect of our business model. And that -- and then the last thing I would just say is our pricing has been strong. Again, another quarter of net positive pricing actions, notwithstanding all the comments that Charles made, which is those are things we'll see in the future, but the relationship of a price increase to a price decrease this quarter was 3.2:1. So for every $1 of decrease, we saw $3.2 of increase. So it gives you a sense of the momentum in our business. And then -- and you can't hide away from the fact that our digital services, they're performing at a very high clip, and that's adding to the overall business. So it's a combination of all these things that are giving you the positive momentum in revenues.\nOperator: And our next question is from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.\nJonathan Atkin: So you talked a lot about influences around the business, around strong demand and power costs, pricing increases. I wonder if you can maybe flesh out a few of the other kind of headwinds or tailwinds as we think about how to model the rest of this year or next year around churn and G&A and maybe any other items that you want to call out and then crystallize maybe kind of the net impact of how you see margins and AFFO per share trend into next year.\nCharles Meyers: Sure. Yes. I mean I think there's obviously a lot of levers in the business. I do think churn continues to be generally a good news story. I think we're seeing -- I think our level of sophistication we have in sort of understanding, modeling and being able to effectively manage churn has really improved dramatically over the years. And I think -- so we have -- we forecast virtually with pretty great precision, our churn, on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And so I think we see that as actually a continued positive story, and that's part of what's been contributing to the sort of record net bookings levels. I think G&A is an area of continued opportunity for us in the business. I think as we look at our hiring, for example, I said we're investing in the business in terms of driving quota-bearing heads into the market given the strong demand backdrop, but we're being very prudent as it relates to adding G&A. We think that's appropriate in this environment, and we're really kind of pulling the reins back, adding only where we feel that's absolutely critical and then also investing in some of the automation and simplification that we're looking for to drive efficiencies in the business. And I think that what we hope that, that will continue to do is give us progression over time towards that long-term target of 50%. And I think we're already seeing some of that. I think on the other side of it, there probably -- there are some headwinds, right? And utilities are part of that. The Singapore situation was fairly unique this year. We think that will resolve next year. But I do think that the broader utility situation as we -- as prices rise, even though I think our hedging strategy and then our pricing increases will allow us to recover that, I do think that some of the increases are going to be a bit more 0 calorie from a margin standpoint, and that is probably going to affect margins on a percentage basis. But I think that our focus is really on driving the top line and then getting the flow-through to AFFO per share. And I think that's what you're seeing in our guide, and that's what we're going to really continue to focus on.\nKeith Taylor: And Jon, let me add a couple of comments, just to Charles' comments as well. Again, you asked about the second half of the year. I think it's important to realize, number one, we -- Q2 had some xScale nonrecurring revenues in it. And so think about next quarter, that -- our nonrecurring revenues are going to go down about $10 million quarter-over-quarter. And then you should see them step back up in Q4. So that's one thing that's happening. Second thing is we're making an investment in the business. We're being very deliberate about committing to the top line, committing to the value on a per share basis and driving as hard as we can on that, but at the same time still making decisions about investing in the business. So Charles alluded to the quota-bearing heads. There's development costs, another $10 million of costs in the second half of the year that weren't in the first half of the year. There's some lease adjustments of $11 million that went -- that's going through the second half of the year, related to some Hong Kong leases. And then we're investing in T&E, another $15 million, because we think that's money well spent, getting our go-to-market engine in front of the customers as well as our teams working together, coming out of a post-COVID environment. So overall, I would say you're going to continue to see momentum in the business. The guide is the guide, but we're deliberately making investments to set ourselves up for a good 2023. And the last thing I think is really important to note. Look, absent the implications of currency, with 60% of our revenues residing outside of the U.S., it has an impact to us. But we know that, that will revert over some period of time. And so when we look at it is we're making -- we're putting -- placing our bets on our -- in our hedging strategies. We're doing all the things that you would expect us to do to try and give you the predictability and the forward-looking visibility. But by the same token, absent what we just -- we reported our revenues, we just hit it this quarter for $100 million because of the weakness in the non-U.S. currencies. When that goes back to more traditional levels, where other markets start to increase their interest rates, similar to what the U.S. is doing here to stave off inflation, you're going to see us recover that type of value. And the implications on revenue is $100 million, EBITDA is $50 million and AFFO is $42 million. You had $0.46 just this quarter alone. We're impacting the year's guidance by $0.46 just because of FX. And most of that is being recovered by better business performance. And so there's a number of things that we'll continue to talk about in Q3, Q4 and certainly as we spend time with you in February on the 2023 guide on these matters.\nJonathan Atkin: That's very helpful. xScale had a strong leasing quarter. Are you pricing in line with the market? Or are you seeing a slightly different trend?\nCharles Meyers: Yes. I mean I think that, as we've said, xScale tends to be one where it's probably a narrower band in pricing. And so -- and it really -- pricing, I think, is dictated substantially more by supply/demand characteristics in any given market. And so I would say that we feel great about our ability to deliver a fantastic offering to those customers. But I would say it's -- it prices more -- market and xScale, I think, is going to price in a narrower band.\nOperator: And our next question is from Frank Louthan with Raymond James.\nFrank Louthan: How many new logos did you sign in the quarter? And how has that been trending in the last few quarters? And in particular, what sort of verticals are you seeing the most strength with?\nKeith Taylor: Well, look, overall, there's roughly 300 new logos in the quarter. I think the exact number is 286. Is that -- anyway, so -- and as I said, we're seeing it -- look, a lot of the growth comes from the installed base, as you understand. But we're seeing it across the portfolio. We talked about content and digital media, cloud, IT services. It's really across the board. And it goes back to Charles' comments. And as companies start to progress with their digital transformation, all sort of paths lead to Equinix. And from our perspective, there's not -- anything and everything that you sort of look at, we have an opportunity to either we have won it or we are -- or we actually have it within our pipeline. And so I would say that it's hard to sort of pinpoint one thing because if we have the capacity, we have the ability to sell in that market. And one of my prepared comments was, in the emerging markets, what we call the growth in emerging markets out of Europe, we're seeing tremendous opportunity there. It was, again, a high-performing quarter for us. And these are sort of the, if you will, the secondary markets to our majors, our majors where we do $100 million or more. So it's really right across the board, both from a geographic perspective, from a vertical perspective and then certainly from a customer perspective. And it's the combination of all those that make us feel very, very good about what we're seeing in our pipeline and the amount of activity we saw this past -- really this past quarter, but we've had growth over the last 8 quarters in a row in our net bookings line. And so it tells you about the momentum, and this quarter wasn't off the charts, one. Last quarter was fantastic. This quarter was better than fantastic.\nCharles Meyers: Yes. I would add 2 more pieces of color around new logos, Frank. One, I would say, if you look at the nonfinancial metrics, it's -- we're in a relatively tight band on that. And -- but I think the one thing that gets lost in that a bit is the number of customers that come to us through channel partners. And so those don't show up in that because we actually booked that through the channel partner. And so that really masks, I think, some of the momentum we like to see, particularly in the broader enterprise market, where we're relying on some of our key partners around the world, whether that be an AT&T or an Orange or a Telstra or whatever, a variety of types of partners of ours that are bringing those customers to the table. And so I think that's something that's kind of lost there, but an area, and given the strength of our channel, I think that's continuing to add significantly. And then the other thing I would say is our success with what we refer to as STAR targets, these sort of the Global 2000-type companies that we're really focused on, good momentum there. In fact, we had a number of Global 2000 additions this quarter. And I think the team is just doing a fantastic job of helping those large, complex global multinationals really think through their strategies on the enterprise side. And then on the service provider side, virtually every enterprise there, a lot of them are becoming service providers, and we're helping them on that journey and because everything is going as a Service. And so I think we're seeing some real strength on that side as well.\nChip Newcom: Thank you. This concludes our Q2 conference call.\nOperator: Goodbye. And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Keith Taylor",
            "content": "Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. I hope you're all doing well and enjoying the summer months. Well, as you can see from our results, Q2 was one of our best quarters to date, if not our best. The go-to-market engine continues to convert our healthy pipeline into record bookings with attractive pricing, coupled with low churn dynamics. In fact, it was our eighth straight quarter of increasing net bookings activity, and our forward-looking pipeline remains robust. Our success and the momentum in the business are strong indications of the value customers place on our highly differentiated ecosystems or the breadth of our service offerings, the global scale and reach of our platform and of course, the quality of our operational delivery. With a great first half of 2022, we're again raising our underlying guidance across each of our core financial metrics. Now as you can see from our performance, we continue to manage an instrument in the business to perform across varying economic cycles, even ones like we're experiencing today. While all things macro remain within our focus, we do feel well positioned to address the volatility in the market, and here's why. We have low customer concentration, with no customer representing greater than 3% of our revenues, and our top 50 customers continue to diversify across our platform and as a percentage of revenues. With regards to supply chain, our best-in-class design and construction and strategic sourcing teams are delivering projects consistent with our budget expectations with limited delays and have access greater than $300 million of inventory holds to mitigate future disruptions across a number of critical functions. On inflation, we've largely been effective by protecting our customers and partners from the market fluctuations. But as we continue to assess the likely go-forward trends related to the cost of energy and construction, in addition to the broader inflationary increases affecting wages and other operating costs, we do expect to raise our prices. And with 60% of our revenues coming from outside the U.S., a strong dollar in Q2 has had a notable impact on our as-reported numbers and outlook, yet our sophisticated hedging program has meaningfully dampened the impact to our financial statements. Now let me cover the highlights for the quarter. All comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q2 revenues were $1.817 billion, up 10% over the same quarter last year and above the top end of our guidance range due to better-than-expected step-up in recurring revenues and strong xScale NRR fees. Full MRR per cabinet yield reached the new mark of $2,000 per cabinet. Q2 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $20 million impact when compared to our prior guidance rates due to broad dollar strength. Global Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $860 million or 47% of revenues, up 8% over the same quarter last year, above the top end of our guidance range due to strong operating performance. Q2 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, included a $10 million FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates and $4 million of integration costs. Global Q2 AFFO was $691 million, above our expectations due to strong operating performance and included a $9 million FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q2 MRR churn was 2.1%, again at the lower end of our guidance range. Looking forward, we expect MRR churn to continue to trend favorably and remain at the lower end of our 2% to 2.5% per quarter range. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on slides 5 through 7. APAC was the fastest-growing region on a year-over-year normalized MRR basis at 14%, followed by the Americas and EMEA regions at 11% and 9%, respectively. The Americas region had a record bookings quarter with great performance in our Canadian and Mexican businesses as well as our Denver and Silicon Valley markets and healthy new deal pricing. The Americas go-to-market edge then continues to sell the platform with strong global exports. The Entel Chile assets are performing well against our initial expectations, and we look forward to adding Lima, Peru to our global footprint in August. Our EMEA region also delivered a record bookings performance, with broad-based strength across our cloud, enterprise, content and digital media verticals, led by our London and Paris markets as well as our emerging markets. In the quarter, we saw healthy retail activity with strong pricing across our varying deal sizes and solid adoption of our digital services products. The integration of the MainOne assets into our platform is progressing well, and the business is tracking ahead of our expectations. We're seeing increased focus on sustainability across our European stakeholders, and thus, we're taking an active leadership role through the European Data Centre Association to address this growing and critical matter. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a strong quarter with robust channel activity, led by our businesses in Australia and Singapore. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank our Shanghai operations team for their dedication and effort during their very strict COVID lockdowns over the past quarter to deliver 100% uptime. Their efforts are a shining example of what we call the magic of Equinix as they put \"we\" before \"me\" to ensure our customers' critical infrastructure remained operational. And now, looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. We ended the quarter with cash of approximately $1.9 billion, an increase over the prior quarter, largely due to our April green bond debt offering and strong operating cash flow created by the business, offset by our growth CapEx, the cash dividend and the acquisitions closed in the quarter. In June, Fitch Ratings upgraded us to BBB+, given the strength of our business performance and its cash-generating capabilities as well as our balanced capital funding posture. We're very appreciative of the support received from Fitch. Additionally, during the quarter, we executed some ATM for resale transactions, which will provide approximately $400 million of incremental equity funding when settled later this year. Looking forward, as stated previously, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to funding our growth opportunities with both debt and equity, while creating long-term value for our shareholders. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $490 million, including a recurring CapEx of $35 million. In the quarter, we opened 4 retail projects in London, Mexico City, Milan and Tokyo and 2 xScale projects in Frankfurt and Sydney. We also purchased land for development in Bogota and Mumbai. Revenues from owned assets stepped up to 61% of our total revenues, reflecting our long-term strategy of both developing and purchasing land and IBXs. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our 162 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 7% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. These stabilized assets are collectively 87% utilized and generate a 28% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And finally, please refer to slides 11 through 15 for an updated summary of 2022 guidance and bridges. Do note, our 2022 guidance now includes the anticipated financial results from the Entel Chile acquisition, which closed in May. For the full year 2022, based on the momentum we're seeing in the organic business, we now expect our revenues to increase 10% to 11% on a normalized and constant currency basis over the prior year, trending above our Analyst Day revenue range, a reflection of the healthy digital infrastructure demands that are driving the momentum in our business. Relative to our prior guidance, we're increasing our revenues by $65 million, including $30 million of revenues from the Entel Chile. We expect 2022 underlying adjusted EBITDA to increase by a net $33 million compared to our prior guidance, including $18 million from Entel Chile. We now expect to incur $30 million of integration costs in 2022. We're raising our underlying 2022 AFFO by $33 million to grow between 8% and 10% on a normalized and constant currency basis. And given the strength in our business, 2022 AFFO per share is now expected to grow between 8% and 9% on a normalized and constant currency basis, above the top end of our prior guide, with both the MainOne and Entel acquisition immediately accretive to our business. 2022 CapEx is now expected to range between $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion, including about $185 million of recurring CapEx and about $110 million of on-balance sheet xScale spend. So let me stop here. I'm going to turn the call back to Charles. And Matt, sort of responding to the second question, as it relates to using our ATM, first and foremost is, as you probably heard in the prepared remarks, we've done that on a forward basis so we haven't pulled down the equity yet. And part of it I think is, look, there's a lot of disruption in the marketplace. And one of the things that we know is we're going to continue to build. As you heard, we announced 49 new product -- we have 49 projects underway. We added 13 new projects this quarter. We're closing on the acquisitions, and we're going to continue to fund these dividends. As we think a lot about what we need, not only through the rest of this year but through the end of next year, we want to make sure we bring balance to the market, balance to our capital plans, but also recognize that there was volatility in the marketplace. And so we basically did a forward sale through a number of transactions at $680 a share over the quarter. We're very selective in our timing as you can appreciate. And we just felt that it was a good thing to add to the overall liquidity position of the business. Let me just also, just sort of say one last thing. As you step back and you recognize the momentum in our business and what Charles has just -- what we said in the prepared remarks, but certainly what Charles has also spoken of, the momentum in our business is substantial and the investments that we're making in our assets is going to continue to be substantial. As a result, we want to make sure that we have sufficient liquidity in these periods of great uncertainty. And so raising capital at a time when you can is appropriate, so using the cash on our balance sheet, using our equity. And of course, as you can appreciate, we're going to be looking at some debt structures as well to augment our liquidity position so that we don't have to worry about that next decision, which is what will we do if an opportunity presents itself. So again, it's more about being prudent, having balance, supporting our ratings and at the same time, creating liquidity in the balance sheet for future decisions. David, maybe I could add just a couple of points to what Charles said, which is all very accurate. But the other thing I think is very important for, I think, our investors to appreciate is that we were very wise in our decisioning on how to manage the hyperscale relationships. We have the business that Charles alluded to that sits inside a retail business. And again, as the on-ramps, the aggregation knows the regional network gateways, and things are very critical to running their core infrastructure. But then there's the piece of the business that is substantial in scale and size, that we always chose not to do inside the retail business and instead set up a structure, which is our xScale business. And as we have just talked about, our xScale business is humming as well, given the momentum we're seeing. We have 11 builds underway. We're roughly 80% utilized across all the inventory, that we have not only built but are building or are leased, I should say. And so that puts us in a very good position. Also, to isolate it, in that we only have effectively 10% exposure on an equity basis to those investments. The other thing I think is important to note is these hyperscalers, they're looking for alternatives to -- other than self-build with others because we can do it in locations cheaper and faster than they could do it themselves. And I think it's a testament to the quality of our global design and construction teams. And then last part, I think, is really important to appreciate. A lot of these deals that are done, they're price to yield. And so the price to yield based on a cost model, prices aren't going down, and they're only going up. They're longer-term in nature, your price to yield, and I think it's a really important aspect of the contracting terms. And as a result, as I said at the Analyst Day last year, at maturity, the likelihood, the revenues associated with hyperscale for us represent about 1% to 2% of our top line and will represent a full maturity, again, assuming we spend that $8 billion, plus 3% to 5% of our AFFO. And so we feel that is very resilient, not only to the overall performance of our business, but it's also resilient to the price to yield strategy that you deploy when you contract under these arrangements. Yes. And Mike, maybe just adding a couple of points to Charles' comments. When you look at our overall growth, we telegraphed above sort of Analyst Day guide and said that we can grow the business on a normalized and constant currency basis, so normalized, taking out the acquisitions by 10% to 11%. And of that 10% to 11% of growth, roughly 60 basis points is power -- roughly 60 basis points are power price increases that we sort of initiated at the beginning part of the year. So you can see that the core business is performing just phenomenally well. And the U.S., the Americas business specifically, is performing exceedingly well and growing at 10%, 11%. It just gives you a sense of the momentum. And it's across the verticals and it's in the markets that we're fueling basically the capacity. You can also see that we're building in 13 new projects -- there's 49 projects in total, and we call them major projects. There's much more than 49 projects underway, but 49 major projects underway, a number of -- 34 markets, I think, 21 countries. So we're building across the portfolio. And just as a reminder to everybody, the majority of our growth comes from the installed base. 90-plus percent of our bookings is coming from that installed base. And so despite the fact that we don't -- we're seeing the concentration decrease, but the dispersion increase. And that's just -- that's a phenomenal aspect of our business model. And that -- and then the last thing I would just say is our pricing has been strong. Again, another quarter of net positive pricing actions, notwithstanding all the comments that Charles made, which is those are things we'll see in the future, but the relationship of a price increase to a price decrease this quarter was 3.2:1. So for every $1 of decrease, we saw $3.2 of increase. So it gives you a sense of the momentum in our business. And then -- and you can't hide away from the fact that our digital services, they're performing at a very high clip, and that's adding to the overall business. So it's a combination of all these things that are giving you the positive momentum in revenues. And Jon, let me add a couple of comments, just to Charles' comments as well. Again, you asked about the second half of the year. I think it's important to realize, number one, we -- Q2 had some xScale nonrecurring revenues in it. And so think about next quarter, that -- our nonrecurring revenues are going to go down about $10 million quarter-over-quarter. And then you should see them step back up in Q4. So that's one thing that's happening. Second thing is we're making an investment in the business. We're being very deliberate about committing to the top line, committing to the value on a per share basis and driving as hard as we can on that, but at the same time still making decisions about investing in the business. So Charles alluded to the quota-bearing heads. There's development costs, another $10 million of costs in the second half of the year that weren't in the first half of the year. There's some lease adjustments of $11 million that went -- that's going through the second half of the year, related to some Hong Kong leases. And then we're investing in T&E, another $15 million, because we think that's money well spent, getting our go-to-market engine in front of the customers as well as our teams working together, coming out of a post-COVID environment. So overall, I would say you're going to continue to see momentum in the business. The guide is the guide, but we're deliberately making investments to set ourselves up for a good 2023. And the last thing I think is really important to note. Look, absent the implications of currency, with 60% of our revenues residing outside of the U.S., it has an impact to us. But we know that, that will revert over some period of time. And so when we look at it is we're making -- we're putting -- placing our bets on our -- in our hedging strategies. We're doing all the things that you would expect us to do to try and give you the predictability and the forward-looking visibility. But by the same token, absent what we just -- we reported our revenues, we just hit it this quarter for $100 million because of the weakness in the non-U.S. currencies. When that goes back to more traditional levels, where other markets start to increase their interest rates, similar to what the U.S. is doing here to stave off inflation, you're going to see us recover that type of value. And the implications on revenue is $100 million, EBITDA is $50 million and AFFO is $42 million. You had $0.46 just this quarter alone. We're impacting the year's guidance by $0.46 just because of FX. And most of that is being recovered by better business performance. And so there's a number of things that we'll continue to talk about in Q3, Q4 and certainly as we spend time with you in February on the 2023 guide on these matters. Well, look, overall, there's roughly 300 new logos in the quarter. I think the exact number is 286. Is that -- anyway, so -- and as I said, we're seeing it -- look, a lot of the growth comes from the installed base, as you understand. But we're seeing it across the portfolio. We talked about content and digital media, cloud, IT services. It's really across the board. And it goes back to Charles' comments. And as companies start to progress with their digital transformation, all sort of paths lead to Equinix. And from our perspective, there's not -- anything and everything that you sort of look at, we have an opportunity to either we have won it or we are -- or we actually have it within our pipeline. And so I would say that it's hard to sort of pinpoint one thing because if we have the capacity, we have the ability to sell in that market. And one of my prepared comments was, in the emerging markets, what we call the growth in emerging markets out of Europe, we're seeing tremendous opportunity there. It was, again, a high-performing quarter for us. And these are sort of the, if you will, the secondary markets to our majors, our majors where we do $100 million or more. So it's really right across the board, both from a geographic perspective, from a vertical perspective and then certainly from a customer perspective. And it's the combination of all those that make us feel very, very good about what we're seeing in our pipeline and the amount of activity we saw this past -- really this past quarter, but we've had growth over the last 8 quarters in a row in our net bookings line. And so it tells you about the momentum, and this quarter wasn't off the charts, one. Last quarter was fantastic. This quarter was better than fantastic."

            "name": "Charles Meyers",
            "content": "Thank you, Chip. Good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. On the heels of a record Q1, we had an outstanding Q2, with strong and sustained demand across our product portfolio, broad pricing momentum and solid sales execution, with particular strength in Americas and EMEA, resulting in record growth and net bookings and our best-ever quarterly revenue step-up. As our customers progress and accelerate their digital transformation journeys, the relevance of Platform Equinix continues to grow. In our recent global tech trend survey, nearly 70% of the 2,900 IT decision-makers polled indicated their intention to adopt private or hybrid as their cloud architecture of choice, with over 45% of those polled working with 3 or more cloud providers and over 80% indicating their intention to sustain or increase their spend on interconnection. Today, we're seeing this demand for interconnected digital infrastructure across our regions. This quarter's bookings sizably surpassed the prior peak, a great indicator of the strength of the business and our go-forward pipeline. Our business remains resilient and highly diversified, with nearly 1/3 of our 10,000-plus customers closing incremental business in any given quarter. Despite macro conditions, this customer demand, paired with lower-than-expected churn, is driving us above the upper end of our Analyst Day revenue guidance this year and benefiting our AFFO per share guide, with the impact of pricing increases still largely unrealized. Turning to our results. As depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q2 were $1.8 billion, up 10% over the same quarter last year, representing our 78th consecutive quarter of top line revenue growth, a clear reflection of the durability of our business model across economic cycles. Adjusted EBITDA was up 8% year-over-year, with AFFO meaningfully ahead of our expectations due to continued strong operating performance. Interconnection revenues continue to outpace the broader business, growing 13% year-over-year. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Customers continue to embrace Equinix as the best manifestation of the interconnected digital edge. And we continue to scale, extend and innovate across our data center services portfolio. We now have 49 major projects underway across 34 metros in 21 countries, with 13 new projects this quarter, including new data center builds in Dublin, Montreal, New York, Paris, Warsaw and our first build in Chennai, India, the first of several anticipated metro expansions in this fast-growing market. Our unparalleled global scale and reach continues to be a strategic advantage, driving success with service providers looking to extend their reach and rapidly implement as a Service models and with enterprise customers across nearly every sector of the global economy as they modernize their infrastructure and embrace hybrid and multicloud. Wins this quarter included a multinational energy conglomerate, implementing their hybrid cloud strategy across multiple regions, leveraging Network Edge and Equinix Fabric, and F5, a global technology leader in application security and multicloud networking, establishing additional networking nodes in all 3 regions to better support their customers. In May, we closed our acquisition of 4 data centers from Entel, extending Platform Equinix into Chile and bringing our global footprint to 70 metros across 31 countries. Equinix has a decade-long history in Latin America, and this acquisition provides significant expansion capacity, enabling both local businesses and multinationals the opportunity to accelerate their digital transformation and our Lat Am aspirations. We also expect to close on the acquisition of one additional data center from Entel, extending our reach to Lima, Peru in Q3. As the world's digital infrastructure company, we believe it's our responsibility to help bring about a more sustainable future. In 2022, we continue to advance our bold future-first sustainability strategy and are pleased to have been recognized by Sustainalytics as among the best large-cap REITs for ESG and to be ranked seventh on US EPA's National Top 100 list of the largest green power users. We continue to accelerate the transition to cleaner energy grids and recently executed our second Virtual Power Purchase Agreement in Finland. Once operational, these 2 new wind projects, combined with our prior projects, will bring Equinix' total renewable VPPA capacity to 300 megawatts, and we continue to explore additional PPA projects across all 3 regions as we progress towards our goal of 100% clean and renewable energy. Turning to our industry-leading interconnection franchise, we're seeing continued diversification of our ecosystems and robust activities, including a win with Fast Shop, one of Brazil's largest electronics retailers, who chose Equinix to help strengthen interconnection for its digital core, improved cloud connectivity and integrate with the digital retail ecosystem. In Q2, we added an incremental 7,600 interconnections and now have over 435,000 total interconnections on our platform. Equinix Fabric saw a notable increase in provision capacity as channel enablement is driving network resale use cases and customers are increasingly using inter-metro connections on Fabric to connect across their deployments, including a win with Zivver, a cybersecurity company in the Netherlands using Equinix Fabric to connect deployments in Amsterdam and London to provide connectivity for its customers as part of its business expansion. Internet Exchange saw peak traffic up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 25% year-over-year, to greater than 25 terabits per second. Pivoting to our digital services portfolio. We continue to see strong growth and significant opportunity as customers increasingly leverage more Virtual as a Service and Edge solutions. Equinix Metal had a strong bookings quarter as partner-driven solutions like Pure Storage and Dell PowerStore on Equinix Metal are driving performance-centric hybrid cloud opportunities with enterprise customers. Network Edge also had a strong quarter, with a notable increase in large multi-instance deployments from enterprise customers. Both Metal and Network Edge are also driving attractive revenue pull-through to Equinix Fabric. Digital services wins this quarter included Protocol Labs, an open-source R&D lab, increasing its usage of Equinix Metal to support projects that decentralize the web and cloud storage, and a leading waste management services provider, leveraging Fortinet on Network Edge to connect their business units in Asia to their data centers in the U.S. across Equinix Fabric. Our strategy remains simple, to translate our unique and durable advantages into being the platform where buyers and sellers of digital services can come together, enabling them to deploy and interconnect the infrastructure that they need to transform their business. For service providers, demand remains robust as businesses around the world are planning major investments in digital technologies to support ambitious expansion plans following lessons learned from the pandemic. This year, Gartner projects that global spending on public cloud services will reach nearly $500 billion. And we're seeing strong demand across multiple vectors with these key cloud and IT customers. In the quarter, we added 3 new cloud on-ramps in Paris and London and now have nearly 200 on-ramps to the major cloud service providers deployed on our platform, making Equinix the home of hybrid multicloud. We also continue to see tremendous success supporting our hyperscale partners as they invest in subsea cables to facilitate the rapid growth of Internet traffic between continents. And in addition to being an integral part of hyperscale architectures, we continue to drive go-to-market alignment with these market-shaping players, partnering to meet end customer needs for hybrid cloud and making the hyperscalers some of our most productive channel partners. Hyperscaler demand for our xScale offering also remains robust. We had high leasing activity in Q2, pre-leasing our entire Dublin 6 asset, the first phase of our Paris 13 asset and the second phase of our Frankfurt 11 asset, representing more than 38 megawatts of capacity. Looking across the various xScale JVs, we've seen strong demand, with over 170 megawatts now leased across our portfolio. And we currently have 11 xScale builds under development, of which more than 80% is pre-leased. On the enterprise side, Gartner also continues to view digital transformation not as a 1- or 2-year trend, but as a systemic and long-term theme. Our pipeline strongly supports this thesis, and our enterprise activity this quarter was robust with Americas and EMEA regions driving record bookings, with particular strength in banking and health care. Expansions included a leading U.S. health care software vendor, creating an edge hosting environment on the West Coast, and the Hertz Corporation, one of the largest worldwide vehicle rental companies, who deployed on Platform Equinix to support its digital transformation journey, locating infrastructure proximate to cloud providers and tapping into our digital solutions. And once again, our channel program continued to thrive, delivering its fifth consecutive quarter of record bookings, including strong performances for our EMEA and APAC regions, accounting for more than 35% of bookings and nearly 60% of new logos. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and digital-first use cases, with hybrid multicloud as the clear architecture of choice. We saw strength from strategic partners, like AT&T, Cisco, Dell, Google and Microsoft, and including a win with Orange Business Services for -- a security services technology company, to deploy their payment card encryption solution while interconnecting to our financial services and cloud ecosystems. We're also proud to have been named HPE GreenLake's Momentum Partner of the Year for 2022 as we together work to deliver a consistent hybrid and multicloud experience for our joint customers. Now let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results for the quarter. Thanks, Keith. In closing, we had an outstanding first half of 2022, and our business continues to deliver strong and consistent results. Despite a challenging macroeconomic and sociopolitical landscape, demand remains robust as customers continue to invest heavily in digital transformation. And as infrastructure needs evolve, Platform Equinix is increasingly relevant as a point of nexus in IT architectures that are more distributed, more hybrid and more cloud-connected, giving us a distinctive value proposition and meaningful pricing flexibility. The emergence of the cloud continues to disrupt the multitrillion-dollar global IT market, fueling both our hyperscaler relationships and our broader service provider business as successful new entrants extend and expand their infrastructure to drive revenue growth and traditional technology leaders build out distributed delivery infrastructure as they transform to as a Service models. We continue to invest behind this momentum, both in expanding the reach and scale of our data center platform and in accelerating the evolution of our digital services portfolio, which is seeing strong customer interest. In that vein, we're pleased to welcome Jeetu Patel and Fidelma Russo to our Board of Directors. As veteran operating leaders at Cisco and HPE, they bring deep knowledge of both technology and go-to-market aspects of the evolving digital infrastructure landscape. And we're excited about their contributions as we continue to innovate our service offerings for the digital leaders of today and tomorrow. So let me stop there and open it up for questions. Hey, Matt. It's Charles. I'll take the first one and hand it over to Keith for the second one. So no -- I would say, the trend line on bookings continues to be strong. I think we're seeing real commitment from folks relative to digital transformation. I think we're seeing that strength across regions and across sectors, both in the service provider side of our business and the enterprise side of our business. And that's literally across virtually every sector, as we said in the script. So no moderation, in fact, I would tell you that our pipeline going into Q3 is stronger than it was going into Q2. We've got a lot of forward visibility and really continue to feel very good about the overall demand backdrop for the business. Yes. Thanks, Aryeh. The same-store, yes, tremendous quarter on that. And in terms of how much of that wind at the back is energy, it's actually probably a little less than that number in terms of any contributions to that. So really strong quarter overall. So I believe it was, I want to say, 40 bps in that $6.7 million that was associated with energy. So -- but really, I think we would still see north of $6 million even without that. And so a good -- a really good result there and feeling great about that and feel like we can continue to deliver in sort of our previously guided range going forward. In terms of the broader pricing strategy, absolutely. We're looking holistically at the pricing strategy, not only -- and I've talked about this in a number of other forms. There are sort of several levels to the pricing strategy and execution. One is power, and that is about sort of making sure that we can fully recover sort of increases to power in markets where that's occurring and align that up with our hedging strategy. And we've talked in depth about that, but we continue to have high degrees of confidence that we can -- the combination of our hedging and our ability to pass that through will allow us to mitigate those impacts on the business. Second is actually just a broader increase in list pricing on space and power, that is already rolling through, and on interconnection. And interconnection tends to perhaps have a slightly faster impact just because it's -- when things roll through, it's a little more dynamic, if you will, in terms of the way interconnection rolls through the business. So we're raising list prices there. And then as you know, escalators, and I think we will begin to reset escalators at levels that we think are more appropriate for the current environment and dynamics of the market. And so we are already looking at new contracts priced at new list price levels with new escalators, and that -- and as I said in the sort of prepared remarks, I said that the pricing impacts are largely unrealized. Meaning that what you saw in our guide today is not really being fueled by pricing. It is really being fueled by strength in unit volumes, firm pricing, certainly, in terms of how we're pricing, but that's really yet to roll through in terms of -- and I really think we'll start to see those positive pricing impacts in '23. Yes, it's a great question. Obviously, sort of what is the elasticity of demand and how elastic or inelastic is the demand is a question we constantly ask and answer. I would tell you that quite empirically, our evidence would demonstrate that our business is highly inelastic. And in fact, if you look at our interconnection pricing activity in Europe over the last couple of years, we saw a tremendous flow-through on that and very little implication from a churn perspective. And so -- and then the other thing I would -- we've looked hard at kind of where people are in terms of how much of their spend overall is tied up in Equinix as a key sort of point of nexus in their digital infrastructure strategy. And the reality is, is they're getting significant value for that investment. And adjustment in pricing on that has a relatively limited impact in their overall -- in the overall dynamic there. And so we're -- we absolutely want to deliver superior value. We think we can do that at higher price points and still deliver the value that is going to compel people to make Equinix a central part of their long-term architectures. Sure. David, I'll start, and I'll probably not be able to resist the chance to answer some of the second one, in addition. So -- and then -- but I'll hand it over to Keith. As for the broader question on recession and potential impact to the demand backdrop and in particular, around exposure to failures, business failures and weaknesses that, that might represent in either startups or those types of companies, as I said, right now, we're seeing no waning of demand relative to people's investment in digital transformation. In fact, I would argue, that I think as they look forward to a potential recessionary environment, many of them are using that either to try to reduce costs by modernizing their IT infrastructure and moving to hybrid and multicloud with greater agility in their IT footprint and architecture. Or they're using that as a fundamental driver of competitive advantage and therefore fuel to their top line, that I think they don't believe they can afford not to invest in. And you're seeing that in virtually every sector. You look at retail, for example, and that's a classic example of a sector that people are saying, oh, boy, recession could clearly impact consumer wallet spend and retail would suffer from that. Well, we are not seeing that show up in terms of their decision-making around their commitment to digital. They simply can't afford not to be prepared for the digital future. And so we see real strength in that sector. Same could be said for various elements of banking and financial services, which people say could feel some of the sting, and yet they continue to invest. And so every quarter, it seems that we give you a different set of sectors that are demonstrating strength in our business. And I think that's just a reflection of just how durable that demand profile is. And so we're keeping a close eye on it, but our previous experience in recessionary environments as well as the current pipeline would lead us to believe that demand continues to be strong. And frankly, we're investing behind that. We're going to be prudent and appropriate and watch it carefully. But we're going to put more quota-bearing heads on the street, given the level of demand that we're seeing in the business. As to startups, honestly, our exposure is relatively limited. Startups often start in cloud. And only as they scale, they move to hybrid infrastructures. And so we don't see a lot of exposure there. And we have not seen sort of business failures or pullback in those as any kind of meaningful contributor to the business. On the short thesis, I would just tell you that I think it represents an underdeveloped understanding of the data center market and the relative position of various players because I think that as I said -- as we said in the script in various ways, our relationship with the hyperscalers, which is a key part of that thesis, is significant, both in terms of our underlying contributions to their architecture in terms of network nodes, on-ramps, et cetera, as well as our alignment with them from a go-to-market perspective. Because we are -- in fact, they're amongst our most productive channel partners as they are selling large multimillion, sometimes multihundred, million-dollar contracts to players that are implementing cloud. Those customers want an answer to what they're going to do with their private infrastructure and how they're going to place that proximate to the multicloud and how it's going to perform. And those are the answers that we're providing. Those are the questions that we're providing the answers to. And so I think that we continue to feel like that this notion of us, sort of that this is a sort of a zero-sum game between us and the hyperscalers, I think, is just not an accurate view of the marketplace. And so -- and then on the broader returns, again, I would say, yes, our business is dramatically different on a return basis. Look at our same-store sales and look at the 28% cash-on-cash returns of those, growing at 7%, which is what we demonstrated this quarter. That is a very, very different story than virtually any other player in the industry can give you. So I couldn't resist stealing that question from Keith. But Keith, please feel free to add your two cents. Well, and just to be clear, that last statement in terms of the percentage was relative to xScale. Our broader business with hyperscale is just meaningfully larger than that. It's a $1 billion-plus business outside of xScale run rate and growing nicely because we play a very critical role in that infrastructure in terms of what they do inside of our retail facilities around the world and because of our relationship with them on a go-to-market alignment perspective. Thanks, Mike. Again, I'll start, and Keith can add on here. Yes, obviously, we're super tuned-in to the overall energy situation globally, with a particular focus on Europe, given the uncertainty created by the war in Ukraine. And so -- and you're right, it's not just a cost question, which we're certainly tuned into, but also availability. So let me tackle them both a little bit. Not a lot new to add on the pricing, power cost situation. It is clearly going up in many markets around the world, and I think that's more evident and more acute in Europe. But we are well advanced in our hedging strategy for '23 already. And we are looking at kind of where we will be on that and then how we will pass that through to our customers. And we continue to feel -- have a high degree of confidence in our ability, both contractually and executionally to get that done. The question of availability is a little bit of a different one, and we know that that's on people's minds. And although we don't want to minimize the issues there, and there's clearly some level of risk that certain trade-offs really need to be made in some countries relative to how power will be allocated, we continue to feel really confident in our ability to maintain availability of our services to our customers. And let me tell you kind of why that is. There's really 3 different levels to the issue. And this relates particularly to the question around natural gas, potential implications to the Nord Stream availability and overall supply there. And so we think about it in kind of 3 levels. First one is will the grid be sort of constrained in its ability to deliver the amount of electricity required. And that's really a factor of, particularly as it relates to gas, a factor of 1, is the grid primarily or substantially gas-powered; and two, if it is gas-powered, how exposed is it to the potential shortfalls associated with particularly Russian supply. And what I would tell you is that, generally speaking, natural gas is the underlying source for just a fraction of the electricity generation across our EMEA portfolio. It ranges from almost 0 in the Nordics, to, call it, 30% of roundabout -- around there in the Netherlands, U.K., Turkey and Portugal. Then there's a second-level question though, which is in markets that are dependent, to some degree, on natural gas, how much of that is potentially at risk for -- in terms of Russian supply. And in that case, only the Netherlands and Turkey have more than a 25% dependency on Russian gas. So the composite is really -- the composite risk is really the product of those 2 things. And candidly, we feel like it's very manageable. So that's the first level, is will the electricity grid really be impacted by these things and fall short of its ability to deliver. The second-level question is, if that were to occur, which we think it has some chance of occurring, what will local governments and regulators do and how will they deal with power allocations. And on that level, we think that -- we're confident that we -- we think that those local regulators have a very deep understanding of the criticality of our facilities and that those are -- that our facilities are inherent to the proper functioning of the Internet, of the economy and candidly, to society at large. And we have these sort of critical infrastructure designations in these countries for that reason. And so we feel confident that we're going to continue to have continuity for Equinix data centers, to be a key area of focus for those folks and get the appropriate allocations accordingly. And then the last level of that question is even if all of that were to fall down, we have the resilience within our facilities in the event of any interruption or intermittency in electric supply. And so our facilities are designed with high degrees of redundancy. And our ability to manage through intermittent or even extended periods of interruption to grid availability is very strong. And our track record on delivering exceptional availability even in adverse circumstances like that is well known and I think, frankly, a testament to really the professionalism and preparedness of our team. So that's a lot, but it's -- we've been -- as you might imagine, it is a topic of significant energy and discussion and focus for us. And all in all, we feel, while it is a less than ideal situation in terms of rising costs and potential risk around availability, is one that we feel very well-positioned to manage. Sure. Quick one, Mike. No real update. We -- it's coming in pretty much as we had expected. And again, that exposure in terms of what we're kind of eating, if you will, relative to Singapore, we think, will resolve itself going into 2023. And so no real update. It has some level of impact on our business from a margin perspective this year, but we believe that we can resolve that going into '23. Yes. I'll give you a quick two cents on that and then have Keith add to it. Look, it's -- our business is super diverse in terms of -- and all of our regions are performing well. Absolutely great quarter from Europe. Americas performance continues to be strong. And you saw APAC was our fastest grower, right? Now I expect that to be the case. I think that the overall dynamics of Asia are going to continue to allow it to lead there. But amazing performance in Europe, really strong across sectors. And again, I think we're seeing strength in -- this is really the ecosystem nature of our business. We're seeing strength both on the supply side, meaning all these service providers ramping their business to deliver services required for digital transformation and they're doing that at Equinix, and then the enterprise buyer really seeing nexus as that point of -- or seeing Equinix at this point of nexus to really house their hybrid IT infrastructure. And so the short answer is we're seeing it across regions and across sectors. Keith, what do you want to add there? Sure. Yes. I mean I think there's obviously a lot of levers in the business. I do think churn continues to be generally a good news story. I think we're seeing -- I think our level of sophistication we have in sort of understanding, modeling and being able to effectively manage churn has really improved dramatically over the years. And I think -- so we have -- we forecast virtually with pretty great precision, our churn, on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And so I think we see that as actually a continued positive story, and that's part of what's been contributing to the sort of record net bookings levels. I think G&A is an area of continued opportunity for us in the business. I think as we look at our hiring, for example, I said we're investing in the business in terms of driving quota-bearing heads into the market given the strong demand backdrop, but we're being very prudent as it relates to adding G&A. We think that's appropriate in this environment, and we're really kind of pulling the reins back, adding only where we feel that's absolutely critical and then also investing in some of the automation and simplification that we're looking for to drive efficiencies in the business. And I think that what we hope that, that will continue to do is give us progression over time towards that long-term target of 50%. And I think we're already seeing some of that. I think on the other side of it, there probably -- there are some headwinds, right? And utilities are part of that. The Singapore situation was fairly unique this year. We think that will resolve next year. But I do think that the broader utility situation as we -- as prices rise, even though I think our hedging strategy and then our pricing increases will allow us to recover that, I do think that some of the increases are going to be a bit more 0 calorie from a margin standpoint, and that is probably going to affect margins on a percentage basis. But I think that our focus is really on driving the top line and then getting the flow-through to AFFO per share. And I think that's what you're seeing in our guide, and that's what we're going to really continue to focus on. Yes. I mean I think that, as we've said, xScale tends to be one where it's probably a narrower band in pricing. And so -- and it really -- pricing, I think, is dictated substantially more by supply/demand characteristics in any given market. And so I would say that we feel great about our ability to deliver a fantastic offering to those customers. But I would say it's -- it prices more -- market and xScale, I think, is going to price in a narrower band. Yes. I would add 2 more pieces of color around new logos, Frank. One, I would say, if you look at the nonfinancial metrics, it's -- we're in a relatively tight band on that. And -- but I think the one thing that gets lost in that a bit is the number of customers that come to us through channel partners. And so those don't show up in that because we actually booked that through the channel partner. And so that really masks, I think, some of the momentum we like to see, particularly in the broader enterprise market, where we're relying on some of our key partners around the world, whether that be an AT&T or an Orange or a Telstra or whatever, a variety of types of partners of ours that are bringing those customers to the table. And so I think that's something that's kind of lost there, but an area, and given the strength of our channel, I think that's continuing to add significantly. And then the other thing I would say is our success with what we refer to as STAR targets, these sort of the Global 2000-type companies that we're really focused on, good momentum there. In fact, we had a number of Global 2000 additions this quarter. And I think the team is just doing a fantastic job of helping those large, complex global multinationals really think through their strategies on the enterprise side. And then on the service provider side, virtually every enterprise there, a lot of them are becoming service providers, and we're helping them on that journey and because everything is going as a Service. And so I think we're seeing some real strength on that side as well."

With us today are Charles Meyers, Equinix' CEO and President; and Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we will be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up under an hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thanks, Chip. Welcome to the call. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome also to all of you to our first quarter earnings call. We had a great start to 2022, delivering the best net booking performance in our history, fueled by strong demand across all three regions, robust net pricing actions and near-record low churn, resulting in our 77th consecutive quarter of top line growth, the longest such streak of any S&P 500 company. We executed more than 4,200 deals in the quarter across more than 3,100 customers, demonstrating both the scale and the consistency of our go-to-market machine. While there are a number of macroeconomic factors that we continue to proactively manage, including rising interest rates, inflation and geopolitical conflict, the business continues to perform exceptionally well. And underlying demand for digital infrastructure continues to rise as enterprises across the globe and in diverse sectors prioritize digital transformation and service providers continue to innovate, distribute and scale their infrastructure globally in response to that demand. Unfortunately, the war in Ukraine is still unfolding, and we continue to be part of the vigorous global response to that conflict. As stewards of key elements of the world's digital infrastructure, we're committed to doing our part in maintaining that infrastructure to support free and open communications and aid in humanitarian relief. While we do not have operations in Russia or Ukraine, our employees have shown incredible generosity supporting Ukrainian refugees, particularly our team in Poland. Looking more broadly at our responsibilities as a market leader, we continue to advance a bold future-first sustainability agenda that reflects our company's values across our environmental, social and governance initiatives. We recently published our 2021 corporate sustainability highlights, and I'm pleased to report continued progress, including a 3.6% increase in representation of women at leadership levels and a 20% increase in the number of employees, leveraging our well-being and our mental health benefits. We also continue to develop pathways and partnerships to enhance our diversity and create opportunities for historically underrepresented groups, both inside and outside of Equinix. As we work to address the urgency of climate change, I'm also proud, that Equinix is well on our way to meeting our science-based target commitments. In 2021, we achieved over 90% renewable energy coverage for our portfolio for the fourth consecutive year, while also improving the energy efficiency of our facilities by over 5% as measured by average annual power usage effectiveness, or PUE. A focus on sustainability continues to be top of mind for customers and partners, as they look to buy from and work with companies that have established ESG goals and commitments. As the world's digital infrastructure leader, we have a responsibility to harness the power of technology to create a more accessible, equitable and sustainable future, and we will continue to focus on the important issues that impact our stakeholders and our business. Now, turning to the results as depicted on slide three. Revenues for Q1 were $1.7 billion, up 10% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 5% year-over-year, and AFFO was better than our expectations, again due to strong operating performance. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our data center services portfolio continues to extend our differentiated scale and reach, with 43 projects underway across 29 metros in 20 countries, including new projects in Atlanta, Mumbai, Sydney, Tokyo and Washington, D.C., as customers embrace our interconnected edge as a point of nexus for their hybrid and multi-cloud architectures and leverage our scaled digital ecosystems to enable and drive their digital agenda. According to IDC, by 2024, 65% of the Global 2000 will embed some sort of edge-first data stewardship, security and network practices into their organization's digital business processes, and we're already seeing the impact with an amazing 89% of recurring revenues, now coming from customers deployed in more than one metro. In April, we closed our acquisition of MainOne, extending platform Equinix into Nigeria, Ghana and Ivory Coast, bringing our global coverage to 69 metros across 30 countries. Nigeria, in particular, is emerging as an innovative and dynamic player in the global digital economy, representing a significant opportunity for the expansion of digital services and a key first step in our long-term strategy to extend our carrier-neutral digital infrastructure platform across Africa. In the quarter, we also announced our upcoming expansion into Chile, through the planned acquisition of multiple data centers from Entel, a leading Chilean telecommunications provider. Chile is the fourth largest economy in South America with the highest GDP per capita in the region. And Santiago is emerging as a technology hub, serving both regional cloud and content demand, as well as local enterprises. This transaction is expected to close in Q2 and will further solidify Equinix as the leading provider of digital infrastructure in Latin America. Turning to interconnection. Our industry-leading portfolio continues to outpace the broader business, growing 12% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, driven by a healthy uptick in connections across our top ecosystem. We added an incremental 8,900 total interconnections in the quarter and now have over 428,000 total interconnections on the platform. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 7% quarter-over-quarter and 25% year-over-year to greater than 24 terabits per second. And we continue to see expanding customer demand and accelerated growth across our digital services portfolio.  Equinix Fabric saw its highest ever virtual connection ads as customers employ an increasingly diverse set of end destinations and utilize fabric for a variety of use cases across cloud networking and backbone connectivity. Equinix Metal and Network Edge also had strong quarters as enterprises leverage these services for a variety of virtual deployments, increasing agility and helping them to mitigate supply chain challenges. Metal has the most net customer adds to its service since its launch, with several key enterprise wins and a healthy backlog as our go-to-market partnerships with Dell, Pure Storage and Mirantis all gained momentum.  Shifting to our xScale initiative. In March, we closed our Australian JV with PGIM, which is expected to provide more than 55 megawatts of capacity in the Sydney market when closed and fully built out. And in April, we closed our South Korea JV with GIC, which is expected to provide more than 45 megawatts to the rapidly growing Seoul market. We currently have 9 xScale builds under development with over 80 megawatts of incremental capacity, of which nearly two-thirds are already pre-leased. So now I'll cover some highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical had a great quarter with good momentum across all three regions and record channel activity with our key carrier partners. New wins and expansions included one of the largest ISPs in India, establishing network hubs in our Mumbai 1 and 2 IBS, a high-speed satellite broadband service for military and commercial markets, supporting its expansion into Australia; and Global Net, a specialty network expanding its footprint and upgrading connectivity to support its growing user.  And enterprise continues to be our fastest-growing vertical with a strong bookings quarter led by EMEA in the manufacturing and public sector subsegments. New wins and expansions included Technicolor, the creative services and technology company within the media and entertainment industry, establishing regional technology hubs utilizing the full suite of Equinix' digital infrastructure services.  The Global [indiscernible] choosing Equinix as their strategic partner, thanks to our robust digital offerings, connectivity to key financial institutions and our sustainability strategy, and [indiscernible], a global leader in the celebrations industry using network edges to enable cloud connectivity and allow private interconnection between sites as they continue with their digital transformation.  We were also proud to work with a global money center bank who leveraged our advanced ecosystems to enable a critical connection to the National Bank of Ukraine, where the UNICEF could distribute funds to those in need, to those that need it most as part of their humanitarian efforts.  Our cloud and IT services vertical had solid bookings in the quarter, led by the infrastructure subset, while adding new cloud on-ramps in Dubai, Rio de Janeiro and Stockholm. New wins and expansions included Digital Edge, a rapidly scaling global cloud hosting provider, who is expanding its infrastructure footprint across multiple regions as they add customers and products. And a leading SaaS company, leveraging Equinix for its distributed data and cloud strategy and expanding service portfolio.  The broadcast and streaming subsegments anchored a solid quarter of content and digital media, including expansions of the Fortune 75 Media Conglomerates, expanding across Platform Equinix to support streaming services and content production. A multinational consumer credit reporting company, enabling direct connectivity via Equinix to their financial services customers and Fastly, a global CDM expanding capacity and deploying network nodes in support of their edge compute strategy.  And finally, our channel program again delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of record bookings, accounting for roughly 40% of bookings and 60% of new logos. Reseller and alliance partners accounted for over 75% of channel bookings, as our partners continue to demonstrate tremendous leadership in helping customers quickly adopt new digital business models. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and digital first use cases with hybrid multi-cloud featuring prominently as the architecture of choice. We saw continued strength with strategic partners like AWS, Microsoft, Dell and Telstra, including a significant win in France with AT&T, helping a security services company consolidate data centers and interconnect to their choice of cloud providers. We'd also like to recognize AT&T business as our partner of the year for 2021. Proud to have worked together to drive digital first outcomes on complex and transformational projects, including the Equinix and AT&T connected cloud initiatives, benefiting hundreds of customers across multiple industries. Now let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results for the quarter.\nKeith Taylor : Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. I do hope you're doing well. At Equinix, the team delivered another great quarter. We did better than anticipated. We experienced robust growth in the Americas and solid channel bookings, further expanding the universe of opportunity for our highly differentiated business and enjoyed meaningful inter and intra-region activity, a reflection of we're selling well across our ever-expanding footprint. Interconnection activity remains high both in the physical and the virtual level. Interconnection revenues represent 19% of our recurring revenues and are growing faster than the overall business. Our platform strategy continues to deliver outside its value, further separating us from others in our space. We had strong growth from our digital services products and continued momentum in the most recent acquisitions in Canada, India and Mexico. And our pipeline remains solid despite our record bookings. With a great start to 2022, we're raising our guidance across each of our core financial metrics. As we've said previously, we believe the diversity and scale of our business across sectors, markets and customers puts us in a highly favorable position to capitalize on all trends digital as well as manage the macro factors and volatility. We have no meaningful near-term exposure to rising interest rates. Our balance sheet strength continues to provide us with a strategic advantage, while allowing us to access the capital markets at times that are attractive to us. With regards to supply chain and inflation, we continue to deliver projects against our return expectations with limited delays given our ability to access and secure critical infrastructure components. And while the energy markets remain volatile, our hedging policies are helping us navigate this unusual period. These factors, when combined with the momentum we're seeing in our marketplace, enable us to remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver top line growth, strong and durable AFFO per share growth to our shareholders as well. Now let me cover the highlights for the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q1 revenues were $1.734 billion, up 10% over the same quarter last year and at the midpoint of our guidance due to better than expected MRR revenues, offset in part by the delayed timing of certain nonrecurring ex-scale fees. As we look forward, we expect a strong Q2 step-up in both recurring and non-recurring revenues. As we've noted before, non-recurring revenues attributed to customer installation work and xScale fee income are inherently lumpy and can move between quarters. Q1 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $2 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $800 million or 46% of revenues, up 5% over the same quarter last year at the high end of our guidance range due to strong operating performance and timing of spend, although it was impacted by the lower ex scale fees. Q1 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, included a $1 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and also includes $5 million of integration costs. Total Q1 AFFO was $653 million, above our expectations due to strong operating performance. Q1 global MRR churn was 1.8%, the lowest level of churn in recent history and a reflection of our disciplined strategy of selling the platform to the right customer with the right application into the right asset. For 2022, we now expect MRR churn to average at the lower end of our 2% to 2.5% per quarter range. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on slides five through seven. APAC was the fastest-growing region on a year-over-year normalized basis at 13%, followed by the Americas and EMEA regions at 10% and 9%, respectively. The Americas region had another great quarter with strong broad-based bookings led by our Chicago, Dallas, New York and Washington, D.C. markets. Enterprises represented over half the region's bookings that we announce and we saw record channel activity as businesses continue to leverage platform Equinix to maximize their digital infrastructures flexibility and agility in the hybrid multi-cloud world. The region also saw a robust interconnection activity, adding 4,000 total interconnections and significant Internet exchange capacity led by our Sao Paulo market. Our EMEA region delivered its highest net bookings performance in three years with strong pricing and a healthy mix of retail activity with solid exports led by our Dubai, Istanbul, London and Milan markets. In EMEA, sustainability is an ever-increasing focus for our customers and communities, and our local leadership team continues to work to position Equinix as the industry thought leader at both the local and regional levels. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a solid quarter led by Australia, Japan and Singapore businesses, with traction increasing across the region for our digital services. India had another great quarter, and we're investing behind our momentum in the market with our newly announced Mumbai 3 IBX project as well as purchasing land for development in Chennai. And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to slide 8. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 billion of cash, an increase over the prior quarter, largely due to strong operating cash flow, offset by growth CapEx and our cash dividend. Shortly after the quarter end, we completed our fourth green bond offering raising $1.2 billion to further our commitment to sustainability leadership. With this latest financing, Equinix has issued approximately $4.9 billion of green bonds, making our company the fourth largest global issuer in the investment-grade green bond market. In early April, we are also pleased to have Moody's upgrade Equinix to Baa2 in line with S&P and Fitch while expanding our leverage targets. We're very appreciative of the support we see from Moody's. And importantly, we're delighted with the increased financial flexibility we now have across all three rating agencies. Looking forward, as stated previously, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to funding our growth opportunities with both debt and equity, while creating long-term value for our shareholders. Turning to slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $413 million, including seasonally lower recurring CapEx of $24 million. Also in the quarter, we opened three new retail projects in two markets, Muscat and Singapore, have purchased land for development in Mexico City. Revenues from own assets increased to 60% of our total revenues. Our capital investments delivered strong returns, as shown on slide 10. Our now 164 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Consistent with prior years, in Q1, we completed our annual refresh of IBX categorization. Our stabilized asset count increased by net six IBXs. These stabilized assets are collectively 87% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And please refer to slides 11 through 15 for our updated summary of 2022 guidance and bridges. Do note our 2022 guidance includes the anticipated financial results from the MainOne acquisition, but does not include any results related to the pending Entel acquisition, which is expected to close in Q2. Starting with revenues for the full year 2022, we're very pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the organic business and excited to report that we now expect our revenues to increase on a normalized and constant currency basis by 10% over the prior year. Relative to our prior guidance, we're increasing our revenues by approximately $90 million, which includes our improved operating performance and $50 million of revenues from MainOne. We expect 2022 adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 46%, excluding integration costs, an increase of about $40 million compared to our prior guidance, which includes $20 million from MainOne. And we now expect to incur $25 million of integration costs in 2022. And given the operating momentum in the business, we're raising our underlying 2022 AFFO by $22 million to now grow between 8% and 10% on a normalized and constant currency basis compared to the previous year, offset by the increased debt financing costs from the MainOne and Entel acquisitions. Note the MainOne is expected to be immediately accretive, and we expect the Entel acquisition to be accretive when closed. 2022 AFFO per share is expected to grow between 7% and 8% on a normalized and constant currency basis. 2022 CapEx is now expected to range between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, including approximately $170 million of recurring CapEx spend and about $60 million of on-balance sheet xScale spend. So let me stop here. I'll turn the call back to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thanks, Keith. In closing, we had a tremendous start to the year. The demand backdrop for the business remains robust as enterprises across the globe continue to aggressively prioritize digital transformation and service providers expand their infrastructure globally in response to this demand. Data is being created, moved, manipulated, and stored at unprecedented levels. And the need to distribute infrastructure and position it in proximity to the broader digital ecosystem is fueling outsized demand for the distinctive value proposition and platform equities. Growth continues to outpace our Analyst Day expectations, thanks to strength across multiple simultaneous growth vectors for the business, expanding geographic reach, accelerating adoption of digital services, low churn, positive pricing trends and strong channel execution. We continue to leverage our market-leading scale and expansive balance sheet to deliver new capacity, even in an increasingly challenging macro environment. And our bold future-first sustainability agenda guides and rallies our team as we collectively pursue our shared purpose to be the platform where the world comes together to create the innovations that enrich our work, our life and our planet. We are delighted with the ongoing performance of the business, optimistic about the road ahead and remain keenly focused on delivering distinctive and durable value to our customers and to you, our shareholders. So let me stop there, and open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Okay. Good evening. Thanks so much. I think you've talked a couple of times about the macro environment. There's concerns about recession risk in Europe. Could you just talk to what you've seen in sort of March and April from ITs, CIOs, et cetera, in the European market specifically? And perhaps, we could also just -- on the power side, we've seen significant increases there. You talked about the hedges. And obviously, the guidance is good to see. But how should we think about the sort of the medium to longer term when those hedges need to get replaced? Thank you.\nCharles Meyers: Sure. Thanks, Simon. I'll start, and Keith can add on as you wish. It's -- we had a great quarter in Europe. So big kudos to the sales team there. Johan Arts, our sales leader, just pulled together a tremendous quarter. And I think -- we've asked him to continue to reshape that business as we've shifted our revenue mix there into really the sweet spot of sort of the small to midsized deals. We're seeing great momentum there. And again, we talked a few quarters ago about accelerating growth there back to sort of prior levels, and we've certainly delivered on that forecast this year or this quarter with that back at 9%. So -- and pipeline looks good. So I would say that the broader macro environment in terms of the prioritization of digital transformation and kind of what we're seeing from technology and IT buyers continues to look good, and I think a high degree of relevance in terms of how they're looking at us and the role that we play in that. So overall, I continue to feel very good about that part of the world. So -- from a power perspective, as we said previously, we're kind of pretty much entirely hedged where we can be in Europe. And so we have not seen substantial impacts there. We are seeing elevated rates in terms of -- so as our -- but we have a lot of runway as we look at our hedges and are continuing to build our hedge positions for 2023 and beyond. But the hedge -- the success of our hedging program, I think, gives us a lot of visibility and runway to figuring out when we need to pass those through and at what levels. And that's ongoing work. And we'll be, I think, in a good position going into 2023 to adjust to that.\nSimon Flannery: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And our next question is from David Guarino with Green Street. You may go ahead.\nDavid Guarino: Hey thanks. I have a question on the same-store cash gross profit declining. I think this is the first time we've seen it turn negative since you guys started disclosing that data. Was a lot of that due to the power cost in Singapore or was something else driving that?\nCharles Meyers: Yes, I mean, the same-store, the revenue growth is strong, and we did see some contribution to that 6% from APAC and Singapore, in particular. And I think there probably is some contribution from the -- on the cash gross margin side there as well associated with that. But overall, we were actually very pleased with the same-store growth performance because, as I said, less than half of that gain to up to the 6% is really impacted by the power PIs. It's really -- it's impacted more by the addition of the new assets into the mix and strength in the Americas, which has an oversized influence on the stabilized assets. So Keith, anything further to add there?\nKeith Taylor: Just as we've noted and it's embedded in our guidance is the impact coming from the power cost in Singapore having a knock-on impact not only on the Asia Pac market, but the overall performance of the business on a gross margin basis. So again, nothing out of what we expected. As Charles alluded to, the fact of the matter is that stabilized assets are growing at 6% on a recurring revenue basis. We have great momentum in the business, and we've now absorbed effectively with the Q1 results, the impact of the Singapore business. And so that's the business on a go-forward basis there.\nDavid Guarino: All right. That's helpful. And then one another quick one. It looks like you guys are building two new phases at your AT1 facility in Atlanta. Are you seeing any shift from tenants who want to relocate away from other colocation data centers in the Atlanta market?\nCharles Meyers: Yeah. I mean the Atlanta market has been good. We continue to see demand there, and we've been making some of our own transition in terms of really attracting and motivating the network density into the AT1 facility on Peachtree. And so it's -- and again, you certainly see competitive wins in that market as well as just net new customers. So it's been a good market. We're continuing to invest there in terms of new capacity, as you noted, and we feel good about that market overall.\nDavid Guarino: Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: And our next question is from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead.\nJon Atkin: Thank you. I was interested on the energy topic. You're currently hedging presumably at elevated rates, and I just wondered what sorts of applications that might have down the road if energy prices were to normalize. Do you see any exposure in terms of pushback from customers? And then on the other end, just any more color around pricing actions. You mentioned about power related PIs, but anything else about just what's pricing renewal discussions, FastConnect and any color around how pricing is evolving? Thanks.\nCharles Meyers: Sure. Yeah. I mean, because where we're hedged now is in the rising rate environment as we have these feathered hedges over multiple years. We're hedged essentially below the prevailing market rate. And so -- and in a rising rate environment, what that provides is actually some protection to the customer against those market rates, because we'll be able to roll them in more gradually. And so that's our effect that we see. Again, as hedges roll-off and you've hedged at increasing rates, you are chasing that up. But again, it provides a net benefit there. And the customer will have an expectation as they see what the market rate is even in their own personal power consumption. There's generally a broader expectation that they're going to see some sort of a rise, and we can mitigate that to some degree. So I think the hedging and the success of our hedging, and that's the way it's worked for us in rising rate environments over time. And so we feel generally good about that. As I said, we're well-ahead of that planning cycle as we build our hedges for 2023 and beyond. So anything further to add there, Keith? And then on pricing, yeah, actually, we had -- continue to have strong pricing -- positive pricing actions. We have increased list pricing meaningfully. And I think that we're continuing to evaluate that in terms of -- and that's partially an implication of an artifact of increasing unit costs and other effects in the business beyond power like labor, for example. But that tends to work its way into the business slowly overtime as you see some of that. And we continue to see just a really strong response to the value proposition on a value basis. And so we have been increasing net pricing beyond power as well.\nKeith Taylor: Jon, if I might just add, I think, it's also important to note -- again, we didn't talk about it specifically, but the net pricing past pricing actions this quarter were substantial even when you take out the increased power pricing. And so when we look at our overall growth rate, you could take out the full implication of our -- of the pricing increases associated with power, and you still have a growth rate of greater than 9% on a normalized and constant currency basis. So yeah, it does have some impact. But the reality is it's the fundamental business that is driving the growth there on the top line. And that leaves us open to, as Charles said, the discussion of what happens later as inflation continues to take hold. What do we do with our pricing in addition to our list price adjustments? So overall, I'd just say that I think we're in a really good position from a pricing perspective. You can see in our blended MR per cap. And even when you sort of discount out the impact of power pricing associated with our current price increases, you still see a nice fundamental increase in our overall pricing on a per capita basis.\nJon Atkin: Just two quick ones and a follow-up, churn, can it remain on a sustainable basis at kind of these below average rates? And then demand seems elevated, and you had obviously a strong result last quarter and a strong guide. And does that feel sustainable as well in terms of enterprise retail colo demand? Or is there some sort of a catch-up dynamic where you're seeing some buying that was catch-up, but it might normalize from here and demand might go back to normal levels, or do you see elevated demand indefinitely? Thanks.\nCharles Meyers: Yeah. I'll start with the demand piece. I think we just continue to see an increasing overall addressable market as people continue to prioritize digital transformation its become such a central part of how people are looking to compete in the modern age that. And the nature of digital infrastructure has continued to change so much as they adopt public cloud, as that becomes a prominent part of their infrastructure strategy, as they think about factors like data sovereignty and application performance and application modernization and the complexity of networking in a sort of hybrid and hybrid cloud world. All of those things really lend themselves well to our value proposition. And I think people are seeing us increasingly relevant to those discussions. And so -- and that's really resulted in what you're seeing, which is several strong quarters of bookings in a row, record levels. And as Keith said in his script, our pipeline continues to look strong. So this isn't a matter of sort of emptying the coverage. We continue to see a growing pipeline. We see record levels of pipeline in our digital services portfolio and continue to see all elements of the business really, really respond strongly from a demand perspective. So we're not seeing any fading of that. It does not feel in any way to us like some sort of catch-up, but instead a more sustained level of demand for the business. And then, relative to churn, we've always said, the best way to reduce churn over time is to put the right business into the platform to begin with. And I think our strategy is really paying off there. And we always are -- always caution people in terms of churn can move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. But if you look at eight-quarter trend or a 12-quarter trend on churn, I think it will start to reveal to you that the downward trend is, in fact, I think, sustainable. Again, I wouldn't want to bet on every quarter being where this one is. But I do think that we have demonstrated sustainable downward trajectory on our churn.\nJon Atkin: Thank you.\nCharles Meyers: Thanks, Jon.\nOperator: Our next question is from Aryeh Klein with BMO Capital Markets. You may go ahead.\nAryeh Klein: Thank you. Maybe, just following up on the power questions. The expectation with Singapore was for the impact to moderate in the second half of the year. And since the original guidance is provided, the backdrop has obviously shifted a little bit with Russia and Ukraine, so have the view shifted on the pace of improvement that you're expecting for the second half of the year?\nCharles Meyers: Yes, a little bit. I would say, overall, look, the big power issue is really Singapore. It's very much on the margin in any other places. I think, going forward, I think we might see more of -- we have the planning to do in 2023 and beyond as power -- as hedges roll off and as we think about that, as I commented earlier, but I think that's more of something we have plenty of visibility to and an ability to respond to. As it relates to this year, Singapore is by far the overwhelming issue. And there's not a ton of change from what we said last quarter. I think, Q1 was actually a little better than we expected. And then the back half of the year might be a little higher than we had originally forecasted, but they're kind of going to come out kind of in roughly the same place. We now have over 50% of our load hedged or locked in rate-wise in Singapore. So we have better visibility of that. And I don't think a ton of variability and outcome from here. We'll continue to update you, if that changes. But not a big change, probably slightly more on the back end and less in this -- we had a better quarter this quarter than what we had in that original forecast. But on a full year basis, really roughly what we had said previously.\nAryeh Klein: Got it. And then in the Americas, you've had several quarters in a row, really strong bookings, and the growth rate accelerated. As we look ahead, I think over 70% of cabinets are outside the Americas in the development pipeline. How should we think about occupancy from utilization rates from here? Its obviously stepped up. What is the kind of level off or get to before you have to add more significantly to the build?\nCharles Meyers: Yes, a good question. Good question. I think that we have a fair amount of headroom in a lot of markets in the Americas, right? We're at a lower overall utilization rate there on a much bigger business. So there's plenty of capacity to sell. So I'm sure my sales teams are hearing me say that. So they're playing to go around. And the Americas business has performed exceptionally well. And another shout-out to Arquelle Shaw, our senior sales leader in the Americas. And I think that business is really humming and delivering strong sales execution. And so, you're right. A lot of the investment is going to -- going outside the US, but we've also are topping up in key markets in the US and in the Americas broadly to meet the demand there. So we feel good about our ability to both deliver the new capacity and to sell it. And we've got a new President of the Americas coming online, Tara Risser, and she's a tremendously customer-centric executive. And very excited about that. So I feel -- we feel great about the trajectory in the Americas. Again, I think plenty of opportunity to grow into the capacity that is there and drive utilization up. And we will continue to invest where there are markets that we start to see sort of pinch points out there in the future. And so overall, I feel really good about our ability to continue to put capacity online and sell it aggressively.\nQ \u2013 Aryeh Klein: Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi. You may go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. Just thinking through some of the comments, Charles earlier on the call talked about hybrid cloud, and you have hyperscale through the xScale. And you have, of course, the retail-centric business. And as you have more enterprise customers, are you thinking about ways that Equinix can increasingly serve their hybrid needs and go beyond retail to some enterprise deployments that they may be looking at to retain as part of the hybrid cloud architecture?\nCharles Meyers: Yes. I mean I think you're getting that sort of enterprise LFP and whether or not there is a sort of intermediate offer there between xScale. I would tell you that we, again, continue to -- if those needs are in the context of a broader platform requirement and how a customer is thinking about their digital transformation, then we will talk to them about how we might do that and where we might be able to meet that need. But again, the sort of the larger footprint, more commodity sort of colo enterprise requirement, isn't a major focus for us. In fact, as I talked about, we've really been retooling our revenue mix in markets like Europe to really focus on the sweet spot of the retail business, interconnection-edge, ecosystem-centric that delivers superior MRR per cab. It delivers superior retention. And that's what you're seeing show up in the business, better MRR per cab, lower churn, et cetera. So we've got to stick to the strategy that continues to drive the performance in the business. And I would tell you what we're seeing. You saw -- on occasion, you do see large enterprise-type needs. And we'll partner with enterprises and thinking that through. But I will tell you that, for the most part, I think a lot of times, customers are saying, 'Hey, we're going to put -- we're going to use a mix of public cloud and private cloud, and we really need to place our data in a sort of -- in more of an inter-cloud kind of location to drive performance and to meet statutory requirements, et cetera. And so I feel really good about the portfolio that we have. And I actually think the real -- a big opportunity with us on the enterprise side is the digital services portfolio. Really, delivering them Metal -- they're finding very well Metal is a value proposition because it helps them mitigate their technology life cycle management. It helps them be more agile, more scale, more rapidly move capacity around as they need it and as customer demand mandates that for them. And then Network Edge is a way that they really are thinking about retooling and rethinking networking in a cloud-centric world. And then, of course, Fabric, you see the momentum that we have there. And so I feel good about the portfolio, and we're going to -- we stood up the digital services BU and are going to continue to make some investments there, and I think that's going to position us really well for continued enterprise momentum. So really long answer to your question, but I think we'd be very selective about that. We don't see a big priority on sort of large footprint, lower margin profile kind of business.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. You may go ahead.\nErik Rasmussen: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. So this quarter, we're expecting really good strength from hyperscalers. And as it relates to your xScale business, considering sort of this elevated demand environment, what would you say are some of the hurdles you're seeing as you think about meeting this demand?\nCharles Meyers: Well, I mean it's -- I think the business is executing really well. We're not sort of trying to chase every bit of hyperscale that's out there. We've got an aggressive but an appropriate plan that we think delivers strategic value to the overall platform. We're focused on a relatively small number of sort of global hyperscalers that we think are critical to how the overall cloud macro plays out and are focused on them. I think it's really just being able to continue to deliver capacity. And so we've been more aggressive about land banking. We're continuing to work to make sure that we have the capacity and the key equipment necessary. So our supply chain team has been active both in terms of both our -- the xScale side of our business and retail to ensure that we are buying inventory or making forward commitments to ensure the availability of equipment to get projects delivered on time. So I think that's going to be the key thing for us. And right now, we feel very good about that. In fact, since the last quarter, we talked about -- over a couple of quarters ago I guess it was we talked about having roughly $100 million of pre-commitment and inventory in place to try to mitigate against supply chain, we've nearly doubled that to continue to sort of anticipate and head off any pinch points that exist in the supply chain. So I think we're doing a good job there, but I think that's the area that we need to continue to focus on. And I guess the proof is in the pudding in that our delivery dates are all, on average, a few outliers here and there, but on average, we're no more than a week or two delayed on projects. And so being continuing to deliver on-time deployments.\nErik Rasmussen: Great. That's helpful. And then maybe just on M&A. You've obviously been pretty disciplined in your approach historically. But in the current environment, multiples have moved up. Just wondering if the right opportunity were to come up, are there scenarios where you would stretch your comfort level to maybe not lose out on a particular deal? And what would that type of deal look like?\nCharles Meyers: Yes. Look, I mean we -- every deal is a little bit different. I mean I would say that there are good examples in our past of where we have stretched in what terms of maybe a multiple that we paid based on our belief about our ability to sort of buy that multiple down over time through growth. And I think Metronode and Infomart are probably a couple of examples that pop to mind that we've both turned out to be really great deals for us. But we're going to be appropriately disciplined. We're not going to win every deal, but we also believe that M&A is a key tool in the toolbox. And we think there are opportunities out there for us to continue to extend and scale our platform and our priorities kind of remain the same. Key interconnection assets, scale in markets where we're seeing success and continue to extend our platform geographically into the markets that matter. And I think all those types of opportunities are available. So -- and we've got the balance sheet to pull it off, I think. So we'll be out there, we'll be aggressive. And in cases where we think it makes sense to stretch, we will. And where we don't, we won't.\nErik Rasmussen: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. You may go ahead.\nBrendan Lynch: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. To start, we're about one year on from your long-term guidance when you issued your long-term guidance for a 50% adjusted EBITDA margin by 2025. Your guidance this year is implying a 140 basis point contraction for some of the well-documented reasons that have been discussed already. I just want an update, if you would, on the ability to achieve that long-term target. And what are some of the elements that are directly within your control on the cost side that could help get you there if you can't get there through pricing power?\nCharles Meyers: Yes. Great question, Brendan. One, obviously, that we are very focused on and think a lot about. I'll start with just simply saying that we continue to see 50% as an appropriate long-term target for EBITDA margin. There's a number of moving parts on the overall margin trajectory of the business. And as you said, some -- we've talked about many of those with power, particularly the Singapore power situation being central to that. We kind of already talked about that dynamic, which is -- were a little better than expected in Q1. Back half of the year might be a little bit worse than what we had originally forecast, but not a major shift there. As we enter next year, we'd expect to see APAC margins normalize either through moderating rates, and we can't really predict that fully. Or even if they don't moderate by us, essentially, putting additional PIs through and getting in line with the broader market. And so I think we'll see margin normalization there. And we continue to drive and expect continued operating leverage in the business in the back half of the year from several of our targeted efficiency programs in the business. And so we do think we need to have other levers available to continue to drive operating leverage. But we also may make some investments in quarter ahead, I think, given the tremendous booking strengths that we're seeing. So I don't think that would be surprising to anybody. So bottom line, we'll give you more detailed guidance on the 2023 and beyond margin profile as that becomes more clear. But I think the really critical takeaways are that: one, we continue to see 50% as an achievable target; and two, that we really remain confident that we can deliver against the Analyst Day AFFO per share growth targets through some combination of top line growth and appropriate operating leverage. And at the end of the day, that's really our lighthouse metric is driving that AFFO per share growth.\nBrendan Lynch: Great. Thanks. That's helpful. And maybe just one follow-up on the churn profile or trajectory. In the past, some of your acquisitions have kind of had a customer product mismatch where we saw an uptick in churn, specifically with the Verizon assets. I wonder if there's anything like that with any of the recent acquisitions that you've made that might cause churn to increase?\nCharles Meyers: Yeah. Really good question. Generally, we don't see that happening. I think a number of the \u2013 I think Bell was a little bit more aligned, maybe a little \u2013 maybe a little bit of that, and we'll continue to reshape that customer mix a bit, but much smaller scale than Verizon was in a bit of a different dynamic there. And then some of the other ones, I think, are more, more in line with kind of the overall customer profile or much smaller in their overall scope. So there's certainly some of that you inevitably see in M&A, but I wouldn't see anything on the horizon that would meaningfully tick that up.\nBrendan Lynch: Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.\nSami Badri: Hi. Thank you. I had one question and a follow-up. For the first question, I think you talked a little bit about the Americas business. And I just wanted to hit on specifically Americas MRR per cab and how it was down quarter-on-quarter and 1Q 2022. I know there were some adjustments and there was also a footnote, but I just kind of wanted to just get a better idea on what's going on there? And then the second question is regarding the $42 million of increased outlook visibility. Which regions are providing the strength for that $42 million?\nCharles Meyers: Sure. Let me \u2013 yeah, and recap, I'll give you a little bit of a more holistic view and then comment on Americas. And Keith just commented on this, we saw a nice uptick in overall in MRR per cap on a global basis. I think it's driven in meaningful part by significant organic strength in Europe and then some uptick in APAC in definitely with the PI \u2013 Power PI and Singapore contributing to that. But more than half of that is really driven, on an overall global basis, is driven by underlying organic strength in the business. In the Americas, we \u2013 there are a couple of moving parts there. We've always encouraged people to kind of look at a multi-quarter average since that metric can really be more volatile depending on several factors. And we saw a few of those factors. We saw some settlement activity in the Americas that was a one-time thing. We saw a large install, which is not yet ramped. And so you get the cabs, but not as much revenue. And then finally, we get \u2013 had a little bit of a price action associated with the very large renewal we did with NASDAQ, which was a huge win for us, but had a little bit of downward impact on that. But overall, I think nothing of concern. I think the MRR per cab in the Americas is still exceptionally healthy. And I think, we'd continue to be able to feel like we can continue to manage it at or above those levels.\nKeith Taylor: So I'd just add, just on to what Charles said there. The other thing that, as you probably recognize, we put Bell Canada's assets into our metrics last year or the end of last year, and they come at a lower MRR per cab than the average rate. And as a result, you've seen the dilutive impact of that, coupled with the fact that Canadian business continues to perform well, and so you've got a little bit of a mix on a go-forward basis. The last thing I would say is the currencies, again, this is a US dollar denominated number. And so you see that, the impact of lower currencies, we're not neutralizing it when we report on the non-financial metric page we do on the regional breakout page. But all you've got the impact of currencies influencing given the strength of the US dollar. It's just Japan is down about 12%. As an example, year-to-date, we've got other markets that have taken a little bit of a hit relative to the US dollar. So there are a number of things that are going on. But fundamentally, this is not anything to worry about. In fact, we're seeing greater strength in the business given the pricing profile that we have. And so we've not put a lot of focus on that particular metric.\nCharles Meyers: Keith, do you want to comment on the regional strength -- the regional breakout of the MRR system?\nKeith Taylor: Yeah. And then as regards to the regional, the profitability, as we said, $42 million of incremental EBITDA, $20 million is coming from MainOne. You've got $2 million coming from currencies. Again, that gives you a sense of the strength of our hedge positions on a currency basis. The financial impact of the business is very relatively de minimis for the rest of the year under current course and speed. So that feels good. So, relating to the organic business, you're seeing strong broad-based performance across the business. One of the comments that Charles made is we're seeing strength in all three regions in the world. And because of that strength in the top line is driving profitability in the top line, we think -- again, as you appreciate, in the US or the Americas business, we make corporate decisions and make accruals, and so we embed that a part of the corporate level there for the Americas region. But overall, the fundamental business across all three regions is strong. And the only thing I would add to that is, yeah, you see the fluctuation in Asia Pacific, and that's specific to the Singapore matter that Charles has spoken of. And again, that's in our numbers now. It's in our run rate. And on a go-forward basis, we feel very good about the profitability in the business. And so you're seeing that growth and the momentum in the business, and it's right across the board.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Elias with Cowen and Company. You may go ahead.\nMichael Elias: Great. Thanks for taking the question. One quick question on the power cost side and the price increases. When you do pass through higher power cost to the customers, just wondering, are you structuring it as a temporary surcharge, or is that a permanent increase in the power costs embedded in that contract? That's my first question. And then, my second question is you mentioned earlier that you've raised your list prices meaningfully higher. Just as we think about the implications of that on MRR per cab going forward and kind of your renewal schedule, any color you can share on what you would expect over the medium to long-term to see the MRR per cab side? Thank you.\nCharles Meyers: Sure. Yeah. The power PIs, I think it all depends is the answer. Because I think that if we saw a reversion back to meaningfully lower rates, then I think we would adjust accordingly. And so, I do think that we kind of separate out more of the power-related pricing adjustments associated with power volatility from more structural sort of price levels and margin profiles within the business. And so, I think we're just going to have to navigate that in terms of -- but I do think the market saw a big uptick pass through those meaningful adjustments and then saw a reversion, I think we would make adjustments there. And so -- but I think it's going to very much depend and be something we'll have to look at on a market-by-market basis. And then pricing, I think in terms of its impact on MRR per cab, yes, I mean, I think that as we increase pricing due to various inflationary factors as well as due to the continued strength of our value proposition and our ability to continue to add more value for our customers, I think that's going to have a positive impact on our MRR per cab and just allow us to continue to preserve margins and drive the appropriate returns on capital. So we're going to have to continue to monitor that in terms of just how with the pace and the level of the inflationary forces in the business are. But right now, I think we've demonstrated that across the board we can make appropriate pricing adjustments and therefore feel like we can preserve that MRR per cab trajectory.\nMichael Elias: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.\nMatt Niknam: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. I have one on the balance sheet and then a quick follow-up. But on the balance sheet, I think, Keith, you referenced some of the ratings agency upgrades of late. It looks like you've got some additional leverage capacity you've yet to use. I'm just wondering what's the latest thinking around optimal leverage for the business given the expanding scale and stickiness of the platform. And then just as we think about funding for Entel, I think right now, after the $1 billion plus green bond, you're sitting on about $3 billion worth of cash pro forma for that. I get the sense the company is fully funded for the Entel acquisition. I'm just wondering, if we're thinking about it the right way, really trying to understand if the Entel deal will require any sort of incremental financing upon close or whether that's just a straight contribution when it closes? Thanks.\nKeith Taylor: Great questions. Let me first start with just the overall performance of the business. So the one we just did, as you know, that we base yield of 3.9% when we put treasury locks in place at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. And so we're able to trade it down to a 10-year term 3.35%. So exceedingly pleased with the performance of that transaction. That effectively fully funded the acquisition of Entel and MainOne. As we noted in the results, there's -- when we portion the increased interest expense this year relative to the two acquisitions, $8 million of it was allocated to MainOne and the other $22 million is running through our books right now. Now we've absorbed the cost. It's sitting there. It's in our guide, but we've yet to report the addition of the Entel acquisition. That will happen sometime in the second quarter, the May-June time frame. And as a result, you're going to get the net benefit of that. So effectively, what you're saying is you've already funded the cost side of the equation and will enjoy the, if you will, the income side of the equation yet. So that's that. As it relates to overall sort of our capital management, we do have the flexibility. We're 3.8x levered right now as a business. As we look forward, we still feel that the leverage in the 4-plus range is appropriate. We've got more flexibility with our three rating agencies, and we're very thankful for that. We've got the flexibility to draw down on debt. We think debt is -- despite the rising interest rates as of late, it's still a cheaper source of capital for us and, hence, why we took $1.2 billion off the table in April. We're looking obviously at other debt transactions over some period of time. Europe seems to be a good place given the differential in borrowing rates. And then we always will use a blend of debt and equity, largely because that's what we do. And I think that's what allows us to have the strength in which Charles referred to before. We can transact with a strong balance sheet with great success, given how we've structured ourselves. And so, the only other thing I'd say is we are looking forward just because what we fund today, we also are looking forward into 2023 and 2024, what is the capital needs of the business. So we're maintaining that flexibility as we look forward in periods of great volatility. We always like to strike, as I said in my prepared remarks, when we think it's appropriate to raise the capital. And given the strong balance sheet, we've used that flexibility and got into the market at times that we've chosen. And that's been very, very effective to us on a long-term basis. So all that is a long-winded response, I'd say that we have great flexibility. We're absorbing costs today without the income attached to them. And I'm excited about the opportunity on a go-forward basis. The business is performing exceedingly well, and it's going to give us an opportunity to continue to fund the growth that we see in the business. And I'll stop there.\nQ \u2013: That\u2019s great. I really appreciate all that color. Thanks.\nChip Newcom: This concludes our Q1 call. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Keith Taylor",
            "content": "Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. I do hope you're doing well. At Equinix, the team delivered another great quarter. We did better than anticipated. We experienced robust growth in the Americas and solid channel bookings, further expanding the universe of opportunity for our highly differentiated business and enjoyed meaningful inter and intra-region activity, a reflection of we're selling well across our ever-expanding footprint. Interconnection activity remains high both in the physical and the virtual level. Interconnection revenues represent 19% of our recurring revenues and are growing faster than the overall business. Our platform strategy continues to deliver outside its value, further separating us from others in our space. We had strong growth from our digital services products and continued momentum in the most recent acquisitions in Canada, India and Mexico. And our pipeline remains solid despite our record bookings. With a great start to 2022, we're raising our guidance across each of our core financial metrics. As we've said previously, we believe the diversity and scale of our business across sectors, markets and customers puts us in a highly favorable position to capitalize on all trends digital as well as manage the macro factors and volatility. We have no meaningful near-term exposure to rising interest rates. Our balance sheet strength continues to provide us with a strategic advantage, while allowing us to access the capital markets at times that are attractive to us. With regards to supply chain and inflation, we continue to deliver projects against our return expectations with limited delays given our ability to access and secure critical infrastructure components. And while the energy markets remain volatile, our hedging policies are helping us navigate this unusual period. These factors, when combined with the momentum we're seeing in our marketplace, enable us to remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver top line growth, strong and durable AFFO per share growth to our shareholders as well. Now let me cover the highlights for the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q1 revenues were $1.734 billion, up 10% over the same quarter last year and at the midpoint of our guidance due to better than expected MRR revenues, offset in part by the delayed timing of certain nonrecurring ex-scale fees. As we look forward, we expect a strong Q2 step-up in both recurring and non-recurring revenues. As we've noted before, non-recurring revenues attributed to customer installation work and xScale fee income are inherently lumpy and can move between quarters. Q1 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $2 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $800 million or 46% of revenues, up 5% over the same quarter last year at the high end of our guidance range due to strong operating performance and timing of spend, although it was impacted by the lower ex scale fees. Q1 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, included a $1 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and also includes $5 million of integration costs. Total Q1 AFFO was $653 million, above our expectations due to strong operating performance. Q1 global MRR churn was 1.8%, the lowest level of churn in recent history and a reflection of our disciplined strategy of selling the platform to the right customer with the right application into the right asset. For 2022, we now expect MRR churn to average at the lower end of our 2% to 2.5% per quarter range. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on slides five through seven. APAC was the fastest-growing region on a year-over-year normalized basis at 13%, followed by the Americas and EMEA regions at 10% and 9%, respectively. The Americas region had another great quarter with strong broad-based bookings led by our Chicago, Dallas, New York and Washington, D.C. markets. Enterprises represented over half the region's bookings that we announce and we saw record channel activity as businesses continue to leverage platform Equinix to maximize their digital infrastructures flexibility and agility in the hybrid multi-cloud world. The region also saw a robust interconnection activity, adding 4,000 total interconnections and significant Internet exchange capacity led by our Sao Paulo market. Our EMEA region delivered its highest net bookings performance in three years with strong pricing and a healthy mix of retail activity with solid exports led by our Dubai, Istanbul, London and Milan markets. In EMEA, sustainability is an ever-increasing focus for our customers and communities, and our local leadership team continues to work to position Equinix as the industry thought leader at both the local and regional levels. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a solid quarter led by Australia, Japan and Singapore businesses, with traction increasing across the region for our digital services. India had another great quarter, and we're investing behind our momentum in the market with our newly announced Mumbai 3 IBX project as well as purchasing land for development in Chennai. And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to slide 8. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 billion of cash, an increase over the prior quarter, largely due to strong operating cash flow, offset by growth CapEx and our cash dividend. Shortly after the quarter end, we completed our fourth green bond offering raising $1.2 billion to further our commitment to sustainability leadership. With this latest financing, Equinix has issued approximately $4.9 billion of green bonds, making our company the fourth largest global issuer in the investment-grade green bond market. In early April, we are also pleased to have Moody's upgrade Equinix to Baa2 in line with S&P and Fitch while expanding our leverage targets. We're very appreciative of the support we see from Moody's. And importantly, we're delighted with the increased financial flexibility we now have across all three rating agencies. Looking forward, as stated previously, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to funding our growth opportunities with both debt and equity, while creating long-term value for our shareholders. Turning to slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $413 million, including seasonally lower recurring CapEx of $24 million. Also in the quarter, we opened three new retail projects in two markets, Muscat and Singapore, have purchased land for development in Mexico City. Revenues from own assets increased to 60% of our total revenues. Our capital investments delivered strong returns, as shown on slide 10. Our now 164 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Consistent with prior years, in Q1, we completed our annual refresh of IBX categorization. Our stabilized asset count increased by net six IBXs. These stabilized assets are collectively 87% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And please refer to slides 11 through 15 for our updated summary of 2022 guidance and bridges. Do note our 2022 guidance includes the anticipated financial results from the MainOne acquisition, but does not include any results related to the pending Entel acquisition, which is expected to close in Q2. Starting with revenues for the full year 2022, we're very pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the organic business and excited to report that we now expect our revenues to increase on a normalized and constant currency basis by 10% over the prior year. Relative to our prior guidance, we're increasing our revenues by approximately $90 million, which includes our improved operating performance and $50 million of revenues from MainOne. We expect 2022 adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 46%, excluding integration costs, an increase of about $40 million compared to our prior guidance, which includes $20 million from MainOne. And we now expect to incur $25 million of integration costs in 2022. And given the operating momentum in the business, we're raising our underlying 2022 AFFO by $22 million to now grow between 8% and 10% on a normalized and constant currency basis compared to the previous year, offset by the increased debt financing costs from the MainOne and Entel acquisitions. Note the MainOne is expected to be immediately accretive, and we expect the Entel acquisition to be accretive when closed. 2022 AFFO per share is expected to grow between 7% and 8% on a normalized and constant currency basis. 2022 CapEx is now expected to range between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, including approximately $170 million of recurring CapEx spend and about $60 million of on-balance sheet xScale spend. So let me stop here. I'll turn the call back to Charles. Just as we've noted and it's embedded in our guidance is the impact coming from the power cost in Singapore having a knock-on impact not only on the Asia Pac market, but the overall performance of the business on a gross margin basis. So again, nothing out of what we expected. As Charles alluded to, the fact of the matter is that stabilized assets are growing at 6% on a recurring revenue basis. We have great momentum in the business, and we've now absorbed effectively with the Q1 results, the impact of the Singapore business. And so that's the business on a go-forward basis there. Jon, if I might just add, I think, it's also important to note -- again, we didn't talk about it specifically, but the net pricing past pricing actions this quarter were substantial even when you take out the increased power pricing. And so when we look at our overall growth rate, you could take out the full implication of our -- of the pricing increases associated with power, and you still have a growth rate of greater than 9% on a normalized and constant currency basis. So yeah, it does have some impact. But the reality is it's the fundamental business that is driving the growth there on the top line. And that leaves us open to, as Charles said, the discussion of what happens later as inflation continues to take hold. What do we do with our pricing in addition to our list price adjustments? So overall, I'd just say that I think we're in a really good position from a pricing perspective. You can see in our blended MR per cap. And even when you sort of discount out the impact of power pricing associated with our current price increases, you still see a nice fundamental increase in our overall pricing on a per capita basis. So I'd just add, just on to what Charles said there. The other thing that, as you probably recognize, we put Bell Canada's assets into our metrics last year or the end of last year, and they come at a lower MRR per cab than the average rate. And as a result, you've seen the dilutive impact of that, coupled with the fact that Canadian business continues to perform well, and so you've got a little bit of a mix on a go-forward basis. The last thing I would say is the currencies, again, this is a US dollar denominated number. And so you see that, the impact of lower currencies, we're not neutralizing it when we report on the non-financial metric page we do on the regional breakout page. But all you've got the impact of currencies influencing given the strength of the US dollar. It's just Japan is down about 12%.

But fundamentally, this is not anything to worry about. In fact, we're seeing greater strength in the business given the pricing profile that we have. And so we've not put a lot of focus on that particular metric. Yeah. And then as regards to the regional, the profitability, as we said, $42 million of incremental EBITDA, $20 million is coming from MainOne. You've got $2 million coming from currencies. Again, that gives you a sense of the strength of our hedge positions on a currency basis. The financial impact of the business is very relatively de minimis for the rest of the year under current course and speed. So that feels good. So, relating to the organic business, you're seeing strong broad-based performance across the business. One of the comments that Charles made is we're seeing strength in all three regions in the world. And because of that strength in the top line is driving profitability in the top line, we think -- again, as you appreciate, in the US or the Americas business, we make corporate decisions and make accruals, and so we embed that a part of the corporate level there for the Americas region.

It's in our run rate. And on a go-forward basis, we feel very good about the profitability in the business. And so you're seeing that growth and the momentum in the business, and it's right across the board. Great questions. Let me first start with just the overall performance of the business. So the one we just did, as you know, that we base yield of 3.9% when we put treasury locks in place at the end of last year and the beginning of this year.

            "name": "Charles Meyers",
            "content": "Thanks, Chip. Welcome to the call. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome also to all of you to our first quarter earnings call. We had a great start to 2022, delivering the best net booking performance in our history, fueled by strong demand across all three regions, robust net pricing actions and near-record low churn, resulting in our 77th consecutive quarter of top line growth, the longest such streak of any S&P 500 company. We executed more than 4,200 deals in the quarter across more than 3,100 customers, demonstrating both the scale and the consistency of our go-to-market machine. While there are a number of macroeconomic factors that we continue to proactively manage, including rising interest rates, inflation and geopolitical conflict, the business continues to perform exceptionally well. And underlying demand for digital infrastructure continues to rise as enterprises across the globe and in diverse sectors prioritize digital transformation and service providers continue to innovate, distribute and scale their infrastructure globally in response to that demand. Unfortunately, the war in Ukraine is still unfolding, and we continue to be part of the vigorous global response to that conflict. As stewards of key elements of the world's digital infrastructure, we're committed to doing our part in maintaining that infrastructure to support free and open communications and aid in humanitarian relief. While we do not have operations in Russia or Ukraine, our employees have shown incredible generosity supporting Ukrainian refugees, particularly our team in Poland. Looking more broadly at our responsibilities as a market leader, we continue to advance a bold future-first sustainability agenda that reflects our company's values across our environmental, social and governance initiatives. We recently published our 2021 corporate sustainability highlights, and I'm pleased to report continued progress, including a 3.6% increase in representation of women at leadership levels and a 20% increase in the number of employees, leveraging our well-being and our mental health benefits. We also continue to develop pathways and partnerships to enhance our diversity and create opportunities for historically underrepresented groups, both inside and outside of Equinix. As we work to address the urgency of climate change, I'm also proud, that Equinix is well on our way to meeting our science-based target commitments. In 2021, we achieved over 90% renewable energy coverage for our portfolio for the fourth consecutive year, while also improving the energy efficiency of our facilities by over 5% as measured by average annual power usage effectiveness, or PUE. A focus on sustainability continues to be top of mind for customers and partners, as they look to buy from and work with companies that have established ESG goals and commitments. As the world's digital infrastructure leader, we have a responsibility to harness the power of technology to create a more accessible, equitable and sustainable future, and we will continue to focus on the important issues that impact our stakeholders and our business. Now, turning to the results as depicted on slide three. Revenues for Q1 were $1.7 billion, up 10% over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 5% year-over-year, and AFFO was better than our expectations, again due to strong operating performance. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our data center services portfolio continues to extend our differentiated scale and reach, with 43 projects underway across 29 metros in 20 countries, including new projects in Atlanta, Mumbai, Sydney, Tokyo and Washington, D.C., as customers embrace our interconnected edge as a point of nexus for their hybrid and multi-cloud architectures and leverage our scaled digital ecosystems to enable and drive their digital agenda. According to IDC, by 2024, 65% of the Global 2000 will embed some sort of edge-first data stewardship, security and network practices into their organization's digital business processes, and we're already seeing the impact with an amazing 89% of recurring revenues, now coming from customers deployed in more than one metro. In April, we closed our acquisition of MainOne, extending platform Equinix into Nigeria, Ghana and Ivory Coast, bringing our global coverage to 69 metros across 30 countries. Nigeria, in particular, is emerging as an innovative and dynamic player in the global digital economy, representing a significant opportunity for the expansion of digital services and a key first step in our long-term strategy to extend our carrier-neutral digital infrastructure platform across Africa. In the quarter, we also announced our upcoming expansion into Chile, through the planned acquisition of multiple data centers from Entel, a leading Chilean telecommunications provider. Chile is the fourth largest economy in South America with the highest GDP per capita in the region. And Santiago is emerging as a technology hub, serving both regional cloud and content demand, as well as local enterprises. This transaction is expected to close in Q2 and will further solidify Equinix as the leading provider of digital infrastructure in Latin America. Turning to interconnection. Our industry-leading portfolio continues to outpace the broader business, growing 12% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, driven by a healthy uptick in connections across our top ecosystem. We added an incremental 8,900 total interconnections in the quarter and now have over 428,000 total interconnections on the platform. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 7% quarter-over-quarter and 25% year-over-year to greater than 24 terabits per second. And we continue to see expanding customer demand and accelerated growth across our digital services portfolio.  Equinix Fabric saw its highest ever virtual connection ads as customers employ an increasingly diverse set of end destinations and utilize fabric for a variety of use cases across cloud networking and backbone connectivity. Equinix Metal and Network Edge also had strong quarters as enterprises leverage these services for a variety of virtual deployments, increasing agility and helping them to mitigate supply chain challenges. Metal has the most net customer adds to its service since its launch, with several key enterprise wins and a healthy backlog as our go-to-market partnerships with Dell, Pure Storage and Mirantis all gained momentum.  Shifting to our xScale initiative. In March, we closed our Australian JV with PGIM, which is expected to provide more than 55 megawatts of capacity in the Sydney market when closed and fully built out. And in April, we closed our South Korea JV with GIC, which is expected to provide more than 45 megawatts to the rapidly growing Seoul market. We currently have 9 xScale builds under development with over 80 megawatts of incremental capacity, of which nearly two-thirds are already pre-leased. So now I'll cover some highlights from our verticals. Our network vertical had a great quarter with good momentum across all three regions and record channel activity with our key carrier partners. New wins and expansions included one of the largest ISPs in India, establishing network hubs in our Mumbai 1 and 2 IBS, a high-speed satellite broadband service for military and commercial markets, supporting its expansion into Australia; and Global Net, a specialty network expanding its footprint and upgrading connectivity to support its growing user.  And enterprise continues to be our fastest-growing vertical with a strong bookings quarter led by EMEA in the manufacturing and public sector subsegments. New wins and expansions included Technicolor, the creative services and technology company within the media and entertainment industry, establishing regional technology hubs utilizing the full suite of Equinix' digital infrastructure services.  The Global [indiscernible] choosing Equinix as their strategic partner, thanks to our robust digital offerings, connectivity to key financial institutions and our sustainability strategy, and [indiscernible], a global leader in the celebrations industry using network edges to enable cloud connectivity and allow private interconnection between sites as they continue with their digital transformation.  We were also proud to work with a global money center bank who leveraged our advanced ecosystems to enable a critical connection to the National Bank of Ukraine, where the UNICEF could distribute funds to those in need, to those that need it most as part of their humanitarian efforts.  Our cloud and IT services vertical had solid bookings in the quarter, led by the infrastructure subset, while adding new cloud on-ramps in Dubai, Rio de Janeiro and Stockholm. New wins and expansions included Digital Edge, a rapidly scaling global cloud hosting provider, who is expanding its infrastructure footprint across multiple regions as they add customers and products. And a leading SaaS company, leveraging Equinix for its distributed data and cloud strategy and expanding service portfolio.  The broadcast and streaming subsegments anchored a solid quarter of content and digital media, including expansions of the Fortune 75 Media Conglomerates, expanding across Platform Equinix to support streaming services and content production. A multinational consumer credit reporting company, enabling direct connectivity via Equinix to their financial services customers and Fastly, a global CDM expanding capacity and deploying network nodes in support of their edge compute strategy.  And finally, our channel program again delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of record bookings, accounting for roughly 40% of bookings and 60% of new logos. Reseller and alliance partners accounted for over 75% of channel bookings, as our partners continue to demonstrate tremendous leadership in helping customers quickly adopt new digital business models. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and digital first use cases with hybrid multi-cloud featuring prominently as the architecture of choice. We saw continued strength with strategic partners like AWS, Microsoft, Dell and Telstra, including a significant win in France with AT&T, helping a security services company consolidate data centers and interconnect to their choice of cloud providers. We'd also like to recognize AT&T business as our partner of the year for 2021. Proud to have worked together to drive digital first outcomes on complex and transformational projects, including the Equinix and AT&T connected cloud initiatives, benefiting hundreds of customers across multiple industries. Now let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results for the quarter. Thanks, Keith. In closing, we had a tremendous start to the year. The demand backdrop for the business remains robust as enterprises across the globe continue to aggressively prioritize digital transformation and service providers expand their infrastructure globally in response to this demand. Data is being created, moved, manipulated, and stored at unprecedented levels. And the need to distribute infrastructure and position it in proximity to the broader digital ecosystem is fueling outsized demand for the distinctive value proposition and platform equities. Growth continues to outpace our Analyst Day expectations, thanks to strength across multiple simultaneous growth vectors for the business, expanding geographic reach, accelerating adoption of digital services, low churn, positive pricing trends and strong channel execution. We continue to leverage our market-leading scale and expansive balance sheet to deliver new capacity, even in an increasingly challenging macro environment. And our bold future-first sustainability agenda guides and rallies our team as we collectively pursue our shared purpose to be the platform where the world comes together to create the innovations that enrich our work, our life and our planet. We are delighted with the ongoing performance of the business, optimistic about the road ahead and remain keenly focused on delivering distinctive and durable value to our customers and to you, our shareholders. So let me stop there, and open it up for questions. Sure. Thanks, Simon. I'll start, and Keith can add on as you wish. It's -- we had a great quarter in Europe. So big kudos to the sales team there. Johan Arts, our sales leader, just pulled together a tremendous quarter. And I think -- we've asked him to continue to reshape that business as we've shifted our revenue mix there into really the sweet spot of sort of the small to midsized deals. We're seeing great momentum there. And again, we talked a few quarters ago about accelerating growth there back to sort of prior levels, and we've certainly delivered on that forecast this year or this quarter with that back at 9%. So -- and pipeline looks good. So I would say that the broader macro environment in terms of the prioritization of digital transformation and kind of what we're seeing from technology and IT buyers continues to look good, and I think a high degree of relevance in terms of how they're looking at us and the role that we play in that. So overall, I continue to feel very good about that part of the world. So -- from a power perspective, as we said previously, we're kind of pretty much entirely hedged where we can be in Europe. And so we have not seen substantial impacts there. We are seeing elevated rates in terms of -- so as our -- but we have a lot of runway as we look at our hedges and are continuing to build our hedge positions for 2023 and beyond. But the hedge -- the success of our hedging program, I think, gives us a lot of visibility and runway to figuring out when we need to pass those through and at what levels. And that's ongoing work. And we'll be, I think, in a good position going into 2023 to adjust to that. Yes, I mean, the same-store, the revenue growth is strong, and we did see some contribution to that 6% from APAC and Singapore, in particular. And I think there probably is some contribution from the -- on the cash gross margin side there as well associated with that. But overall, we were actually very pleased with the same-store growth performance because, as I said, less than half of that gain to up to the 6% is really impacted by the power PIs. It's really -- it's impacted more by the addition of the new assets into the mix and strength in the Americas, which has an oversized influence on the stabilized assets. So Keith, anything further to add there? Yeah. I mean the Atlanta market has been good. We continue to see demand there, and we've been making some of our own transition in terms of really attracting and motivating the network density into the AT1 facility on Peachtree. And so it's -- and again, you certainly see competitive wins in that market as well as just net new customers. So it's been a good market. We're continuing to invest there in terms of new capacity, as you noted, and we feel good about that market overall. Sure. Yeah. I mean, because where we're hedged now is in the rising rate environment as we have these feathered hedges over multiple years. We're hedged essentially below the prevailing market rate. And so -- and in a rising rate environment, what that provides is actually some protection to the customer against those market rates, because we'll be able to roll them in more gradually. And so that's our effect that we see. Again, as hedges roll-off and you've hedged at increasing rates, you are chasing that up. But again, it provides a net benefit there. And the customer will have an expectation as they see what the market rate is even in their own personal power consumption. There's generally a broader expectation that they're going to see some sort of a rise, and we can mitigate that to some degree. So I think the hedging and the success of our hedging, and that's the way it's worked for us in rising rate environments over time. And so we feel generally good about that. As I said, we're well-ahead of that planning cycle as we build our hedges for 2023 and beyond. So anything further to add there, Keith? And then on pricing, yeah, actually, we had -- continue to have strong pricing -- positive pricing actions. We have increased list pricing meaningfully. And I think that we're continuing to evaluate that in terms of -- and that's partially an implication of an artifact of increasing unit costs and other effects in the business beyond power like labor, for example. But that tends to work its way into the business slowly overtime as you see some of that. And we continue to see just a really strong response to the value proposition on a value basis. And so we have been increasing net pricing beyond power as well. Yeah. I'll start with the demand piece. I think we just continue to see an increasing overall addressable market as people continue to prioritize digital transformation its become such a central part of how people are looking to compete in the modern age that. And the nature of digital infrastructure has continued to change so much as they adopt public cloud, as that becomes a prominent part of their infrastructure strategy, as they think about factors like data sovereignty and application performance and application modernization and the complexity of networking in a sort of hybrid and hybrid cloud world. All of those things really lend themselves well to our value proposition. And I think people are seeing us increasingly relevant to those discussions. And so -- and that's really resulted in what you're seeing, which is several strong quarters of bookings in a row, record levels. And as Keith said in his script, our pipeline continues to look strong. So this isn't a matter of sort of emptying the coverage. We continue to see a growing pipeline. We see record levels of pipeline in our digital services portfolio and continue to see all elements of the business really, really respond strongly from a demand perspective. So we're not seeing any fading of that. It does not feel in any way to us like some sort of catch-up, but instead a more sustained level of demand for the business. And then, relative to churn, we've always said, the best way to reduce churn over time is to put the right business into the platform to begin with. And I think our strategy is really paying off there. And we always are -- always caution people in terms of churn can move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. But if you look at eight-quarter trend or a 12-quarter trend on churn, I think it will start to reveal to you that the downward trend is, in fact, I think, sustainable. Again, I wouldn't want to bet on every quarter being where this one is. But I do think that we have demonstrated sustainable downward trajectory on our churn. Thanks, Jon. Yes, a little bit. I would say, overall, look, the big power issue is really Singapore. It's very much on the margin in any other places. I think, going forward, I think we might see more of -- we have the planning to do in 2023 and beyond as power -- as hedges roll off and as we think about that, as I commented earlier, but I think that's more of something we have plenty of visibility to and an ability to respond to. As it relates to this year, Singapore is by far the overwhelming issue. And there's not a ton of change from what we said last quarter. I think, Q1 was actually a little better than we expected. And then the back half of the year might be a little higher than we had originally forecasted, but they're kind of going to come out kind of in roughly the same place. We now have over 50% of our load hedged or locked in rate-wise in Singapore. So we have better visibility of that. And I don't think a ton of variability and outcome from here. We'll continue to update you, if that changes. But not a big change, probably slightly more on the back end and less in this -- we had a better quarter this quarter than what we had in that original forecast. But on a full year basis, really roughly what we had said previously. Yes, a good question. Good question. I think that we have a fair amount of headroom in a lot of markets in the Americas, right? We're at a lower overall utilization rate there on a much bigger business. So there's plenty of capacity to sell. So I'm sure my sales teams are hearing me say that. So they're playing to go around. And the Americas business has performed exceptionally well. And another shout-out to Arquelle Shaw, our senior sales leader in the Americas. And I think that business is really humming and delivering strong sales execution. And so, you're right. A lot of the investment is going to -- going outside the US, but we've also are topping up in key markets in the US and in the Americas broadly to meet the demand there. So we feel good about our ability to both deliver the new capacity and to sell it. And we've got a new President of the Americas coming online, Tara Risser, and she's a tremendously customer-centric executive. And very excited about that. So I feel -- we feel great about the trajectory in the Americas. Again, I think plenty of opportunity to grow into the capacity that is there and drive utilization up. And we will continue to invest where there are markets that we start to see sort of pinch points out there in the future. And so overall, I feel really good about our ability to continue to put capacity online and sell it aggressively.\nQ \u2013 Aryeh Klein: Thanks for the color. Yes. I mean I think you're getting that sort of enterprise LFP and whether or not there is a sort of intermediate offer there between xScale. I would tell you that we, again, continue to -- if those needs are in the context of a broader platform requirement and how a customer is thinking about their digital transformation, then we will talk to them about how we might do that and where we might be able to meet that need. But again, the sort of the larger footprint, more commodity sort of colo enterprise requirement, isn't a major focus for us. In fact, as I talked about, we've really been retooling our revenue mix in markets like Europe to really focus on the sweet spot of the retail business, interconnection-edge, ecosystem-centric that delivers superior MRR per cab. It delivers superior retention. And that's what you're seeing show up in the business, better MRR per cab, lower churn, et cetera. So we've got to stick to the strategy that continues to drive the performance in the business. And I would tell you what we're seeing. You saw -- on occasion, you do see large enterprise-type needs. And we'll partner with enterprises and thinking that through. But I will tell you that, for the most part, I think a lot of times, customers are saying, 'Hey, we're going to put -- we're going to use a mix of public cloud and private cloud, and we really need to place our data in a sort of -- in more of an inter-cloud kind of location to drive performance and to meet statutory requirements, et cetera. And so I feel really good about the portfolio that we have. And I actually think the real -- a big opportunity with us on the enterprise side is the digital services portfolio. Really, delivering them Metal -- they're finding very well Metal is a value proposition because it helps them mitigate their technology life cycle management. It helps them be more agile, more scale, more rapidly move capacity around as they need it and as customer demand mandates that for them. And then Network Edge is a way that they really are thinking about retooling and rethinking networking in a cloud-centric world. And then, of course, Fabric, you see the momentum that we have there. And so I feel good about the portfolio, and we're going to -- we stood up the digital services BU and are going to continue to make some investments there, and I think that's going to position us really well for continued enterprise momentum. So really long answer to your question, but I think we'd be very selective about that. We don't see a big priority on sort of large footprint, lower margin profile kind of business. Well, I mean it's -- I think the business is executing really well. We're not sort of trying to chase every bit of hyperscale that's out there. We've got an aggressive but an appropriate plan that we think delivers strategic value to the overall platform. We're focused on a relatively small number of sort of global hyperscalers that we think are critical to how the overall cloud macro plays out and are focused on them. I think it's really just being able to continue to deliver capacity. And so we've been more aggressive about land banking. We're continuing to work to make sure that we have the capacity and the key equipment necessary. So our supply chain team has been active both in terms of both our -- the xScale side of our business and retail to ensure that we are buying inventory or making forward commitments to ensure the availability of equipment to get projects delivered on time. So I think that's going to be the key thing for us. And right now, we feel very good about that. In fact, since the last quarter, we talked about -- over a couple of quarters ago I guess it was we talked about having roughly $100 million of pre-commitment and inventory in place to try to mitigate against supply chain, we've nearly doubled that to continue to sort of anticipate and head off any pinch points that exist in the supply chain. So I think we're doing a good job there, but I think that's the area that we need to continue to focus on. And I guess the proof is in the pudding in that our delivery dates are all, on average, a few outliers here and there, but on average, we're no more than a week or two delayed on projects. And so being continuing to deliver on-time deployments. Yes. Look, I mean we -- every deal is a little bit different. I mean I would say that there are good examples in our past of where we have stretched in what terms of maybe a multiple that we paid based on our belief about our ability to sort of buy that multiple down over time through growth. And I think Metronode and Infomart are probably a couple of examples that pop to mind that we've both turned out to be really great deals for us. But we're going to be appropriately disciplined. We're not going to win every deal, but we also believe that M&A is a key tool in the toolbox. And we think there are opportunities out there for us to continue to extend and scale our platform and our priorities kind of remain the same. Key interconnection assets, scale in markets where we're seeing success and continue to extend our platform geographically into the markets that matter. And I think all those types of opportunities are available. So -- and we've got the balance sheet to pull it off, I think. So we'll be out there, we'll be aggressive. And in cases where we think it makes sense to stretch, we will. And where we don't, we won't. Yes. Great question, Brendan. One, obviously, that we are very focused on and think a lot about. I'll start with just simply saying that we continue to see 50% as an appropriate long-term target for EBITDA margin. There's a number of moving parts on the overall margin trajectory of the business. And as you said, some -- we've talked about many of those with power, particularly the Singapore power situation being central to that. We kind of already talked about that dynamic, which is -- were a little better than expected in Q1. Back half of the year might be a little bit worse than what we had originally forecast, but not a major shift there. As we enter next year, we'd expect to see APAC margins normalize either through moderating rates, and we can't really predict that fully. Or even if they don't moderate by us, essentially, putting additional PIs through and getting in line with the broader market. And so I think we'll see margin normalization there. And we continue to drive and expect continued operating leverage in the business in the back half of the year from several of our targeted efficiency programs in the business. And so we do think we need to have other levers available to continue to drive operating leverage. But we also may make some investments in quarter ahead, I think, given the tremendous booking strengths that we're seeing. So I don't think that would be surprising to anybody. So bottom line, we'll give you more detailed guidance on the 2023 and beyond margin profile as that becomes more clear. But I think the really critical takeaways are that: one, we continue to see 50% as an achievable target; and two, that we really remain confident that we can deliver against the Analyst Day AFFO per share growth targets through some combination of top line growth and appropriate operating leverage. And at the end of the day, that's really our lighthouse metric is driving that AFFO per share growth. Yeah. Really good question. Generally, we don't see that happening. I think a number of the \u2013 I think Bell was a little bit more aligned, maybe a little \u2013 maybe a little bit of that, and we'll continue to reshape that customer mix a bit, but much smaller scale than Verizon was in a bit of a different dynamic there. And then some of the other ones, I think, are more, more in line with kind of the overall customer profile or much smaller in their overall scope. So there's certainly some of that you inevitably see in M&A, but I wouldn't see anything on the horizon that would meaningfully tick that up. Sure. Let me \u2013 yeah, and recap, I'll give you a little bit of a more holistic view and then comment on Americas. And Keith just commented on this, we saw a nice uptick in overall in MRR per cap on a global basis. I think it's driven in meaningful part by significant organic strength in Europe and then some uptick in APAC in definitely with the PI \u2013 Power PI and Singapore contributing to that. But more than half of that is really driven, on an overall global basis, is driven by underlying organic strength in the business. In the Americas, we \u2013 there are a couple of moving parts there. We've always encouraged people to kind of look at a multi-quarter average since that metric can really be more volatile depending on several factors. And we saw a few of those factors. We saw some settlement activity in the Americas that was a one-time thing. We saw a large install, which is not yet ramped. And so you get the cabs, but not as much revenue. And then finally, we get \u2013 had a little bit of a price action associated with the very large renewal we did with NASDAQ, which was a huge win for us, but had a little bit of downward impact on that. But overall, I think nothing of concern. I think the MRR per cab in the Americas is still exceptionally healthy. And I think, we'd continue to be able to feel like we can continue to manage it at or above those levels. Keith, do you want to comment on the regional strength -- the regional breakout of the MRR system? Sure. Yeah. The power PIs, I think it all depends is the answer. Because I think that if we saw a reversion back to meaningfully lower rates, then I think we would adjust accordingly. And so, I do think that we kind of separate out more of the power-related pricing adjustments associated with power volatility from more structural sort of price levels and margin profiles within the business. And so, I think we're just going to have to navigate that in terms of -- but I do think the market saw a big uptick pass through those meaningful adjustments and then saw a reversion, I think we would make adjustments there. And so -- but I think it's going to very much depend and be something we'll have to look at on a market-by-market basis. And then pricing, I think in terms of its impact on MRR per cab, yes, I mean, I think that as we increase pricing due to various inflationary factors as well as due to the continued strength of our value proposition and our ability to continue to add more value for our customers, I think that's going to have a positive impact on our MRR per cab and just allow us to continue to preserve margins and drive the appropriate returns on capital. So we're going to have to continue to monitor that in terms of just how with the pace and the level of the inflationary forces in the business are. But right now, I think we've demonstrated that across the board we can make appropriate pricing adjustments and therefore feel like we can preserve that MRR per cab trajectory."

In the interest of wrapping this call up in 1 hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. We had a solid close to 2023 as digital transformation and accelerating AI demand drove a record quarter for xScale leasing, robust pricing dynamics and continued momentum across our data center and digital services portfolios. For the full year, we delivered more than $8 billion of revenues, eclipsing 21 years of consecutive quarterly growth, all while driving AFFO per share performance above the top end of our long-term expectations. As we look ahead, we see our overall relevance to customers continue to rise with our global reach, highly differentiated ecosystems and full-range portfolio of services, positioning us as a key long-term partner to fuel digital transformation and unlock the enormous potential of AI. At the same time, many customers remain cautious in the face of macro uncertainty and are driving optimization across their broader IT infrastructure. Freeing up dollars for AI-related investments while still managing within tighter overall budgets. These dynamics, combined with capacity constrained in certain key markets continue to create cross currents in our business with solid gross demand and strong pricing dynamics being offset by more deliberate buying decisions and slightly higher levels of churn. Meanwhile, we continue to realize the benefits of efficiency investments over the past few years and are showing strong operating leverage in the business, allowing us to maintain our differentiated return on invested capital, expand margins and deliver outsized performance on AFFO per share which we continue to see as our lighthouse metric and the bedrock of long-term value creation. As work to make digital infrastructure more powerful, accessible and sustainable, we are building relationships as trusted advisers to our customers, innovating across our product portfolio, deepening our technology partnerships to solve customer challenges and maintaining our discipline to put the right customers with the right workloads into the right assets. This approach reinforces the kind of advantages of Platform Equinix as we focus our efforts in 2024 on 4 key areas: First, we plan to continue to expand our unmatched global reach, extending the 76 metros in 35 countries by year-end, including opening new markets in India, Indonesia, Malaysia and South Africa. We also intend to add much needed capacity in high-demand existing markets across all 3 regions, including significant retail phases in New York, Paris and Tokyo and accelerated investment in our xScale portfolio. Second, we intend to extend our interconnection leadership by combining the scalability and performance of physical interconnection and the agility of Equinix Fabric with a commitment to lead the way in the massive market of multi-cloud networking, with new innovations and products like our recently announced Equinix Fabric Cloud Router. Third, we'll continue to prioritize our future first sustainability strategy, making Equinix a clear partner of choice to help our customers track and see their sustainability goals and manage an increasingly complex global power landscape. And finally, we intend to unlock the power of platform clinics, embracing key partners and making it easier than ever to combine our value with theirs. So we can solve our customers' problems together. In particular, we focus on Gen AI as we join forces with incredible partners such as NVIDIA, to ensure that Platform Equinix is the place where private AI happens. Turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for the full year were $8.2 billion, up $925 million, a 15% increase year-over-year or a 9% increase, excluding the impact of power price increases. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.7 billion, up 11% year-over-year. AFFO was more than $3 billion for the first time, resulting in AFFO per share growth of 11% year-over-year. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. On the AI front, we saw strong momentum across the value chain in Q4 as we cultivated key partnerships and one significant opportunities. While still early, Gen AI has the capacity to transform every industry and is poised to accelerate rapidly. By 2026, Gartner predicts over 80% of enterprises have used Gen AI APIs and models or deployed Gen AI-enabled applications in production environments, up from just 5% in early 2023. We're leaning into this opportunity and recently announced our expanded partnership for IBX private cloud at Equinix. This new service provides customers a fast and cost-effective way to adopt advanced AI infrastructure that's operated and managed by experts globally. So enterprises can move quickly, while balancing performance requirements, a need for cloud adjacency and a rapidly increasing desire to maintain control of critical enterprise data. We're seeing strong interest in this service across all 3 regions with early adoption from digital leaders in biopharma, financial services, software, automotive and retail subsegments. Early wins in this partnership include a Fortune 100 global biopharma company who will create an AI of excellence to accelerate its research and development process and shorten time to market for new medications. Our data center services portfolio continues to scale with 9 new data center openings since our last earnings call. Given the strong underlying demand for digital infrastructure and the long duration in delivering new capacity, we continue to invest broadly across our global footprint. We currently have 49 major projects underway in 35 markets across 21 countries including 11 xScale builds representing nearly 20,000 cabinets of retail and more than 50 megawatts of xScale capacity through 2024. Wins this quarter included a European biotechnology company, exiting their traditional data centers in favor of a global network dense, hybrid and multi-cloud environment, including liquid cooling requirements. Andorin Holding [ph], a Turkish conglomerate, mainly serving as a strong global automotive supply company, expanding with Equinix to support their operations across 15 countries. Shifting to our xScale initiative, the wave of hyperscale demand to support AI and cloud is translating into robust demand in pre-leasing activity. Since our last earnings call, we leased 90 megawatts of capacity across 6 assets in EMEA and APAC, including approximately 32 megawatts leased at the start of the year. This brings total xScale leasing to 300 megaport [ph] globally. Wins this quarter included supporting strategic Gen AI workloads as well as the hyperscalers first-scale liquid cooling deployment at Equinix. Looking ahead, we have a meaningful pipeline of opportunities to drive continued xScale momentum in the quarters to come. Turning to our industry-leading global interconnection franchise, we now have more than 462,000 total interconnections deployed on our platform. In Q4, interconnection revenue stepped up 8% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis and we added an incremental 4,300 organic interconnections for the quarter. We, again, had healthy gross adds activity, offset somewhat by continued grooming and consolidations into higher bandwidth connections. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 22% year-over-year, to nearly 36 terabits per second, led by expansion from existing customers. Additionally, during the quarter, we added 4 new native cloud on-ramps in Bogota, Calgary and Zurich. Equinix customers can now enjoy low latency access to multiple native cloud on-ramps in 37 metros, including 8 out of the 10 world's largest metros by GDP. Wins this quarter included a leading European quantum computing company, offering its technology through Equinix Metal and Equinix Fabric, enabling different industries to explore potential use cases in quantum computing. And on insurance, a South African insurance company expanding in EMEA, leveraging Equinix Fabric and a managed service solution to be ready to begin trading. In our digital services portfolio, we saw continued momentum as Equinix Metal and Network Edge drove attractive pull-through to Equinix Fabric. In January, we announced the general availability of Equinix Fabric Cloud Router, a new virtual routing service to simplify enterprises complex cloud-to-cloud and hybrid cloud networking challenges by providing an easy-to-configure enterprise-grade multi-cloud routing service that can be deployed in under a minute. Customers can deploy Equinix Fabric Cloud Router in all 58 Equinix fabric-enabled metros globally, with low latency connectivity to all the major cloud providers as well as hundreds of other service providers. Key digital wins included NetApp, who expanded their partnership with Equinix to deliver a Bare Metal service solution, a comprehensive compute, network and storage infrastructure stack with low latency connections to major public clouds. And a leading semiconductor company, establishing a cloud adjacent storage presence using Equinix Metal and Pure Storage with integration into AWS. Our channel program delivered another good quarter, accounting for 35% of bookings and over 50% of new logos. We saw continued growth from partners like HPE, HCL, NVIDIA and WWT, with wins across a wide range of industry verticals and digital first use cases. Wins this quarter included supporting a consumer health care company's business unit spin-off with Dell, setting up a hybrid IT environment by leveraging colocation and cloud for their SAP environment in London and Singapore. Now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter.\nKeith Taylor: Great. Thanks, Charles and good afternoon to everyone. As highlighted by Charles, we had a solid end to 2023. The Equinix team continued to execute across all levels of the organization to ensure our strategy as the world's digital infrastructure company continue to separate us from our peers. For the full year, our healthy gross bookings allowed the team to close almost 17,000 deals across more than 5,900 customers. Highlighting the diversity and strength of our unrivaled go-to-market engine. Then pricing activity, both in the quarter and throughout the year, created strong pricing dine resulting in normalized and constant currency MRR per cap yield stepping up $38 for the quarter and $127 for the year to $2,227 per cap [ph]. And we had record exceled leasing over the year while generating approximately $49 of nonrecurring xScale fee revenue in the quarter, primarily related to the EMEA region. On the sustainability front, we're pleased to again be listed on CDP's prestigious 2023 Climate Change A-List and again, to be recognized in JUST Capital's 2024 rankings as number one in real estate. As we look forward into 2024, our customers remain committed to all things digital and we believe we're the best manifestation of this opportunity as customers digitally transform their form, both in the cloud and through AI. Hence our enthusiasm about our position in the broader market and the opportunities that lay out for us. That said, we remain highly vigilant to the current market conditions and the impact on our customers. As mentioned last quarter, capacity constraints exist across a few of our markets, driving continued firm pricing power, albeit with some moderation to short-term growth. But as highlighted, on our expansion tracking slide, we have several new markets and additional capacity coming online later this year, with many other projects currently being contemplated as we look to extend our platform and drive growth. Also, we're very pleased with the operating leverage the business is delivering, benefiting from prior investments while being highly present future spend, resulting in improving adjusted EBITDA margins for the year. Importantly, our forward guide on our core metric being AFFO per share reflects our confidence in the long-term opportunity of our business, a preferential position, I believe, relative to any others in our space given the foundational differences of our platform. Additionally, our as reported guidance includes positive FX tailwinds due to the weaker U.S. dollar relative to '23 rates and net power price decreases as utility rates moderate across both our regulated and unregulated markets. Now let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Do note that all comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q4 revenues were $2.11 billion, up 15% over the same quarter last year due to strong recurring revenue growth, power price increases and record xScale nonrecurring fees. As you would expect, we're very pleased with the continued success of our xScale portfolio and the MRR and other fees generated, while also expecting a strong year in 2024. As noted previously, xScale MRR is inherently lumpy. For Q1, we expect MRR will step down sequentially, yet remain elevated as a turn of revenues due to strong APAC leasing activity in January. Q4 revenues or FX hedges includes a $3 million benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $920 million, or 44% of revenues, up 12% over the same quarter last year due to strong operating performance, although down quarter-over-quarter due to a $15 million charge related to our planned corporate real estate activities and a higher seasonal increase in repairs and maintenance spend. Q4 adjusted EBITDA net of our FX hedges had a minimal FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates and does include $4 million of integration costs. Global Q4 AFFO was $691 million, above our expectations due to strong business performance and favorable interest income, offset in part by higher seasonal recurring CapEx. The Q4 included a $4 million FX headwind compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q4 MRR terms stepped up to 2.4% in the higher end of our range due to customer optimizations. For 2024, we expect MRR churn to stay in the upper side of our churn range in the first half of the year, then moderate down in the second half and we expect this key metric average within our targeted 2% to 2.5% per quarter range for the year. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized and constant currency basis, EMEA was our fastest-growing MRR region at 27% due to power price increases. Followed by our APAC and Americas regions at 9% and 7% MRR growth, respectively. The Americas region had a solid quarter of strong new logo growth and firm pricing led by our Chicago, New York and Washington, D.C. metros. The Americas saw a step-up in cabinets billing in the quarter which now includes the intel assets in our nonfinancial metrics. EMEA business had a strong quarter led by our German business and our growth in urging market metros. We've had strong xScale activity across a number of our markets over the year. MainOne, our business in Ghana, Ivory Coast in Nigeria is performing better than our business case on a constant currency basis. Additionally, we signed our first deal in our Johannesburg 1 asset in South Africa which opens in Q3. And finally, the Asia Pacific region saw good performance in both our Japanese markets and in Mumbai. As it relates to our soon-to-be opened new markets in the region, we're actively building a strong pipeline of key ecosystem customers which we expect to close prior to the IBX openings. Also, we're pleased to have recently announced our first long-term PPA in APAC for 151 megawatts. To date, Equinix has executed 21 PPAs across Australia, France, Iberia, the Nordics and the U.S. which will generate more than 1 gigawatt of clean energy once operational. This will certainly help these markets accelerate their clean energy transition. And now looking at our capital structure. Please refer to Slide 8. Our net leverage remains low relative to our peers at 3.7x our annualized adjusted EBITDA. Our balance sheet increased approximately $32.1 billion [ph], including an unrestricted cash balance of $2.1 billion. Our cash balance includes the settlement of approximately $433 million of ATM food equity sales, the timing triggered by the increase in our Q4 quarterly cash dividend. Additionally, during the quarter, we executed an incremental $500 million of ATM forward equity sales which we expect to settle in late 2024. As I've noted previously, we expect to remain opportunistic in the timing and currency of our financing strategy, including our plans to refinance the $1 billion of debt maturing this year. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were $996 million, including recurring CapEx of $105 million. Since our last earnings call, we opened 7 retail projects, including 4 new data centers in Frankfurt, Kuala Lumpur, also Washington, D.C. In our xScale program, we opened 7 new projects and are now 87% leased or pre-leased for all of our operational and the Nose projects [ph]. During the quarter, we also purchased our London IBX asset and land for development in Mexico City. Revenue from owned assets increased to 66% of our recurring revenues, a meaningful step up in last quarter, highlighting the progress we've had around asset ownership and long-term control of our assets. Our capital expenditures delivered strong returns, as shown on Slide 10. Our 174 stabilized assets increased revenues by 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis or 5% excluding the benefit attributed to our power price increases. Our stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. As a reminder, unlike prior years, we plan to update our stabilized asset summary on the Q1 earnings call. And finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for an updated summary of 2024 guidance and bridges. Starting with revenues. For the full year 2024, we expect top line growth of 7% to 9% on an as-reported basis or 7% to 8% on a normalized and constant currency basis, excluding the impact of lower power cost pass through to our customers. We expect 2024 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 47%. And a 160 basis point improvement over last year due to strong operating leverage, targeted expense management initiative and power price decreases. We expect to incur $25 million of integration costs, primarily related to the main 1 business, projects which we expect to complete by end of year. AFFO is expected to grow between 9% and 12% compared to previous year. AFFO per share is expected to grow between 8% and 10% at the top end of our longer-term targeted range on both an as reported and normalized and constant currency basis. 2024 CapEx is expected to range between $2.8 billion and $3 billion, including about $220 million of recurring CapEx. And finally, after moving forward with the 25% increase in our per share cash dividend last quarter, we're holding our quarterly cash dividend cost at $4.26 per share for 2024. For the full year, the cash dividend will approximate $1.6 billion, a year-over-year increase of 19%, 100% which is expected towards from ordinary income given our expected strong operating performance. So, let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thanks, Keith. In closing, 2023 was a year of significant progress and focused execution against our ambitious agenda. While macro uncertainties persist, we anticipate continued economic recovery as we move through 2024 and believe this will continue to embolden customers to accelerate their digital transformation agendas with a keen focus on capturing business value through the extraordinary power of AI. Against this backdrop, demand for hybrid digital infrastructure should continue to grow and we're confident that the character of this demand will increasingly align with the distinctive advantages of Equinix, offering customer flexibility to deploy architectures that are more distributed, more cloud connected, more on-demand and more ecosystem rich than ever before. Features that have positioned Equinix once again as a leader in IDC MarketScape's worldwide assessment of data center services. Digital transformation is reshaping the fabric of our world, unlocking extraordinary possibilities and changing the basis for competition in almost every industry. Thanks to our distinct and durable advantages, Equinix is well positioned to capture these opportunities. Through the combined balance sheet power of Equinix and our JV partners, we'll continue to invest in supporting the vigorous demand for large-scale cloud and AI infrastructure around the world. Simultaneously, we will leverage the reach and connectivity of the world's leading retail platform to ensure that Equinix remains the best manifestation of the digital edge and a critical point of Nexus [ph] for modern cloud-centric architectures. Reaffirming our purpose to be the platform where the world comes together, enabling the innovations that enrich our work, our life and our planet. So, let me stop there and open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first caller is Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Two, if I could. The first one on the revenue guidance. I think at the Analyst Day, you talked about 18% revenue guidance. Is that -- is it the macro conditions causing the lower end to be at that 7% this year? And you've talked in the past, Charles, about in opportunities in the U.S. xScale, hyperscale market. Any update on your thoughts there?\nCharles Meyers: Sure. Thanks for the question. Yes. Look, I would say overall demand signal, I think, remains strong. But as a reference it, we continue to see what we're characterizing these crosscurrents in the business. And we've seen -- seen those great bearing levels of revenue headwind over the past few quarters, really from 3 sources, I'd say. The first 2 really related to macro, as you mentioned and the last one, a bit more Equinix specific. First, I think a bit of extension in the sales cycle. In Q4, a bit similar to what we saw in Q1 of '23 we saw more deal slippage which we really had not seen in Q2 and Q3. And so we thought that we were served in a better spot. But not a lot of lost deals but a number of deals that got pushed one or more quarters and that affected the quarter and the exit rate. Second, we saw churn as slightly elevated. And I think more towards the high end of our range which really reflects the continuation of the optimization activity that we -- and candidly, others across the infrastructure space have been highlighting throughout 2023. And then the last one I'd say is really more -- a little more specific to us. I think we continue to grapple with capacity constraints in some of our key markets. And that hits us on the gross fitting [ph] since we really can't accommodate larger footprint requirements in those markets and it hits us on the churn side, in some cases, as we work to try to free up capacity through doing some churn and though we've seen that certainly in markets like Cisco or so [ph]. All those factors combined to give us a little lighter Q4 and therefore a little bit lower exit run rate. And as you know, in a 95% recurring revenue business that kind of puts you behind the power curve. So our full revenue guide come in a little bit below our Analyst Day range. But again, as you saw, a lot of things, I think, to be -- to feel good about, given the xScale strength, I think we saw strong bookings performance in our retail sweet spot. A very healthy pipeline and starting to see signs of emergence of an even bigger AI-related pipeline. So we continue to be upbeat about the long-term opportunity. And importantly, I think despite the lower revenue guide, I think we're continuing to see robust pricing, really driving some operating leverage in the business when that continues to really translate to those attractive returns on capital. A growing dividend and AFFO per share performance that really is at the top end of our long-term guidance range. So I think that's the overall thing. And again, I think really, we'd love to be in that range, believe me. And it's disappointing that we're not. But I think we're giving you a realistic view of what we think the current market content will support and we're going to go like hell to try to beat that. So that's that. Relative to U.S. xScale [ph], yes, we are absolutely working on how we're going to continue to be more aggressive in this market. We think there is opportunity. As you know, our tune and my tune specifically has changed a bit on that over the last couple of years. And I think we're positioned to really continue to get some significant, both economic and strategic benefits by advancing our investment in that. And so we're hard at work on that. Nothing specific to report here but I think you'll hear from us in the near future on that.\nOperator: Our next caller is Aryeh Klein with BMO Capital Markets.\nAryeh Klein: Maybe just on the AI front. Clearly, the momentum is accelerating. Curious how you think about the TAM there, particularly relative to the $21 billion outlined at the Analyst Day. And then maybe just on the NVIDIA DGX offering, how meaningful can that become? And is that something you can ultimately offer anywhere and beyond the $12 billion [ph] or so markets initially targeted?\nCharles Meyers: Yes. I mean, AI is a really interesting one. I think there is a massive opportunity. I think similar to what other people are seeing, we see it as hugely promising and moving very quickly but still pretty darn early in the overall cycle. So it's -- it clearly was a major factor in our xScale leasing. Obviously, record bookings there and I expect we're going to continue to see a lot of strength and that's informing a bit of that desire to lean in on that investment. I wouldn't say it's yet proving to inflect our retail bookings. As I just said, we kind of -- we were a little shorter than we wanted to be there. But again, we're seeing the green shoots there, we saw some great early on the retail side, both last quarter in terms of these network nodes to support large-scale training requirements with some of the service fares we talked about those. And then some really good enterprise wins as they're looking at really enterprise-level training as well as inference and how to really unlock the full power of the AI ecosystem. And so -- and we think the NVIDIA DGX private cloud managed service is a really distinctive offering. And we're seeing big pipeline build there with NVIDIA on that front. And so -- so I do think we have a very broad range of where I think we can offer that around the world and we'll continue to expand that over time. But again, I think a hugely exciting opportunity. In terms of -- you asked about the TAM, I mean as I said at the Analyst Day, I think the TAM is huge. And so I think it's probably bigger than what we've set out there. I think when you look at the possible impacts and kind of what we're seeing in terms of the early returns on AI, I think you're going to continue to see a lot of investment flow to that. And so I think the TAM is probably bigger than what we outlined. I think the key for us is really where can we be distinctively differentiated in that. Yes, I think we're going to get a piece on the xScale side. But I think the more differentiated position for us over the long term is unlocking the power of the AI ecosystem through this sort of cloud adjacent set of offerings. And on the digital services side, our cloud adjacent storage and Fabric Cloud Router all sort of hitting in that sweet spot of what we think customers are really looking for -- control over their enterprise data ability to access AI tools from the hyperscalers who are innovating rapidly in that area, stitch it all together and make it work in a way that makes sense for them. And so Fabric Cloud Router, fabric, cloud-adjacent storage, all things that really play into that. So we continue to be very optimistic about that. But I would say tempering expectations, I think it's going to -- it's going to take a little time for that to really fully realize itself in terms of the bookings flow.\nOperator: Our next caller is John Atkin with RBC.\nJonathan Atkin: On the churn commentary, is there anything to call out in terms of reading where you saw it or which products? Was it mainly cabinets or cross connects or other?\nCharles Meyers: Yes. I would say more on cabinets and power. The cross-connect turn is looking a lot like it has for the last several quarters, John. Growth activity continues to be strong. I think we're seeing some grooming, particularly in the network service provider segment as their businesses are a bit more challenged and I think they're really focused on cost reduction. We are seeing some consolidation into higher speeds. So that's a bit of a bit of a headwind. But I think the more, the more, the elevation was a bit more on the cabinets and power and CapEx side. But it really is related primarily, I think, to people resizing footprints in a way that is -- aligns to what their more immediate need is because I think that it's, we have -- I think there was a time there when people were saying, \"Hey, I have more than I need but I'm just going to hang on to it.\" And I think we -- that was the case in '22. But in '23, we've seen people a lot more pressured by budget. Part of that, we think, is actually related to -- you, guys, asked us a lot of questions when we did the PPI around would that create elasticity. And we haven't seen what I would consider traditional elasticity of demand but what we have sort of heard coming from our sales teams is a pressure that says, \"Hey, I ate up all my budget with the PPI. And so I can't grow as I expected. And so if I want to do some of the things, I'm looking to do on the AI front, I got to find room.\" And so they've been more typically contracting footprints. And so that's really the dynamic we're seeing. Let me give you a little more color on a couple of areas. One, only a single-digit percentage of our churn is full customer churn. So almost all -- the rest of it is all people moving around resizing footprints, that kind of activity. And quite encouragingly, I said, well, let's look at those customers and those that are churning and tell me what their other -- what their activity level is across the rest of the platform. And quite encouraging for the most part, you're finding those customers are buying elsewhere in tandem with the optimization work that they're doing. And so I think that's really the dynamic there. In terms of, I would say we've seen a little more of that in Europe, John. And that's probably because we were -- had a little large footprint population there. So I think we're seeing it a little heavier there. But again, our guide says sort of assumes that we're going to continue to see some of this through the first half of this year with attenuation of that in the back half of '24.\nJonathan Atkin: Got it. And then secondly, I was curious about the xScale initiative and the growth path in the Americas and kind of the puts and takes of pursuing that organically versus inorganically?\nCharles Meyers: Yes. I mean I think we're very focused right now on organic. We would certainly not be -- we wouldn't necessarily not be open to inorganic. I just think it's a tougher thing in terms of identifying those assets. I think the multiples at which those things are trading are pretty heady, to say the least and plenty of competition for those assets. And so I think we're primarily focused on organic. And -- but again, if the circumstances and conditions change, one, our balance sheet is always ready. And I think we'd be open to that. But I think our focus is probably more so on the organic side.\nOperator: And our next call is Michael Rollins with Citi.\nMichael Rollins: Just first following up on the point that you're making about customer optimization. I think in the past, you've used the analogy of managing the retail data centers is like a tetra sport [ph] of sitting different pieces and deployments together. As there's some optimization, can you share your opportunity to resell any space or power capacity that you get back and how that plays into the dynamic for 2024? And then just secondly, just curious if you could unpack the constant currency organic growth range, xPower [ph] of 7% to 8% in terms of what stabilized growth would be -- and then within stabilized, how to think about the price ARPU component relative to the volume component.\nCharles Meyers: Okay. Maybe Keith can jump in here on the second part of that, too and we'll tag team it a bit. But let me catch your first one first. Yes, you're absolutely right. We've long for many years, talked about our business as a bit of a tetris game [ph] in terms of figuring out how to get optimal returns from our capacity. And I would tell you that I think that given the increasing price environment, given the tendency for our churn to be a bit biased towards the large footprint side of things, we generally see churn as value accretive over time. That doesn't mean we want it all. It's -- but it's -- sometimes, we need it and we actually may sort of work to get it to happen. And that's, as I said, that happens sometimes in Singapore in the markets like that. But there is inherently a trade-off between growth rates and return on invested capital. And what we're seeing is that even in high-demand markets, there is a vacancy drag. And what I mean by that is the time frame that it takes to really fully replace churn with new revenue and that's particularly true when you're replacing a single large foot implementation with a large number of smaller deals, we're seeing probably a little longer vacancy drag than what we maybe would have thought. And so while I think that the -- that kind of positive mark-to-market opportunity exists and improving our business mix has always been central to our ability to deliver increasing MRR per cab and return on investment sort of stabilized asset performance and importantly, FFO per share, it is sometimes a revenue headwind for us. So we do see that on the churn but I think there are positive aspects to it as well. As to the 7% to 8%, look, if you look at stabilized assets, absent the PPI, they're in that 5% range. And -- and so -- but that includes selling interconnection into them. It's probably not a ton of additional volume growth. They're operating at reasonably high levels of utilization. So I do think you're going to see some positive price on mark-to-market. And I think you're going to see continued interconnection sort of probably more, in our more traditional range. And then the rest of that, that growth is going to have come from the broader footprint, including our non-stabilized assets which are probably growing at a slightly higher rate. Anything to add further on that?\nKeith Taylor: Yes. And Michael, let me just add maybe just a few other quick points. We've always said that we think stabilized assets can grow 3% to 5% on a sort of constant currency and normalized basis. And this quarter, we're at that range 9% with the power price increases. What are you going to feel -- what you're seeing this year being 2024, there's a couple of things. So we've neutralized currency, we've neutralized for all intents and purposes, the power price decreases. Again, that's going to have a roughly 30 basis point impact, I mean the power price, it will impact sort of the growth rate a little bit there. And so where we're really focusing is really the timing. Okay to somebody [ph], so what we're really focusing on is the timing. And so as Charles alluded to, had a little bit higher churn as we entered the -- exited the year. We have a little bit more higher churn at the front end of the year. And so when you look to the back end of the year, you actually get a much more attractive growth rate than what you start the year at. And so what it blends itself out, basically, you've got a 7% to 8% growth rate. But overall, when you sort of the business in and of itself, extremely strong pipeline. We're taking into consideration what we think is the timing delays in -- and although a reasonable book-to-bill interval, we still think that the just how -- the speed at which things are converting from the pipeline into a billable event, that's just taking longer. And then the other thing, I would just say is nonrecurring revenues for all intents and purposes, it's going to be roughly flat year-over-year. It's going to move around quarter-to-quarter, as we've talked about. Q4 was very rich, Q1 is still pretty darn good because we closed 2 large assets in xScale space in January. And so we will get -- there be some fees that. But I think what's most important is understanding that the richness of the pipeline, the timing of the year and what we envision that we'll exit 2024 with, is what gives us the confidence that we can continue to drive the value into the main FFO per share number and give you the growth.\nCharles Meyers: Well, Mike, I'd say that the short story on it is that 7% to 8%, I think, is 3% to 5% is the way to think about the stabilized assets. And the balance of that is going to really need to come from the broader portfolio which is probably going to have less mark-to-market juice. I think the 3% to 5% has to come in part from some juice in the mark-to-market opportunity that we have in the stabilized assets. Because those are the ones that are going to be rolling through. You probably have a little less than that in the non-stabilized portfolio because they are newer -- in newer contracts with probably less of a gap there. And then we're just going to have to continue to drive the volume on the gross bookings side.\nOperator: Our next caller is David Barden with Bank of America.\nDavid Barden: Two, if I could, just real quick. Charles, we've been talking about the hybrid private public cloud infrastructure for the longest time. You brought up a new term that I hadn't heard before, the private AI. And I wondered if you could maybe elaborate a little bit how that compares, contrasts or doesn't to our understanding of hybrid private public cloud. What is that, the private AI architecture look like as far as Equinix concerned? And then second, Keith. Last quarter, we talked a lot about cabinet, 8 cab [ph] per cab, consumption and how that's evolving and the potential to bring a new number to the forefront which would be something like a cabinet equivalent billing number. Could you kind of elaborate a little bit on how that looked like in the fourth quarter and where we are in evolving that disclosure.\nCharles Meyers: Thanks, David. So on private AI, I do think there's strong similarities and some differences between what we think about private cloud or hybrid cloud. But I think the dynamic is quite similar. And in fact, I was looking at an industry survey that was recently given to me that showed that based on their discussion with respondents that we're implementing Gen AI, about 32% of those funds were doing that in public clouds, exclusively. About 32% we're doing it in private cloud exclusively. And about -- and now 36%, we're doing it in a hybrid between some private cloud, some public cloud. And the folks who are doing it in public, many of them were doing it in more than 1 public cloud. And so that dynamic in sort of how we saw cloud large play out over the last several years. And I think the end state is going to be that, that 36% is going to be a much bigger number. In other words, a much larger number of people are going to be doing sort of prosecuting their AI agenda through both public and private infrastructure. But I would say when we talk about where private AI happens, a lot of it is really focused on where people want to place their data. And this desire to -- and it is sometimes about the proprietary nature of that data and controlling it, etcetera and it sometimes about the cost of moving data in and out of public clouds. And other factors, including performance. And so private AI, what we're seeing is people saying, look, I want to maintain my control over my enterprise data. And I want to place it somewhere that is cloud adjacent because the hyperscalers are innovating at such a rapid rate that I want to use their models, their tools, their -- and then you have this broader ecosystem outside of just the hyperscalers that is also evolving that people want to connect to. And so cloud adjacent storage Equinix Fabric and Fabric Cloud Router are incredible tools and then you mix that with the color [ph] opportunity that they might need to place GPU infrastructure and that kind of thing, that's really what we see as the essence of the private AI opportunity. And so -- and it does, I think, seem to be taking shape in a way that's really positive for us. And then, go ahead on the second piece on the -- I know that we had that question before, David, we figured that one might be coming.\nKeith Taylor: Yes, David. So as it relates to some new metrics, we're continuing to review the data sets. The team, we're not clear that exactly what needs to be presented that we can comfortably put out of the market on a consistent basis. But one of the things we're thinking about, just to give you a sense and we're not ready for prime time yet, is looking at density or a threshold and the extent that there's a certain amount of density over some required threshold, we modify the cabinets again, as you all know, we report on a cabinet equivalent basis. So that's what we're thinking about because we think the cabinet is probably the best representation for you to get a sense of how we're utilizing the asset. That all said, we still -- I think we have to continue to be quite transparent about the overall density of the cabinets sold so that you can see sort of a trend line. We spent some energy thinking about power prices, just doesn't feel like the right metric to be sure. And given the nature of our business model relative to others. Again, as you know, we're a retail player and it just -- it's just a different type of metric and we're not sure that, that is a valuable metric. So looking forward, we're going to continue to work it and we'll absolutely be actually -- be sort of ready to go, I think, sometime in the first half of this year with either adjusted metrics or a different view on how we're going to represent our fill rates.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Elias with TD Cowen.\nMichael Elias: Great. Two, if I may. One of the questions we get from investors is whether GPU-based compute is distance remediating CPU-based compute. And if so, how the legacy data centers designed at lower cabinet densities, we'll be able to handle that. Are you seeing customers swapping CPUs for GPUs for their existing data center deployments. If so, how do you mitigate essentially against the obsolescence in existing facilities? That's the first question. And then the second question is along a similar vein for AI inference. The thought is about the model we need to sit proximate to the data which candidly lives within your facilities. Although I think there's also a question of whether that's CPU-based or GPU-based. As you look to capture demand for inference, how is the standard data center design for you, guys, evolving from both a power density perspective and a cooling architecture standpoint? Any color there would be helpful.\nCharles Meyers: There's lots there. All of things -- thanks for the question, Michael. All things that are obviously top of discussion around FX in various places. I do think that, look, GPUs are sort of something that is much more special purpose, dedicated compute that is -- that goes beyond the traditional CPU realm. I mean, I think is a very, very clear trend. That said, I don't think that it's a world where all things compute and all things AI are necessarily done by GPUs. And I think that there is going to be a range of players that I think continue to evolve on the compute side of things to provide chips that meet various sets, of various purposes in the AI realm. And so in terms of the AI and I don't -- we aren't seeing is this massive shift out or from CPU to GPU. What we're typically seeing is people adopting GPUs in parallel. And I think that even some things that are currently GPU-centric, we think over time, may actually be well served by either current or future generations of CPU. And so we're not seeing that as a big obsolescence trend. And that relates a little bit to the second part of your question and I think both on inference and training because I would say that the evolution of the data center design needs to respond to both of those things. I would say the more acute near-term evolution is on the training side. Because it's substantially more power dense and does require, I think, different thinking around that power density and the cooling to support it. And so I think the much higher average density design that we would probably put forward xScale build-out would be that more acute representation of the near-term change. On the inference side and I think broadly on the retail side, we are seeing densities, power densities rise but at a slower rate. And I think that our ability to implement liquid cooling as long as we have access to a chilled water loop, our ability to get liquid cooling into the facility to support high-density implementations is quite high. And in fact, we announced that we can do that in a large number of markets around the world. So I think we're in a good position. I don't think we face a situation where we're going to have meaningful obsolescence even of our significantly more dated assets. And so especially as we can implement liquid cooling inside of those facilities. And so -- but I think we're -- those are things we continue to track and I do think they're going to have to be very top of mind for us. And probably the overall pace of change in our design is going to increase in this next decade than it was in the one prior for sure. piles.\nOperator: The next caller is Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt Niknam: I will keep it brief, it's 2 follow-ups. Number one, what guides your expectation for churn to, I guess, improve slightly in the second half? Is there anything you have -- you're seeing in terms of visibility or anything guiding that expectation for improvement? And then secondly, in terms of its macro, you talked about some, I guess, deal slippage and dynamics that resemble maybe 1Q of '23 that you saw in 4Q. Just any updates in terms of -- we're now, I guess, halfway into 1Q. Have those deals closed? Are they still out there? Just any color, I guess, from what you see in the first 6 weeks of this year.\nCharles Meyers: Yes. Let me take that one first, Matt. We have -- some of that business has close to -- some of that closed very quickly immediately after the quarter and that's just sort of a natural turn of events. Some of it is in our commit for Q1 and some of it has rolled into Q2 or quarters forward from that. So very little lost. We did -- we had lost some of that but very little of it. And so really primarily push forward. Again, as I said, Q4 did unfortunately look a little more like Q1. We would have referred it to look a lot more like Q2 and Q3. But that is the dynamic. And I think that we're -- it's hard to fully predict. But again, our customers, the sentiment we hear from customers is one, yes, we have tighter budgets. Yes, we're continuing to optimize. But boy, we sure are committed to what we're doing on the digital side of things. And yes, we want to talk to you about what we're doing in AI. And yes, we want to figure out where to place our data. But I think those things take a little time to translate into firm bookings trajectory. And then as to why we feel a comfort level around mitigation churn, we do have good visibility to our pipeline. In fact, our large deal churn, we've gotten very good at forecasting. We saw a little bit more midsized churn in Q4 which contributed some to the elevation. And so I think we have to keep our eye very closely on that. And I don't have a ton more to offer you on that particular view. But I think that we do think that it is realistic for us based on what we're hearing in terms of appetite from customers that we would see some abatement and churn in the second half. I'll add one more comment. It used to be, I would say, '21 and most of '22, I think there was a scarcity mindset relative to data center capacity. '23 really changed pretty meaningfully. The macro conditions changed. This sort of desire to tighten budgets, the desire to kind of offset the impact of PPI. I think all did play into what we were hearing was this very different appetite and a higher degree of optimization. I would say, I think we're seeing the front end, though, of some of our customers who have at least talked to us about turning back some capacity, sort of come back and say, yes, don't put that back on the market yet because we're not sure we want to give up capacity in this market. And so that's the first time, I think, in a while that we've heard that kind of mindset. It's typically from larger service providers. But I think we're going to probably see -- we're starting to see the front end of that. And so again, if macro does what we think it will do which we would probably see some improving interest rates over the course of the year. I think we would see a generally improved macro environment and I think that's sort of informing our guidance.\nOperator: Our next caller is Richard Choe with JPMorgan.\nRichard Choe: I wanted to follow up on the competitive environment. Are you seeing deals go to competitors or...\nCharles Meyers: Yes. I mean, we certainly see some -- it's not like we don't see any competitive loss. But our or -- and I would say it's more typically on some of the larger footprint stuff. I think there are certain use cases that were just -- so competitively distinguished that we have less that there's -- it's less likely that we'll see those it's oftentimes more a timing issue. I do think that where we're tight, customers sometimes have to find another way, right? And so we hate that but it happens. But I wouldn't say overall -- there's certainly certain markets where we have solid people with a solid value proposition that I think can compete effectively in certain markets. And I do think we're starting to see also just people thinking about how they want to allocate their workloads. And so the overall share of wallet continues to be more of the question in terms of how people are thinking about their spend going forward.\nRichard Choe: And then in terms of pricing actions for the year, what's kind of implied in guidance? And should we expect that there are some price increases for interconnection this year?\nCharles Meyers: Yes. I mean, I think overall, we're seeing a really robust pricing environment, right? And so -- and probably many of the -- we put forward through a number of price increases. I do think we're evaluating a price increase on interconnection in the U.S. market. I think -- but overall, I think that's certainly one contributing factor to our ability to continue to drive growth in the business. And I think that firm pricing is also has really, I think, informing the really critical overall message here which is a degree of confidence and a really attractive guide on the improving profitability of our business and the AFFO per share guidance which is, in fact, at the sort of more towards the top end of our Analyst Day guide. And so -- and again, as we've said, that's really our lighthouse metric. We think it's the bedrock of value creation when you combine that with our dividend yield and overall creates a really attractive story.\nOperator: And our next caller is Frank Louthan with Raymond James.\nFrank Louthan: Great. And just maybe to follow up on that, Charles. With some of this optimization with customers, any thought about customers possibly looking for some products you have to just cross connect or others trying to find that from others for less as they're trying to optimize their budgets? Is there any concern there?\nCharles Meyers: Yes, we don't see that as typical as there -- in a lot of markets, I think that our position is so -- it's not that we're the only game in town. And so yes, there is some substitution in cases but it really is more us seeing that people saying, hey, things that they weren't using, things that they can consolidate on the higher-speed circuits, those kind of things are really the broader dynamics. Also, I would tell you that I think we're seeing that the positivity or the positive benefits of being able to have the full range of services available for our customers is really there. And so they may say, \"Hey, your -- we think your metal offering really meets our immediate need here. It's our agile as [ph] is more flexible.\" We may eventually move that into colocation over time or sometimes the opposite. And so -- so I think that the momentum, both in the data center services and I think increasingly on the digital services side, even though I think we've got a lot of work to do continue to evolve our go-to-market motion and our underlying cash systems and processes, etcetera, to really support the slightly different business that an as a service model provides in digital services but I think we're continue to make good progress there. And I think our full portfolio of offerings is resonating well with the customer.\nChip Newcom: This concludes our fourth quarter earnings call. Thank you for joining us today.\nOperator: Goodbye. And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time and have a great rest of your day.",

            "name": "Keith Taylor",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Charles and good afternoon to everyone. As highlighted by Charles, we had a solid end to 2023. The Equinix team continued to execute across all levels of the organization to ensure our strategy as the world's digital infrastructure company continue to separate us from our peers. For the full year, our healthy gross bookings allowed the team to close almost 17,000 deals across more than 5,900 customers. Highlighting the diversity and strength of our unrivaled go-to-market engine. Then pricing activity, both in the quarter and throughout the year, created strong pricing dine resulting in normalized and constant currency MRR per cap yield stepping up $38 for the quarter and $127 for the year to $2,227 per cap [ph]. And we had record exceled leasing over the year while generating approximately $49 of nonrecurring xScale fee revenue in the quarter, primarily related to the EMEA region. On the sustainability front, we're pleased to again be listed on CDP's prestigious 2023 Climate Change A-List and again, to be recognized in JUST Capital's 2024 rankings as number one in real estate. As we look forward into 2024, our customers remain committed to all things digital and we believe we're the best manifestation of this opportunity as customers digitally transform their form, both in the cloud and through AI. Hence our enthusiasm about our position in the broader market and the opportunities that lay out for us. That said, we remain highly vigilant to the current market conditions and the impact on our customers. As mentioned last quarter, capacity constraints exist across a few of our markets, driving continued firm pricing power, albeit with some moderation to short-term growth. But as highlighted, on our expansion tracking slide, we have several new markets and additional capacity coming online later this year, with many other projects currently being contemplated as we look to extend our platform and drive growth. Also, we're very pleased with the operating leverage the business is delivering, benefiting from prior investments while being highly present future spend, resulting in improving adjusted EBITDA margins for the year. Importantly, our forward guide on our core metric being AFFO per share reflects our confidence in the long-term opportunity of our business, a preferential position, I believe, relative to any others in our space given the foundational differences of our platform. Additionally, our as reported guidance includes positive FX tailwinds due to the weaker U.S. dollar relative to '23 rates and net power price decreases as utility rates moderate across both our regulated and unregulated markets. Now let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Do note that all comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q4 revenues were $2.11 billion, up 15% over the same quarter last year due to strong recurring revenue growth, power price increases and record xScale nonrecurring fees. As you would expect, we're very pleased with the continued success of our xScale portfolio and the MRR and other fees generated, while also expecting a strong year in 2024. As noted previously, xScale MRR is inherently lumpy. For Q1, we expect MRR will step down sequentially, yet remain elevated as a turn of revenues due to strong APAC leasing activity in January. Q4 revenues or FX hedges includes a $3 million benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $920 million, or 44% of revenues, up 12% over the same quarter last year due to strong operating performance, although down quarter-over-quarter due to a $15 million charge related to our planned corporate real estate activities and a higher seasonal increase in repairs and maintenance spend. Q4 adjusted EBITDA net of our FX hedges had a minimal FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates and does include $4 million of integration costs. Global Q4 AFFO was $691 million, above our expectations due to strong business performance and favorable interest income, offset in part by higher seasonal recurring CapEx. The Q4 included a $4 million FX headwind compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q4 MRR terms stepped up to 2.4% in the higher end of our range due to customer optimizations. For 2024, we expect MRR churn to stay in the upper side of our churn range in the first half of the year, then moderate down in the second half and we expect this key metric average within our targeted 2% to 2.5% per quarter range for the year. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized and constant currency basis, EMEA was our fastest-growing MRR region at 27% due to power price increases. Followed by our APAC and Americas regions at 9% and 7% MRR growth, respectively. The Americas region had a solid quarter of strong new logo growth and firm pricing led by our Chicago, New York and Washington, D.C. metros. The Americas saw a step-up in cabinets billing in the quarter which now includes the intel assets in our nonfinancial metrics. EMEA business had a strong quarter led by our German business and our growth in urging market metros. We've had strong xScale activity across a number of our markets over the year. MainOne, our business in Ghana, Ivory Coast in Nigeria is performing better than our business case on a constant currency basis. Additionally, we signed our first deal in our Johannesburg 1 asset in South Africa which opens in Q3. And finally, the Asia Pacific region saw good performance in both our Japanese markets and in Mumbai. As it relates to our soon-to-be opened new markets in the region, we're actively building a strong pipeline of key ecosystem customers which we expect to close prior to the IBX openings. Also, we're pleased to have recently announced our first long-term PPA in APAC for 151 megawatts. To date, Equinix has executed 21 PPAs across Australia, France, Iberia, the Nordics and the U.S. which will generate more than 1 gigawatt of clean energy once operational. This will certainly help these markets accelerate their clean energy transition. And now looking at our capital structure. Please refer to Slide 8. Our net leverage remains low relative to our peers at 3.7x our annualized adjusted EBITDA. Our balance sheet increased approximately $32.1 billion [ph], including an unrestricted cash balance of $2.1 billion. Our cash balance includes the settlement of approximately $433 million of ATM food equity sales, the timing triggered by the increase in our Q4 quarterly cash dividend. Additionally, during the quarter, we executed an incremental $500 million of ATM forward equity sales which we expect to settle in late 2024. As I've noted previously, we expect to remain opportunistic in the timing and currency of our financing strategy, including our plans to refinance the $1 billion of debt maturing this year. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were $996 million, including recurring CapEx of $105 million. Since our last earnings call, we opened 7 retail projects, including 4 new data centers in Frankfurt, Kuala Lumpur, also Washington, D.C. In our xScale program, we opened 7 new projects and are now 87% leased or pre-leased for all of our operational and the Nose projects [ph]. During the quarter, we also purchased our London IBX asset and land for development in Mexico City. Revenue from owned assets increased to 66% of our recurring revenues, a meaningful step up in last quarter, highlighting the progress we've had around asset ownership and long-term control of our assets. Our capital expenditures delivered strong returns, as shown on Slide 10. Our 174 stabilized assets increased revenues by 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis or 5% excluding the benefit attributed to our power price increases. Our stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. As a reminder, unlike prior years, we plan to update our stabilized asset summary on the Q1 earnings call. And finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for an updated summary of 2024 guidance and bridges. Starting with revenues. For the full year 2024, we expect top line growth of 7% to 9% on an as-reported basis or 7% to 8% on a normalized and constant currency basis, excluding the impact of lower power cost pass through to our customers. We expect 2024 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 47%. And a 160 basis point improvement over last year due to strong operating leverage, targeted expense management initiative and power price decreases. We expect to incur $25 million of integration costs, primarily related to the main 1 business, projects which we expect to complete by end of year. AFFO is expected to grow between 9% and 12% compared to previous year. AFFO per share is expected to grow between 8% and 10% at the top end of our longer-term targeted range on both an as reported and normalized and constant currency basis. 2024 CapEx is expected to range between $2.8 billion and $3 billion, including about $220 million of recurring CapEx. And finally, after moving forward with the 25% increase in our per share cash dividend last quarter, we're holding our quarterly cash dividend cost at $4.26 per share for 2024. For the full year, the cash dividend will approximate $1.6 billion, a year-over-year increase of 19%, 100% which is expected towards from ordinary income given our expected strong operating performance. So, let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles. Yes. And Michael, let me just add maybe just a few other quick points. We've always said that we think stabilized assets can grow 3% to 5% on a sort of constant currency and normalized basis. And this quarter, we're at that range 9% with the power price increases. What are you going to feel -- what you're seeing this year being 2024, there's a couple of things. So we've neutralized currency, we've neutralized for all intents and purposes, the power price decreases. Again, that's going to have a roughly 30 basis point impact, I mean the power price, it will impact sort of the growth rate a little bit there. And so where we're really focusing is really the timing. Okay to somebody [ph], so what we're really focusing on is the timing. And so as Charles alluded to, had a little bit higher churn as we entered the -- exited the year. We have a little bit more higher churn at the front end of the year. And so when you look to the back end of the year, you actually get a much more attractive growth rate than what you start the year at. And so what it blends itself out, basically, you've got a 7% to 8% growth rate. But overall, when you sort of the business in and of itself, extremely strong pipeline. We're taking into consideration what we think is the timing delays in -- and although a reasonable book-to-bill interval, we still think that the just how -- the speed at which things are converting from the pipeline into a billable event, that's just taking longer. And then the other thing, I would just say is nonrecurring revenues for all intents and purposes, it's going to be roughly flat year-over-year. It's going to move around quarter-to-quarter, as we've talked about. Q4 was very rich, Q1 is still pretty darn good because we closed 2 large assets in xScale space in January. And so we will get -- there be some fees that. But I think what's most important is understanding that the richness of the pipeline, the timing of the year and what we envision that we'll exit 2024 with, is what gives us the confidence that we can continue to drive the value into the main FFO per share number and give you the growth. Yes, David. So as it relates to some new metrics, we're continuing to review the data sets. The team, we're not clear that exactly what needs to be presented that we can comfortably put out of the market on a consistent basis. But one of the things we're thinking about, just to give you a sense and we're not ready for prime time yet, is looking at density or a threshold and the extent that there's a certain amount of density over some required threshold, we modify the cabinets again, as you all know, we report on a cabinet equivalent basis. So that's what we're thinking about because we think the cabinet is probably the best representation for you to get a sense of how we're utilizing the asset. That all said, we still -- I think we have to continue to be quite transparent about the overall density of the cabinets sold so that you can see sort of a trend line. We spent some energy thinking about power prices, just doesn't feel like the right metric to be sure. And given the nature of our business model relative to others. Again, as you know, we're a retail player and it just -- it's just a different type of metric and we're not sure that, that is a valuable metric. So looking forward, we're going to continue to work it and we'll absolutely be actually -- be sort of ready to go, I think, sometime in the first half of this year with either adjusted metrics or a different view on how we're going to represent our fill rates."

            "name": "Charles Meyers",
            "content": "Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. We had a solid close to 2023 as digital transformation and accelerating AI demand drove a record quarter for xScale leasing, robust pricing dynamics and continued momentum across our data center and digital services portfolios. For the full year, we delivered more than $8 billion of revenues, eclipsing 21 years of consecutive quarterly growth, all while driving AFFO per share performance above the top end of our long-term expectations. As we look ahead, we see our overall relevance to customers continue to rise with our global reach, highly differentiated ecosystems and full-range portfolio of services, positioning us as a key long-term partner to fuel digital transformation and unlock the enormous potential of AI. At the same time, many customers remain cautious in the face of macro uncertainty and are driving optimization across their broader IT infrastructure. Freeing up dollars for AI-related investments while still managing within tighter overall budgets. These dynamics, combined with capacity constrained in certain key markets continue to create cross currents in our business with solid gross demand and strong pricing dynamics being offset by more deliberate buying decisions and slightly higher levels of churn. Meanwhile, we continue to realize the benefits of efficiency investments over the past few years and are showing strong operating leverage in the business, allowing us to maintain our differentiated return on invested capital, expand margins and deliver outsized performance on AFFO per share which we continue to see as our lighthouse metric and the bedrock of long-term value creation. As work to make digital infrastructure more powerful, accessible and sustainable, we are building relationships as trusted advisers to our customers, innovating across our product portfolio, deepening our technology partnerships to solve customer challenges and maintaining our discipline to put the right customers with the right workloads into the right assets. This approach reinforces the kind of advantages of Platform Equinix as we focus our efforts in 2024 on 4 key areas: First, we plan to continue to expand our unmatched global reach, extending the 76 metros in 35 countries by year-end, including opening new markets in India, Indonesia, Malaysia and South Africa. We also intend to add much needed capacity in high-demand existing markets across all 3 regions, including significant retail phases in New York, Paris and Tokyo and accelerated investment in our xScale portfolio. Second, we intend to extend our interconnection leadership by combining the scalability and performance of physical interconnection and the agility of Equinix Fabric with a commitment to lead the way in the massive market of multi-cloud networking, with new innovations and products like our recently announced Equinix Fabric Cloud Router. Third, we'll continue to prioritize our future first sustainability strategy, making Equinix a clear partner of choice to help our customers track and see their sustainability goals and manage an increasingly complex global power landscape. And finally, we intend to unlock the power of platform clinics, embracing key partners and making it easier than ever to combine our value with theirs. So we can solve our customers' problems together. In particular, we focus on Gen AI as we join forces with incredible partners such as NVIDIA, to ensure that Platform Equinix is the place where private AI happens. Turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for the full year were $8.2 billion, up $925 million, a 15% increase year-over-year or a 9% increase, excluding the impact of power price increases. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.7 billion, up 11% year-over-year. AFFO was more than $3 billion for the first time, resulting in AFFO per share growth of 11% year-over-year. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. On the AI front, we saw strong momentum across the value chain in Q4 as we cultivated key partnerships and one significant opportunities. While still early, Gen AI has the capacity to transform every industry and is poised to accelerate rapidly. By 2026, Gartner predicts over 80% of enterprises have used Gen AI APIs and models or deployed Gen AI-enabled applications in production environments, up from just 5% in early 2023. We're leaning into this opportunity and recently announced our expanded partnership for IBX private cloud at Equinix. This new service provides customers a fast and cost-effective way to adopt advanced AI infrastructure that's operated and managed by experts globally. So enterprises can move quickly, while balancing performance requirements, a need for cloud adjacency and a rapidly increasing desire to maintain control of critical enterprise data. We're seeing strong interest in this service across all 3 regions with early adoption from digital leaders in biopharma, financial services, software, automotive and retail subsegments. Early wins in this partnership include a Fortune 100 global biopharma company who will create an AI of excellence to accelerate its research and development process and shorten time to market for new medications. Our data center services portfolio continues to scale with 9 new data center openings since our last earnings call. Given the strong underlying demand for digital infrastructure and the long duration in delivering new capacity, we continue to invest broadly across our global footprint. We currently have 49 major projects underway in 35 markets across 21 countries including 11 xScale builds representing nearly 20,000 cabinets of retail and more than 50 megawatts of xScale capacity through 2024. Wins this quarter included a European biotechnology company, exiting their traditional data centers in favor of a global network dense, hybrid and multi-cloud environment, including liquid cooling requirements. Andorin Holding [ph], a Turkish conglomerate, mainly serving as a strong global automotive supply company, expanding with Equinix to support their operations across 15 countries. Shifting to our xScale initiative, the wave of hyperscale demand to support AI and cloud is translating into robust demand in pre-leasing activity. Since our last earnings call, we leased 90 megawatts of capacity across 6 assets in EMEA and APAC, including approximately 32 megawatts leased at the start of the year. This brings total xScale leasing to 300 megaport [ph] globally. Wins this quarter included supporting strategic Gen AI workloads as well as the hyperscalers first-scale liquid cooling deployment at Equinix. Looking ahead, we have a meaningful pipeline of opportunities to drive continued xScale momentum in the quarters to come. Turning to our industry-leading global interconnection franchise, we now have more than 462,000 total interconnections deployed on our platform. In Q4, interconnection revenue stepped up 8% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis and we added an incremental 4,300 organic interconnections for the quarter. We, again, had healthy gross adds activity, offset somewhat by continued grooming and consolidations into higher bandwidth connections. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 22% year-over-year, to nearly 36 terabits per second, led by expansion from existing customers. Additionally, during the quarter, we added 4 new native cloud on-ramps in Bogota, Calgary and Zurich. Equinix customers can now enjoy low latency access to multiple native cloud on-ramps in 37 metros, including 8 out of the 10 world's largest metros by GDP. Wins this quarter included a leading European quantum computing company, offering its technology through Equinix Metal and Equinix Fabric, enabling different industries to explore potential use cases in quantum computing. And on insurance, a South African insurance company expanding in EMEA, leveraging Equinix Fabric and a managed service solution to be ready to begin trading. In our digital services portfolio, we saw continued momentum as Equinix Metal and Network Edge drove attractive pull-through to Equinix Fabric. In January, we announced the general availability of Equinix Fabric Cloud Router, a new virtual routing service to simplify enterprises complex cloud-to-cloud and hybrid cloud networking challenges by providing an easy-to-configure enterprise-grade multi-cloud routing service that can be deployed in under a minute. Customers can deploy Equinix Fabric Cloud Router in all 58 Equinix fabric-enabled metros globally, with low latency connectivity to all the major cloud providers as well as hundreds of other service providers. Key digital wins included NetApp, who expanded their partnership with Equinix to deliver a Bare Metal service solution, a comprehensive compute, network and storage infrastructure stack with low latency connections to major public clouds. And a leading semiconductor company, establishing a cloud adjacent storage presence using Equinix Metal and Pure Storage with integration into AWS. Our channel program delivered another good quarter, accounting for 35% of bookings and over 50% of new logos. We saw continued growth from partners like HPE, HCL, NVIDIA and WWT, with wins across a wide range of industry verticals and digital first use cases. Wins this quarter included supporting a consumer health care company's business unit spin-off with Dell, setting up a hybrid IT environment by leveraging colocation and cloud for their SAP environment in London and Singapore. Now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Thanks, Keith. In closing, 2023 was a year of significant progress and focused execution against our ambitious agenda. While macro uncertainties persist, we anticipate continued economic recovery as we move through 2024 and believe this will continue to embolden customers to accelerate their digital transformation agendas with a keen focus on capturing business value through the extraordinary power of AI. Against this backdrop, demand for hybrid digital infrastructure should continue to grow and we're confident that the character of this demand will increasingly align with the distinctive advantages of Equinix, offering customer flexibility to deploy architectures that are more distributed, more cloud connected, more on-demand and more ecosystem rich than ever before. Features that have positioned Equinix once again as a leader in IDC MarketScape's worldwide assessment of data center services. Digital transformation is reshaping the fabric of our world, unlocking extraordinary possibilities and changing the basis for competition in almost every industry. Thanks to our distinct and durable advantages, Equinix is well positioned to capture these opportunities. Through the combined balance sheet power of Equinix and our JV partners, we'll continue to invest in supporting the vigorous demand for large-scale cloud and AI infrastructure around the world. Simultaneously, we will leverage the reach and connectivity of the world's leading retail platform to ensure that Equinix remains the best manifestation of the digital edge and a critical point of Nexus [ph] for modern cloud-centric architectures. Reaffirming our purpose to be the platform where the world comes together, enabling the innovations that enrich our work, our life and our planet. So, let me stop there and open it up for questions. Sure. Thanks for the question. Yes. Look, I would say overall demand signal, I think, remains strong. But as a reference it, we continue to see what we're characterizing these crosscurrents in the business. And we've seen -- seen those great bearing levels of revenue headwind over the past few quarters, really from 3 sources, I'd say. The first 2 really related to macro, as you mentioned and the last one, a bit more Equinix specific. First, I think a bit of extension in the sales cycle. In Q4, a bit similar to what we saw in Q1 of '23 we saw more deal slippage which we really had not seen in Q2 and Q3. And so we thought that we were served in a better spot. But not a lot of lost deals but a number of deals that got pushed one or more quarters and that affected the quarter and the exit rate. Second, we saw churn as slightly elevated. And I think more towards the high end of our range which really reflects the continuation of the optimization activity that we -- and candidly, others across the infrastructure space have been highlighting throughout 2023. And then the last one I'd say is really more -- a little more specific to us. I think we continue to grapple with capacity constraints in some of our key markets. And that hits us on the gross fitting [ph] since we really can't accommodate larger footprint requirements in those markets and it hits us on the churn side, in some cases, as we work to try to free up capacity through doing some churn and though we've seen that certainly in markets like Cisco or so [ph]. All those factors combined to give us a little lighter Q4 and therefore a little bit lower exit run rate. And as you know, in a 95% recurring revenue business that kind of puts you behind the power curve. So our full revenue guide come in a little bit below our Analyst Day range. But again, as you saw, a lot of things, I think, to be -- to feel good about, given the xScale strength, I think we saw strong bookings performance in our retail sweet spot. A very healthy pipeline and starting to see signs of emergence of an even bigger AI-related pipeline. So we continue to be upbeat about the long-term opportunity. And importantly, I think despite the lower revenue guide, I think we're continuing to see robust pricing, really driving some operating leverage in the business when that continues to really translate to those attractive returns on capital. A growing dividend and AFFO per share performance that really is at the top end of our long-term guidance range. So I think that's the overall thing. And again, I think really, we'd love to be in that range, believe me. And it's disappointing that we're not. But I think we're giving you a realistic view of what we think the current market content will support and we're going to go like hell to try to beat that. So that's that. Relative to U.S. xScale [ph], yes, we are absolutely working on how we're going to continue to be more aggressive in this market. We think there is opportunity. As you know, our tune and my tune specifically has changed a bit on that over the last couple of years. And I think we're positioned to really continue to get some significant, both economic and strategic benefits by advancing our investment in that. And so we're hard at work on that. Nothing specific to report here but I think you'll hear from us in the near future on that. Yes. I mean, AI is a really interesting one. I think there is a massive opportunity. I think similar to what other people are seeing, we see it as hugely promising and moving very quickly but still pretty darn early in the overall cycle. So it's -- it clearly was a major factor in our xScale leasing. Obviously, record bookings there and I expect we're going to continue to see a lot of strength and that's informing a bit of that desire to lean in on that investment. I wouldn't say it's yet proving to inflect our retail bookings. As I just said, we kind of -- we were a little shorter than we wanted to be there. But again, we're seeing the green shoots there, we saw some great early on the retail side, both last quarter in terms of these network nodes to support large-scale training requirements with some of the service fares we talked about those. And then some really good enterprise wins as they're looking at really enterprise-level training as well as inference and how to really unlock the full power of the AI ecosystem. And so -- and we think the NVIDIA DGX private cloud managed service is a really distinctive offering. And we're seeing big pipeline build there with NVIDIA on that front. And so -- so I do think we have a very broad range of where I think we can offer that around the world and we'll continue to expand that over time. But again, I think a hugely exciting opportunity. In terms of -- you asked about the TAM, I mean as I said at the Analyst Day, I think the TAM is huge. And so I think it's probably bigger than what we've set out there. I think when you look at the possible impacts and kind of what we're seeing in terms of the early returns on AI, I think you're going to continue to see a lot of investment flow to that. And so I think the TAM is probably bigger than what we outlined. I think the key for us is really where can we be distinctively differentiated in that. Yes, I think we're going to get a piece on the xScale side. But I think the more differentiated position for us over the long term is unlocking the power of the AI ecosystem through this sort of cloud adjacent set of offerings. And on the digital services side, our cloud adjacent storage and Fabric Cloud Router all sort of hitting in that sweet spot of what we think customers are really looking for -- control over their enterprise data ability to access AI tools from the hyperscalers who are innovating rapidly in that area, stitch it all together and make it work in a way that makes sense for them. And so Fabric Cloud Router, fabric, cloud-adjacent storage, all things that really play into that. So we continue to be very optimistic about that. But I would say tempering expectations, I think it's going to -- it's going to take a little time for that to really fully realize itself in terms of the bookings flow. Yes. I would say more on cabinets and power. The cross-connect turn is looking a lot like it has for the last several quarters, John. Growth activity continues to be strong. I think we're seeing some grooming, particularly in the network service provider segment as their businesses are a bit more challenged and I think they're really focused on cost reduction. We are seeing some consolidation into higher speeds. So that's a bit of a bit of a headwind. But I think the more, the more, the elevation was a bit more on the cabinets and power and CapEx side. But it really is related primarily, I think, to people resizing footprints in a way that is -- aligns to what their more immediate need is because I think that it's, we have -- I think there was a time there when people were saying, \"Hey, I have more than I need but I'm just going to hang on to it.\" And I think we -- that was the case in '22. But in '23, we've seen people a lot more pressured by budget. Part of that, we think, is actually related to -- you, guys, asked us a lot of questions when we did the PPI around would that create elasticity. And we haven't seen what I would consider traditional elasticity of demand but what we have sort of heard coming from our sales teams is a pressure that says, \"Hey, I ate up all my budget with the PPI. And so I can't grow as I expected. And so if I want to do some of the things, I'm looking to do on the AI front, I got to find room.\" And so they've been more typically contracting footprints. And so that's really the dynamic we're seeing. Let me give you a little more color on a couple of areas. One, only a single-digit percentage of our churn is full customer churn. So almost all -- the rest of it is all people moving around resizing footprints, that kind of activity. And quite encouragingly, I said, well, let's look at those customers and those that are churning and tell me what their other -- what their activity level is across the rest of the platform. And quite encouraging for the most part, you're finding those customers are buying elsewhere in tandem with the optimization work that they're doing. And so I think that's really the dynamic there. In terms of, I would say we've seen a little more of that in Europe, John. And that's probably because we were -- had a little large footprint population there. So I think we're seeing it a little heavier there. But again, our guide says sort of assumes that we're going to continue to see some of this through the first half of this year with attenuation of that in the back half of '24. Yes. I mean I think we're very focused right now on organic. We would certainly not be -- we wouldn't necessarily not be open to inorganic. I just think it's a tougher thing in terms of identifying those assets. I think the multiples at which those things are trading are pretty heady, to say the least and plenty of competition for those assets. And so I think we're primarily focused on organic. And -- but again, if the circumstances and conditions change, one, our balance sheet is always ready. And I think we'd be open to that. But I think our focus is probably more so on the organic side. Okay. Maybe Keith can jump in here on the second part of that, too and we'll tag team it a bit. But let me catch your first one first. Yes, you're absolutely right. We've long for many years, talked about our business as a bit of a tetris game [ph] in terms of figuring out how to get optimal returns from our capacity. And I would tell you that I think that given the increasing price environment, given the tendency for our churn to be a bit biased towards the large footprint side of things, we generally see churn as value accretive over time. That doesn't mean we want it all. It's -- but it's -- sometimes, we need it and we actually may sort of work to get it to happen. And that's, as I said, that happens sometimes in Singapore in the markets like that. But there is inherently a trade-off between growth rates and return on invested capital. And what we're seeing is that even in high-demand markets, there is a vacancy drag. And what I mean by that is the time frame that it takes to really fully replace churn with new revenue and that's particularly true when you're replacing a single large foot implementation with a large number of smaller deals, we're seeing probably a little longer vacancy drag than what we maybe would have thought. And so while I think that the -- that kind of positive mark-to-market opportunity exists and improving our business mix has always been central to our ability to deliver increasing MRR per cab and return on investment sort of stabilized asset performance and importantly, FFO per share, it is sometimes a revenue headwind for us. So we do see that on the churn but I think there are positive aspects to it as well. As to the 7% to 8%, look, if you look at stabilized assets, absent the PPI, they're in that 5% range. And -- and so -- but that includes selling interconnection into them. It's probably not a ton of additional volume growth. They're operating at reasonably high levels of utilization. So I do think you're going to see some positive price on mark-to-market. And I think you're going to see continued interconnection sort of probably more, in our more traditional range. And then the rest of that, that growth is going to have come from the broader footprint, including our non-stabilized assets which are probably growing at a slightly higher rate. Anything to add further on that? Well, Mike, I'd say that the short story on it is that 7% to 8%, I think, is 3% to 5% is the way to think about the stabilized assets. And the balance of that is going to really need to come from the broader portfolio which is probably going to have less mark-to-market juice. I think the 3% to 5% has to come in part from some juice in the mark-to-market opportunity that we have in the stabilized assets. Because those are the ones that are going to be rolling through. You probably have a little less than that in the non-stabilized portfolio because they are newer -- in newer contracts with probably less of a gap there. And then we're just going to have to continue to drive the volume on the gross bookings side. Thanks, David. So on private AI, I do think there's strong similarities and some differences between what we think about private cloud or hybrid cloud. But I think the dynamic is quite similar. And in fact, I was looking at an industry survey that was recently given to me that showed that based on their discussion with respondents that we're implementing Gen AI, about 32% of those funds were doing that in public clouds, exclusively. About 32% we're doing it in private cloud exclusively. And about -- and now 36%, we're doing it in a hybrid between some private cloud, some public cloud. And the folks who are doing it in public, many of them were doing it in more than 1 public cloud. And so that dynamic in sort of how we saw cloud large play out over the last several years. And I think the end state is going to be that, that 36% is going to be a much bigger number. In other words, a much larger number of people are going to be doing sort of prosecuting their AI agenda through both public and private infrastructure. But I would say when we talk about where private AI happens, a lot of it is really focused on where people want to place their data. And this desire to -- and it is sometimes about the proprietary nature of that data and controlling it, etcetera and it sometimes about the cost of moving data in and out of public clouds. And other factors, including performance. And so private AI, what we're seeing is people saying, look, I want to maintain my control over my enterprise data. And I want to place it somewhere that is cloud adjacent because the hyperscalers are innovating at such a rapid rate that I want to use their models, their tools, their -- and then you have this broader ecosystem outside of just the hyperscalers that is also evolving that people want to connect to. And so cloud adjacent storage Equinix Fabric and Fabric Cloud Router are incredible tools and then you mix that with the color [ph] opportunity that they might need to place GPU infrastructure and that kind of thing, that's really what we see as the essence of the private AI opportunity. And so -- and it does, I think, seem to be taking shape in a way that's really positive for us. And then, go ahead on the second piece on the -- I know that we had that question before, David, we figured that one might be coming. There's lots there. All of things -- thanks for the question, Michael. All things that are obviously top of discussion around FX in various places. I do think that, look, GPUs are sort of something that is much more special purpose, dedicated compute that is -- that goes beyond the traditional CPU realm. I mean, I think is a very, very clear trend. That said, I don't think that it's a world where all things compute and all things AI are necessarily done by GPUs. And I think that there is going to be a range of players that I think continue to evolve on the compute side of things to provide chips that meet various sets, of various purposes in the AI realm. And so in terms of the AI and I don't -- we aren't seeing is this massive shift out or from CPU to GPU. What we're typically seeing is people adopting GPUs in parallel. And I think that even some things that are currently GPU-centric, we think over time, may actually be well served by either current or future generations of CPU. And so we're not seeing that as a big obsolescence trend. And that relates a little bit to the second part of your question and I think both on inference and training because I would say that the evolution of the data center design needs to respond to both of those things. I would say the more acute near-term evolution is on the training side. Because it's substantially more power dense and does require, I think, different thinking around that power density and the cooling to support it. And so I think the much higher average density design that we would probably put forward xScale build-out would be that more acute representation of the near-term change. On the inference side and I think broadly on the retail side, we are seeing densities, power densities rise but at a slower rate. And I think that our ability to implement liquid cooling as long as we have access to a chilled water loop, our ability to get liquid cooling into the facility to support high-density implementations is quite high. And in fact, we announced that we can do that in a large number of markets around the world. So I think we're in a good position. I don't think we face a situation where we're going to have meaningful obsolescence even of our significantly more dated assets. And so especially as we can implement liquid cooling inside of those facilities. And so -- but I think we're -- those are things we continue to track and I do think they're going to have to be very top of mind for us. And probably the overall pace of change in our design is going to increase in this next decade than it was in the one prior for sure. piles. Yes. Let me take that one first, Matt. We have -- some of that business has close to -- some of that closed very quickly immediately after the quarter and that's just sort of a natural turn of events. Some of it is in our commit for Q1 and some of it has rolled into Q2 or quarters forward from that. So very little lost. We did -- we had lost some of that but very little of it. And so really primarily push forward. Again, as I said, Q4 did unfortunately look a little more like Q1. We would have referred it to look a lot more like Q2 and Q3. But that is the dynamic. And I think that we're -- it's hard to fully predict. But again, our customers, the sentiment we hear from customers is one, yes, we have tighter budgets. Yes, we're continuing to optimize. But boy, we sure are committed to what we're doing on the digital side of things. And yes, we want to talk to you about what we're doing in AI. And yes, we want to figure out where to place our data. But I think those things take a little time to translate into firm bookings trajectory. And then as to why we feel a comfort level around mitigation churn, we do have good visibility to our pipeline. In fact, our large deal churn, we've gotten very good at forecasting. We saw a little bit more midsized churn in Q4 which contributed some to the elevation. And so I think we have to keep our eye very closely on that. And I don't have a ton more to offer you on that particular view. But I think that we do think that it is realistic for us based on what we're hearing in terms of appetite from customers that we would see some abatement and churn in the second half. I'll add one more comment. It used to be, I would say, '21 and most of '22, I think there was a scarcity mindset relative to data center capacity. '23 really changed pretty meaningfully. The macro conditions changed. This sort of desire to tighten budgets, the desire to kind of offset the impact of PPI. I think all did play into what we were hearing was this very different appetite and a higher degree of optimization. I would say, I think we're seeing the front end, though, of some of our customers who have at least talked to us about turning back some capacity, sort of come back and say, yes, don't put that back on the market yet because we're not sure we want to give up capacity in this market. And so that's the first time, I think, in a while that we've heard that kind of mindset. It's typically from larger service providers. But I think we're going to probably see -- we're starting to see the front end of that. And so again, if macro does what we think it will do which we would probably see some improving interest rates over the course of the year. I think we would see a generally improved macro environment and I think that's sort of informing our guidance. Yes. I mean, we certainly see some -- it's not like we don't see any competitive loss. But our or -- and I would say it's more typically on some of the larger footprint stuff. I think there are certain use cases that were just -- so competitively distinguished that we have less that there's -- it's less likely that we'll see those it's oftentimes more a timing issue. I do think that where we're tight, customers sometimes have to find another way, right? And so we hate that but it happens. But I wouldn't say overall -- there's certainly certain markets where we have solid people with a solid value proposition that I think can compete effectively in certain markets. And I do think we're starting to see also just people thinking about how they want to allocate their workloads. And so the overall share of wallet continues to be more of the question in terms of how people are thinking about their spend going forward. Yes. I mean, I think overall, we're seeing a really robust pricing environment, right? And so -- and probably many of the -- we put forward through a number of price increases. I do think we're evaluating a price increase on interconnection in the U.S. market. I think -- but overall, I think that's certainly one contributing factor to our ability to continue to drive growth in the business. And I think that firm pricing is also has really, I think, informing the really critical overall message here which is a degree of confidence and a really attractive guide on the improving profitability of our business and the AFFO per share guidance which is, in fact, at the sort of more towards the top end of our Analyst Day guide. And so -- and again, as we've said, that's really our lighthouse metric. We think it's the bedrock of value creation when you combine that with our dividend yield and overall creates a really attractive story. Yes, we don't see that as typical as there -- in a lot of markets, I think that our position is so -- it's not that we're the only game in town. And so yes, there is some substitution in cases but it really is more us seeing that people saying, hey, things that they weren't using, things that they can consolidate on the higher-speed circuits, those kind of things are really the broader dynamics. Also, I would tell you that I think we're seeing that the positivity or the positive benefits of being able to have the full range of services available for our customers is really there. And so they may say, \"Hey, your -- we think your metal offering really meets our immediate need here. It's our agile as [ph] is more flexible.\" We may eventually move that into colocation over time or sometimes the opposite. And so -- so I think that the momentum, both in the data center services and I think increasingly on the digital services side, even though I think we've got a lot of work to do continue to evolve our go-to-market motion and our underlying cash systems and processes, etcetera, to really support the slightly different business that an as a service model provides in digital services but I think we're continue to make good progress there. And I think our full portfolio of offerings is resonating well with the customer."

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thank you, Chip. Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Despite an increasingly complex macro environment, we delivered another solid quarter of results and continue to drive strong value creation, raising both our dividend and our AFFO per share outlook for the full year. While we continue to operate in an environment characterized by customer caution, this caution is balanced by a clear commitment to digital transformation and accelerating interest in AI and a growing reliance on Equinix as a critical partner in designing and implementing hybrid, multi-cloud, and data-centric architectures. Customers continue to see digital as a critical priority, and they remain focused on optimizing existing infrastructure spend and capabilities across cloud, network and other categories. Demand remains strong. New logo growth is accelerating, and we see a highly favorable pricing environment, allowing us to deliver higher MRR per cabinet yields driven by price, power density, and strong interconnection demand. The net result is solid revenue growth, a strong forward pipeline and continued optimism about our differentiated ability to deliver compelling value to our customers and in turn, to our shareholders. In Q3, our go-to-market engine continued to execute well with more than 4,200 deals in the quarter across more than 3,100 customers, including record new logos from high-value targeted customers. We saw solid performance across all aspects of our platform strategy with data center services, digital services, and our xScale, all coming together to address the evolving demands of our customers and strong cross-regional bookings highlighting the power of our unmatched global reach. On the AI front, we continue to cultivate and win significant opportunities across our existing customer base and with AI-specific prospects. A recent Gartner poll found 55% of organizations are in pilot or production mode with generative AI. We are seeing this manifest in accelerated interest from both enterprise customers and from emerging service providers looking to service this demand. We see strong similarities between the evolving AI demand and the multi-tiered architectures that have characterized the cloud build-out for the past eight years. And believe that our broad portfolio of offerings in tandem with our key technology partners will allow us to capture high-value opportunities across the AI value chain along three key vectors. First, in our retail business, we will aggressively pursue magnetic AI service provider deployments to support on-ramps, inference nodes and smaller scale training needs. We are well-positioned here with nearly 40% market share of the on-ramps to the major cloud service providers, key players in the AI ecosystem. And in Q3, we're proud to have been recognized at a 2023 Google Cloud Customer Awards winner for our work supporting Google AI technology. Key wins in this area for Q3 included Core Wheat, a specialized GPU cloud provider, deploying networking nodes at Equinix leveraging our unique multi-cloud on-ramps and network connectivity across multiple metros. And Lambda, selecting Platform Equinix to offer customers expanded regional connectivity, higher networking performance, security and scale for an enterprise-grade GPU cloud, dedicated to large language models and generative AI workloads. Second, we intend to meaningfully augment our xScale portfolio, including in North America to pursue strategic large-scale AI training deployments with the top hyperscalers and other key AI ecosystem players, including the potential to serve highly targeted enterprise demand. We expect some builds will be tightly coupled with our retail campuses like our newly announced Silicon Valley 12x asset, while other builds will be larger-scale campuses in locations with access to significant power capacity. And finally, in response to burgeoning enterprise AI demand, we will leverage our unique advantages to position Platform Equinix as the place where private AI happens, allowing customers to place compute resources in proximity to data and seamlessly leverage public cloud capabilities, all while maintaining control of high-value proprietary data. We also anticipate a dramatic acceleration in inference workloads and see Equinix as well-positioned to deliver performance and economic benefits derived from our reach, network density and cloud adjacency. While still early, we're seeing broad-based demand for private AI from digital leaders with specific wins in the transportation, education, public sector and healthcare verticals, including Harrison.ai, a clinician-led healthcare artificial intelligence company that is dedicated to addressing the inequality and capacity limitations in our health care system, by developing AI-powered tools in radiology and pathology. An exciting opportunity that not only drives our business, but clearly aligns with Equinix values. As AI demand accelerates, we are adapting our product portfolio and our physical platform in response to evolving customer requirements. In terms of data center design, we're using our co-innovation facility in Ashburn to evaluate technologies to support escalating power requirements and have already commercialized our early work in this area with liquid cooling solutions that are supportable in all markets, including support for direct-to-chip liquid cooling in 45 markets across all three regions. We are already supporting significant liquid cool deployments across our range of deployment sizes and densities and we look forward to sharing more with you on our progress in this space. Turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q3 were $2.06 billion, up 14% year-over-year driven by strong recurring revenue growth and power price increases. Adjusted EBITDA was up 9% year-over-year, and AFFO per share was better than our expectations due to strong operating performance and timing of recurring CapEx spend. Interconnection revenues grew 9% year-over-year with continued strength from Equinix Fabric. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our data center services portfolio continues to perform well. Given the strong underlying demand for digital infrastructure and the long duration in delivering new capacity, a factor that continues to drive positive pricing trends, we're investing broadly across our global footprint. We currently have 56 major projects underway in 39 markets across 23 countries, including 14 xScale builds that will deliver more than 100 megawatts of capacity once opened. More than 50% of our expansion capital is supporting capacity in our major metros where we have strong visibility to fill rates. Recurring revenues from customers deployed in more than one region stepped up 1% quarter-over-quarter to 77% as customers continue to move to more distributed architectures. On interconnection, we now have over 460,000 total interconnections with 4,200 net interconnections added in Q3 thanks to healthy gross adds, offset somewhat by continued grooming activity and consolidations into higher bandwidth connections. Equinix Fabric saw continued momentum with record port orders and significant growth in provision bandwidth, up 8% quarter-over-quarter to more than 200 terabits per second. Internet Exchange had another strong quarter in APAC with peak traffic in the region, surpassing the Americas for the first time. Globally, peak traffic was up 9% quarter-over-quarter and 27% year-over-year to nearly 35 terabits per second. Recent interconnection and ecosystem wins include Southern Cross, expanding their relationship with Equinix by deploying their SX NEXT subsea cable into our LA4 IBX to boost aggregate capacity on their US to Australia and New Zealand network by 50%. And the Warsaw Stock Exchange, migrating their primary matching engine and trading system to Equinix' Warsaw 3 IBX to offer more capabilities and enhanced trading performance. We continue to invest behind our platform strategy with revenue growth from our digital services portfolio significantly over-indexing relative to the broader business, including strong adoption of our network edge offering by enterprise customers. We're also seeing momentum in expanding our partnerships with leading technology companies, including the recent announcement of NetApp storage on Equinix Metal, which is an integrated full stack solution that provides enterprise customers low latency access to all clouds while keeping control of their data, a critical consideration for AI workloads. Key digital services wins this quarter included McGraw Hill, a leading educational publishing company, deploying virtual hubs using Network Edge across multiple markets to connect to key cloud providers via Equinix Fabric. And a significant win with a global gaming company using Equinix Metal to support a major new product launch. Our channel program delivered another strong quarter, amplifying the reach of our sales team and accounting for over 65% of new logos with wins across a wide range of industry segments focusing on digital transformation initiatives. We continue to see growth from partners like AT&T, Cisco, Dell, and HPE. Key wins included a top five US public school district seeking to modernize aging IT infrastructure while improving systems uptime and enhancing cybersecurity. This win executed with partners, Dell Technology Managed Services, Carasoft, and ImpEx Technologies, will deliver low latency, multi-cloud connectivity and secure network access to key ecosystem resources while lowering operational expenses. Now, let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results from the quarter.\nKeith Taylor: Great. Thanks Charles and good afternoon to everyone. Let me start by saying I hope you and your families are doing well. Now, notwithstanding these complex and difficult times, we continue to remain bullish about our business and the opportunities ahead as we work hard to expand our strategic and preferential position in the marketplace. As you all know, one of the core tenets of our strategy revolves around long-term shareholder value creation. With that in mind, we continue to build capacity in markets that will enhance our platform positioning and differentiate our offerings into the future. Also, we continue to work diligently to maintain rigor with our pricing strategies while closely overseeing our spending decisions. As it relates to our capital structure, we've been able to maintain a highly advantaged balance sheet with ample liquidity and lower leverage. This gives us the flexibility to opportunistically access the capital markets under terms and conditions that are beneficial to us. In addition, we're actively working to support other strategic operating goals, including how and where we source our supply chain, including energy costs, while increasing our investments in and around our future first sustainability initiatives, both highly important matters for our customers. Lastly, we remain pleased with our efforts to manage our derivative risks, including our exposure to foreign currencies and interest rates. Moving on to the business, we continue to perform well. In Q3, we had solid gross and net bookings with strong customer demand. Our pricing dynamics are very positive. MRR churn is well within our targeted range. Also, given the tight supply environment across many of our metros, we and our customers continue to look for ways to optimize deployment, including increasing the power density of the cabinets sold. This drives improved bottom line profitability and higher return on invested capital. Global MRR per cabinet was up $57 quarter-over-quarter to $2,214 per cabinet, a 12% increase on our yield year-on-year on a constant currency basis. With respect to our net cabinets billing metric, it remains flat compared to Q2, largely due to the meaningful increase in density of cabinet and the timing of bookings and churn at the end of the quarter. We have a solid backlog of booked but not yet installed cabinets and the depth of our pipeline and the related coverage ratios support an expected strong bookings performance to close out our year. Now, let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Know that all comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q3 revenues were $2.061 billion, up 14% over the same quarter last year due to strong recurring revenue growth and power price increases. Non-recurring revenues remained flat compared to the prior quarter. Although it was not before non-recurring revenues, particularly those attributable to our xScale business are inherently lumpy, for Q4, our guide implies a meaningful step-up on non-recurring revenues attributed to a number of deals expected to close across different markets this quarter. Q3 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $1 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $936 million or 45% of revenues, up 9% over the same quarter last year due to strong operating performance. Looking forward, our Q4 adjusted EBITDA is expected to remain roughly flat due to the timing of our spend and specific one-time costs attributed to corporate real estate activities. Q3 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, includes a $1 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and $2 million of integration costs. Global Q3 AFFO was $772 million, above our expectations due to strong business performance and timing of recurring CapEx spend. Q3 AFFO included minimal FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 MR turned step down to 2.2%, and we expect Q4 MR churn to remain consistent with our Q3 levels in the lower half of our 2% to 2.5% quarterly guidance range. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized and constant currency basis, EMEA and APAC were our fastest-growing regions at 26% and 10%, respectively, followed by our Americas region at 7% year-over-year growth. The Americas region had a solid quarter across many of our key metros, and we experienced strong public sector activity. As it relates to AI, sales activity discussed in Charles' remarks, the vast majority of the demand is destined for Americas footprint. And as highlighted by Charles, this quarter, we won a mix of AI training, inference and networking deployments with the pipeline of anticipated deals to follow. Our EMEA business had a strong quarter led by our UK and Dutch markets and record digital services bookings. In EMEA, as highlighted previously, we continue to lean into our future-first sustainability strategy, including implementing heat export initiatives into Frankfurt, Helsinki, and Paris communities while supporting other innovative environmental initiatives to support many other communities and where we operate. And finally, the Asia-Pacific region saw a solid performance led by our Hong Kong, India, and Singapore markets. Capacity constraints exist across a number of our markets, particularly Singapore. These supply constraints will help drive strong deal discipline and pricing power in these markets. During 2024, we'll be opening new markets in India, Indonesia, and Malaysia, expanding our APAC platform and ecosystems in pursuit of larger opportunities given the demand for digital infrastructure. And now looking at our capital structure. Please refer to Slide 8. Our net leverage remains low relative to our peers at 3.5 times our annualized adjusted EBITDA. Our balance sheet increased slightly to approximately $31.7 billion including an unrestricted cash balance of over $2.3 billion. Our cash balance remained flat quarter-over-quarter as our strong operating cash flow and financing activity was offset by our investment in growth CapEx and the quarterly cash dividend. As I've previously noted, we've been opportunistically looking to raise additional debt capital in reduced rate environments. To that end, in September, we raised $337 million of Swiss Franc denominated five-year paper at an attractive 2.875% rate. Additionally, during the quarter, we executed an incremental $230 million of ATM forward equity sales, which we expect to settle alongside our Q2 ATM forward contract in late 2023. These financing transactions will help fund our 2024 growth initiatives, alongside other sources of capital while allowing us to maintain our strategic flexibility. Also in September, we published our 2023 green bond allocation report. As highlighted in the report, we have now fully allocated the net proceeds from our green bonds aligning our financing efforts with our commitment to create a more environmentally friendly data center footprint. Turning to Slide 9, for the quarter, capital expenditures were $618 million, including recurring CapEx of $52 million. Since our last earnings call, we opened six new retail projects, including two new data centers in Dubai and Montreal. We also purchased our Dublin 1 and Montreal 1 IBX assets and land for development in Manchester in Washington, D.C. Revenue from owned assets were 64% of recurring revenues for the quarter. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our 174 stabilized assets increased revenues by 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Our stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and generated a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for our updated summary of 2023 guidance and bridges. Do note, all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. For the full year 2023, we're maintaining our underlying revenue outlook with expected top line growth of 14% to 15% or approximately 9% growth, excluding the impact of power costs passed through to our customers, a reflection of our continued strong execution. We are raising our underlying 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $17 million due to favorable operating costs and lower integration spend and we're raising our underlying AFFO guidance by $27 million to now grow between 12% and 14% compared to the previous year. AFFO per share is now expected to grow between 10% and 11%. CapEx is expected to remain in the $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion range, including approximately $215 million of on-balance sheet xScale spend, which we expect to be reimbursed for when these assets are transferred to JVs early next year and about $225 million of recurring CapEx spend, an increase over the prior quarter as we accelerate costs into Q4. Lastly, given our strong operating performance and our historically low AFFO payout ratio, we've accelerated the timing of our cash dividend increase into Q4 of this year from Q1 of next year. As a result, the quarterly cash dividend will increase by 25% to $4.26 per share this quarter. Looking forward, we expect our annual cash dividend growth rate will track at or above our AFFO per share growth rate for a number of years. So, let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thanks Keith. In closing, we continue to see strong demand as customers embrace AI and advance their digital transformation agendas with infrastructure that is more distributed, more cloud connected and more ecosystem enabled than ever before. Despite a variety of cross currents in the business, we are translating healthy bookings growth, a favorable pricing environment, and increasing power densities into strong increases in cabinet yield. These dynamics, combined with the continued focus on driving operating leverage and expense discipline through the business, are allowing us to deliver compelling value on a per share basis. As we close out 2023 and look towards 2024, our forward-looking strategy and vision for our platform will enable us to amplify our unique strengths, leveraging them to expand our market opportunity, and drive sustainable growth in a rapidly evolving landscape. We remain optimistic about the road ahead and steadfast in our commitment to show up every day in service too, starting with the resolve to align, inspire, and empower our teams around our strategy and our mission, enabling them to deliver durable value and meaningful impact to our customers, our shareholders and the communities in which we operate. So, let me stop there and open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.\nMatt Niknam: Hey guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Just two if I could. First, on the cabs billing metric. I appreciate you, Charles, given some of that color around the increased power density. I'm just wondering if there's any additional color you can share with some of the softness in the cabs billing adds, some of the actions you may be taking to release some of that available capacity at higher mark-to-market rates and any sort of color you can share in terms of expectations for 4Q. And then second question, again, we appreciate all the color on AI. Just wondering if you can give us any more color on the conversations you're having with customers on their AI strategy, what role Equinix can play in helping them meet their goals and any sort of timing in terms of when this can become a little bit more material? Thanks.\nCharles Meyers: Yes, you bet, Matt. Yes, we absolutely figured that we would have a question there on the cabs, as you might imagine, key topic in the discussion. I want to start by just reinforcing that the flat cabinet growth is really not driven by a lack of demand, as you heard in the script. We had another really solid bookings quarter with overall deal counts in line with what we've been seeing. And so I think it's not a demand problem, per se. As I said last quarter, look, we recognize billing cab adds have to be part of the growth story over time, but the pressure on the metric is really linked to some other positive dynamics in the business as you sort of alluded to there. So, let me unpack that a little bit for you and give you a little more detail. I think the force that I think maybe we didn't fully appreciate the past couple of quarters or didn't highlight as much as the extent and the pace of the evolution on the power density. And so we really dug into that this quarter and looked at that for the last several quarters. And what we found is really an expanding delta between the power density of our churn cabinets and that of our newly sold cabinet. So, we look back over these first three quarters of 2023, where we've had a flatter profile on the build cabs or billing cabs, and we've turned cabinets over that period an average density of 4 kilowatts per cab, but we've added new billable cabs at an average of 5.7. So, that's really a major factor that our cab equivalent metric is not density adjusted. So, the reality is we've been paddling hard against that increase in density when it comes to cabinet growth. Additionally, and we talked about this in prior calls as well, we do have some capacity constraints, somewhat -- ones in certain markets. And those are driving some proactive churn on our part, and we see a level of customer optimization at the cabinet level similar to what we've been talking about on interconnection, but we're seeing very little customer churn or full customer churn. And so I'm not -- I'm definitely not saying that all of our churn activity is necessarily desirable or wanted. But as you can see in our churn metric, we're managing the overall churn really well within our guided range. So, as I said -- I talked about last quarter, these 37 deployments with really positive mark-to-market when you look at both price and power density and when we look at Q3, we actually saw that general range of 60% to 70% uplift as broadly applicable. So, in other words, our average of our churn cabinets or new cabinets were about 60% to 70% above what we had churned. And so obviously, that dynamic is super attractive in terms of in really explaining why we're driving healthy revenue growth even with the limited growth in billable cabs. So, I mean, we've always said we're not ones to chase volume as a business objective, because I think that often results in a loss of discipline in the process. We're very much playing the long game when it comes to our commercial decision-making. And although cabinet growth is going to have to be a part of the story over time, we're really seeing that the current dynamics are allowing us to drive, as we said, strong MRR per cab, solid stabilized asset growth and really, I think, the return on capital is going to continue to be very favorable. So, I think all of that translates into what we see as the really most critical bottom line, and that's AFFO per share and dividend growth. And I think sort of the results are really strong in that area. So, that's context on the first question and on billable cabs. Second one on AI, definitely seeing it show up. We talked about in the script about a number of deals that we won in the quarter. AI and ML are not new things for us. We kind of talked about that. We've been working, I think, through AI opportunities with digital leaders for several years now. There's a lot happening across the platform. In fact, people don't maybe remember it, but we announced our NVIDIA Launchpad offering with them over two years ago. And really, that's been a unique opportunity for us to get in early with customers as they're piloting AI initiatives in their business and really monitor AI demand in the marketplace. And so we've closed a number of deals with service providers this quarter. There's definitely an emergent set of service providers, Core Wheat and Lambda we talked about that I think are really sources of incremental demand for us. We closed those deals really in the retail footprint focused on networking and inference-type nodes. And I think that what we're seeing most of with customers is working with them on three big questions when they're thinking about AI. Where do I put my data? And I think we're seeing a lot of people looking at sort of cloud adjacent data as the answer. And I think that plays right to our advantages. Secondly, how they bring compute and other data sources in other words, data that's not their own to their own data. And then finally, how do they deliver AI generated business insights to the users of those insights economically and with high performance. And so those really are the areas that we've been deeply engaged with our customers. I think that it's a contributing factor to our probably our best forward-looking pipeline, multi-quarter pipeline that we've seen in a long time. And so I do think AI is a very positive force in the business overall.\nMatt Niknam:\nOperator: Our next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. You m ay go ahead.\nFrank Louthan: Great. Thank you. Just a quick question on -- so on the channel, you mentioned 65% of new logos coming from the channel. What percentage of overall sales are there? And then how do the logos in the channel tend to perform longer term versus those from the existing sales force, they produce the same amount of repeat business?\nCharles Meyers: Yes, I would -- I think our bookings percentage is probably in the 40%-ish range from our channel. You do have to recognize, Frank, and we've been very transparent about this. Our channel is not really a sell-through channel as much. It's really more of a sell with sort of meeting the market. But what we're using is the extensive relationships that our channel partners have, particularly in the broad enterprise to identify and then bring our unique value to the table. And so that often results in essentially a joint selling proposition between ourselves and our partners. And over time, I would say that I think we need to be moving towards a bit more of a sell-through model that would provide even more economic leverage to the model. But we do see our channel wins as very on par in terms of quality of business and our ability to sell into them. Sometimes even more readily -- we can capture incremental wallet share even more readily because of the strength of our channel partners from a relationship perspective inside of those accounts. And so I'd say very much a positive force for us. And as we look at now sort of deepening our channel relationship with key technology partners, we talked about the NetApp offering with NetApp Storage on Metal. Those are great examples. We do have a similar sort of offering with Pure. And so those things are really relevant as customers are saying, hey, we're really deeply thinking about where to place our data, we have technology opinion about the storage providers we'd like to use, and we really would like to that at Equinix to get proximity and adjacency to the cloud. And so I think those -- that's a great example for the kind of deals that we're winning in the channel, and that continues to be an important part of the business.\nFrank Louthan: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead.\nJon Atkin: Thanks. So, I was interested in if there's anything notable to call out that drove the growth in EMEA where things seem to have accelerated a bit versus APAC, which saw a slightly slower growth. And then on pricing, which I think you mentioned in the earlier part of your prepared remarks, where do you see the main levers? Would it be renewal spreads on cabinets or harmonizing cross connects or anything to kind of call out around pricing to think about in 2024? Thanks.\nCharles Meyers: Sure. Yes, I mean I think when you adjust for the PPI, I mean, because the EMEA numbers are obviously done on an as-reported basis are driven significantly by PPI. And so there is that we certainly are seeing, I think, good performance across our regions. APAC, I think, is over a multi-quarter period here, a little -- has more constraints to deal with. And so from a capacity perspective, and as we've talked about Singapore being sort of a prominent example there. But I would also say that in EMEA, I think a more prominent feature for us to continue to be looking at internally. And I realize that there's not as deep a transparency or granularity in the information ability, but the deal mix in EMEA continues to be extremely favorable. And the team has done a really great job going from, what I think, was a little more dependency on some of the large footprint business over time and now in a post xScale world, really shunting the really large stuff off xScale and I think weaning away from a dependency on large footprint demand even in the enterprise I think always has the sort of the prospect of greater churn probability over time. And so the deal mix in EMEA has really shaped nicely, I think, over the last couple of years, and I think really kudos to the team on the ground there to make that happen. Then on pricing, I would just say that I think pricing broadly speaking, is very favorable. Part of that is just simply driven by, I think, an understanding from customers that increases in underlying costs are driving a rising price environment across a whole range of things and so that's one factor. But then I think that perhaps the more important one for us is, I think, being able to deliver really compelling value for them and being able to articulate that effectively to them. And so in terms of the -- where it's coming from, yes, I do think there's continued pricing activity on all -- across our portfolio, interconnection, space and power, and on our digital services. And then I think that the -- and that includes both uplifts on list pricing, and as well as on renewals. And so I think you're really seeing that show up in terms of -- as I just -- I tell you, when you look at a dynamic that says okay, if you're churning cabinets at X and you're selling new cabinets at 1.6 or 1.65x, that's a very attractive dynamic. It's not driven entirely by price because power density is a meaningful part of that. And then actually, new cabs mature even further as interconnection goes into those over time. And so I think those are some of the dynamics on the pricing front. And I think it's has been a little hard for people to hold all that in their head and figure out exactly why that you have some of these dynamics in there. But I think you're seeing it show up in terms of the MRR per cab as well as the overall revenue growth rates and then particularly dropping it to the AFFO per share results.\nJon Atkin: And then lastly, the new logos you mentioned, are there any particular verticals where you're seeing penetration that's driving the vertical? And then on the churn side, anything to kind of think about for the coming quarter or year around where you might fall within your typical range for MRR churn? Thanks.\nCharles Meyers: You always get full value for your questions, Jon. So, new logos, I would say, the -- I think we're seeing a pretty varied set of -- across verticals in terms of -- we're not really seeing a heavy concentration. I think that more -- I would say that more, what I would consider, data-centric or data-intensive industries are where we're seeing that focus on digital transformation and on AI. And so we talked about some of those in terms of transportation, healthcare, et cetera, and we've identified a few wins there. But interestingly, things like manufacturing have been tremendously strong for us. Retail has been tremendously strong for us. Financial Services, very strong, very forward-leaning posture on AI, a very forward-leaning posture on cloud, but one that is moderated by sort of compliance, security, distributed infrastructure requirements, et cetera. And so they continue to be that sort of ideal customer for us that really is using a broad range of infrastructure options but wants to place their data and some of their private infrastructure in proximity to all that. And so we have seen, I think, very strong performance across verticals on new logos. It seems like every earnings report has a different highlight in terms of what we're talking about on new logos. And then on churn, I think we kind of gave the key highlights there. We are, again, well within our range, a little bit of churn that we are either being proactive about or that we're being sort of receptive to customers looking to optimize footprints because we believe there's meaningful upside there. And again, I think an environment that in transparency does have some level of optimization from customers who maybe were buying a little more than they needed at, I think, in the 2021, 2022 timeframe, but I think are really tightening that up to ensure that they're buying just what they need and then adapting to the multi -- the hybrid and multi-cloud architectures. And so churn is something that I think we have to continue to really keep a close eye on and right now, they're performing where we would have expected in terms of our churn as a percentage of MR.\nJon Atkin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next caller is David Barden with Bank of America. You may go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Hey guys, thanks so much. Two questions, if I could, please. Just Keith, apologies for my voice. Keith, what -- I'm trying to kind of understand my takeaways for the 2024 trajectory. You've had a stronger-than-expected year-to-date through 3Q and you're guiding to kind of a weaker-than-expected jumping off point in 4Q into 2024, but then you're talking about the strong bookings. And so I'm wondering if it's too easy to read into the fourth quarter and maybe we should be looking at the second half as a jumping off point for first half 2024 rather than the fourth quarter specifically? And then the second question, if I could. Maybe Charles, when you mentioned that your churn is 4K and the new clients are coming in to 547, what does that look like? Is that like 1/10 for every three new 4s? Or is that literally just the directional movement of the new client is 50% more power dense? Thank you.\nKeith Taylor: So, David, let me -- so I'll take the first question and then pass to Charles. Thank you for the questions. I think it's important for us to highlight and share with everybody how the business is performing. Very much like Charles has said, the company is performing well. And notwithstanding the comments around the billing cabinets because you can't -- you don't grow revenues like you grow revenues as we did over $40 million quarter-over-quarter when you don't -- you're not creating value, and it's coming through price and volume and all the things that we do. So, as you sort of pass forward to the fourth quarter, again, a nice step-up in both recurring and non-recurring revenue. I think at midpoint of guide, we're up $73 million over the prior quarter on a neutral basis -- on a currency-neutral basis. And so that's an impressive increase. And so let me give you a little bit of a size on the non-recurring piece. You've seen non-recurring being relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. Ebbs and flows generally with a large deal done in the xScale business. But this -- the xScale business, we see an order of magnitude of roughly $30 million. So, that gives you a sense of the size of the uplift in non-recurring. That leaves you with plenty of room on the recurring revenue. Again, $73 million in the midpoint of guide. So, what's going on in the cost side of the equation? Well, there's always some seasonality as we all know. But as we sort of said in our prepared remarks, there's two things that I want to bring to the top. Number one, no surprise, the company is working hard to be as judicious as we need to be with our spend, including our corporate real estate assets. And so we've embedded a fairly large charge inside the quarter relating to corporate real estate. And so the order of magnitude of think of that as a $20 million to $30 million range, just to size it for you. The second piece is, yes, the business, as you know, we've been able to deliver a good year, and we're setting ourselves up now for 2024. And that's where our focus is because we know we had strong bookings in the third quarter. We feel we're really well-positioned for booking activity in the fourth quarter. And that sort of sets the stage or sets the table for 2024. And so we did accelerate some costs into the year into the last quarter, both on an OpEx basis, and you can certainly see it on a recurring CapEx basis. And so we made that decision, one because we could deliver better than the market was anticipating and simultaneously make sure that we get some of the investments behind us so we could focus 2024 on things that were important for 2024. And so it's a combination of those two things that really have made a difference if you look at flow-throughs. But as you then enter into the new year, you've really set the stage for a good start to 2024. If we deliver against those that booking expectation, I think it just -- it sets the table really nicely for a 2024 start. So, let me leave that. I hope I answered your question there.\nDavid Barden: No. Thanks Keith.\nCharles Meyers: So, I'll take the second one, David. It's pretty simple, really, in terms of -- it's really what I was talking about there in terms of the 4 to 5.7 is really a macro average, an overall aggregate average for the for the -- again, that's for the first three quarters. We basically said, look, this is the number of cabinets that were churned out over that period of time. And this is the total contracted power that was churned out over that time, divide those two and you get four. And then here's all the new cabinets we build -- booked during the year. And here's the new contracted power on those and to buy those and you get 5.7. And the reason I think it's important to characterize that as an average, I actually think it will be harder for us to deal with it was all exactly 4-kilowatt cabinets being churned and all exactly 5.7 kilowatt cabinets being added. The reality is that the workloads have quite a range. We still see meaningful demand well below that 5.7 and obvious -- that's obvious since that's an average. And then you see some meaningfully above that, right? And you might see we might see deals that are 10, 15, 20 or more kilowatts per cab. And as we said, we may even be looking at liquid cooling to support some of those very high density requirements. And so -- and I think that's important in that I think it's an opportunity for us as we have this dynamic of space being freed up to the extent that we can match that up with power and cool it appropriately using liquid cooling or other means or traditional air cooling means, then I think that's an opportunity to unlock more value from the platform. And so that's a dynamic that we're very focused on. But what I gave you in terms of the 4 to 5.7 is really an overall average.\nDavid Barden: No, helpful color guys. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. You may go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. Good afternoon. First, curious if you could discuss the factors that led to the decision to adjust capital allocation and boost the dividend per share in this fourth quarter and then just kind of the go-forward metric of how to think about dividend growth? And then I have a follow-up, if that's okay.\nKeith Taylor: Yes. Sure. Michael, the -- well, just broadly speaking, clearly, we think of ourselves as very advantaged by the cash that we keep on our balance sheet, the liquidity position we have available to us and how we're setting up our debt structure, particularly in low rate environments. And I think that will continue to hold true as we look into 2024 and certainly into 2025. No surprise. I know this wasn't directly in your question, I'll come to the dividend in a moment. The cost of debt is going up. And so we're trying to be very judicious how we raise our capital, continue to find balance. But we know and we've set the stage, if you will, coming out of the Analyst Day for a five-year view on what we think we can accomplish as a business. And we know how much capital incrementally we need to raise all else being equal inside that business plan. And so you're seeing us execute against and strike where we can when it's opportunistically favorable to the business. And that's why you saw those rates Swiss franc put on the balance sheet right away. We've got the positive carry and so we move on and that's good liquid capital for us.  So, then as you look about how do we distribute some of the cash flow back to our investors. And no surprise, we are -- we've made a commitment to pay out 100% of the taxable income inside the qualified structure. And the way that, that happens is through a distribution of the dividend. And basically, you limit your taxable income and avoid excise taxes, if you pay out that dividend. Now, with the business, we've been saying this for the last few quarters, and I'm sure it's not lost on everybody. The operating performance of our business, and that's what the primary, that is not the -- that is the sole makeup of our dividend. We're returning capital through strong operational performance and that -- the taxable operational performance of the business, which, of course, mimics the book operational performance has been accelerating. And over the years, and certainly lately, we've been doing all we can to, if you will, to mitigate a point of time where we've under distributed. But we're at a point now where we can't hold back that momentum any longer. And as a result, we want to give our tax teams the flexibility to manage the tax provisions and tax positions this year instead of having to worry about what we file in September of next year for 2023. So, we accelerated the decision. But -- so that's sort of why we did it in Q4 and then just the sheer size of the investment or the distribution is to give you a sense of the momentum in the business and how much the taxable income is growing relative to the business. And so we needed to release that and create capacity for ourselves, not just for this quarter and closing out the 2023 year, but certainly for 2024 as well. As we look forward, we have pretty darn good visibility on what we think that taxable income is going to look like. And so we wanted to mitigate basically an under disputed issue in 2024, and we just -- we solved the problem by making this decision.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. And then just on one other thing that you mentioned earlier. You mentioned the opportunity to try to improve the power density in the existing footprint. And just curious if you could share with us how the power utilization of your portfolio compares to the cabinet utilization of your portfolio? And the opportunity based on access to the utility load and thinking about the cost, like how much further can you take the power in the existing portfolio? Thanks.\nCharles Meyers: Yes. Great question, Mike. It's unfortunately not a particularly simple matter. But I will give you an answer to your question, which is our power utilization is actually meaningfully lower than our cabinet utilization, right? And so that does represent, I think, some opportunity for us if we -- to the extent that we can match space and power and have the appropriate cooling requirements to unlock productive value creation capacity from the platform. Again, it's not super straightforward because you have to ensure that you can -- you have the -- draw can be very different facility to facility. And your ability to augment available power is very substantially either due to availability of power from the utility or from our own ability to do that in terms of the equipment available to power distribution in the facility, et cetera. And so I do think that there is opportunity there to be had. And I think it is something that is working to our advantage in terms of the kind of overall dynamics of the business now, but one where we always have to continue to ensure that we are delivering superior reliability to our customers, understand exactly what their requirements are, can cool that -- can cool it properly, deliver the reliability and resiliency they need and sort of manage all those factors simultaneously. So, I do think, though, that you are -- I think you're properly interpreting an opportunity there that says, okay, well, then if you're churning cabinets out at lower, selling them at higher and you have some sort of headroom from a power perspective and you're freeing up space or cabinet capacity, can you take action to sort of augment power over time in ways that would allow you to create value. I think the answer is yes, and we'll be hard at work figuring out how to do that best.\nKeith Taylor: Mike, maybe I can just add on 1 other thing to what Charles has said. One of the main objectives coming from Ralph's organization is to drive efficiency into the IBXs. So, we're perpetually looking for ways to drive more efficiency and create the capacity -- incremental capacity that Charles refers to. We're also looking at new design and construction techniques to run them more efficiently. And that drives down our PUE and PUE is good for the customer. In some cases, we're held to certain PUE with our customers. And so it drives the efficiency into the business and create that capacity that hopefully we can resell. But these investments, particularly with some of the older data centers to the extent a new technology or certain components of our MCE become available, and we choose to make an investment. You're not expanding as necessarily the footprint but you're making an investment that frees up stranded capacity or energy, that works really well for the business and as I said, for the customer.\nCharles Meyers: Yes. And one last comment I'd make, Mike, is that I do think this highlights what a very different business we have. Because when you're talking about a very large number of customers in a facility, that's extremely different. So, we wouldn't have that same view relative to an xScale facility, for example, right? I mean that you design it as a certain power capacity, you sell that to a customer, sometimes an entire building to a customer at that and sort of that is what it is. One or two customers sort of it doesn't matter. But when you're talking about very large numbers of customers with very widely ranging power requirements, it represents both a challenge and an opportunity and 1 that I think, over time, we've developed a set of processes and capabilities to manage quite effectively.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next caller is Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. You may go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Appreciate it. Thanks for the question. So, maybe you could touch a little bit, Charles, on the kind of the enterprise sales in the quarter in the pipeline? I know with rates moving higher recently and some concerns around potential recession in the US. Are you seeing any of them pulling back an IT spend to being more cautious in their outlook as they look kind of at their IT stack and hybrid cloud migration and any signs that they're kind of optimizing costs that are evident in any of your churn numbers?\nCharles Meyers: Yes. Yes. Great question, Eric. As we said in the script, you heard me say that it was an environment that we -- I thought was characterized by customer caution. And I think that's true. And so I -- as I -- and I've been out as I very much like to be out in the field with our teams, both in the data centers, in the sales offices, with customers, with partners, et cetera. And I think I would say that there is a sentiment that says, hey, customers are very forward leaning from the standpoint of recognizing they need to invest in digital and digital transformation and AI, although I think they're very early in those endeavors in many cases. But they also are facing the natural constraints that are created in a more challenging macro environment from a budgetary standpoint. So, oftentimes, they're trying -- one, they're trying to move dollars around to ensure that they can fund their digital transformation initiatives. And two, they're saying, hey, what can we do to get more out of our -- more bang for the buck out of our digital dollars we spend or the IT dollars that we spend broadly. And so I think you're seeing that in terms of -- one thing that you're seeing a lot of people saying, hey, we really have to look at our cloud spend and understand that and determine what the right mix of clouds is and whether or not there are certain workloads that we've attempted to lift and shift to cloud, that we may want to think differently about or you're seeing people saying, hey, are there things that eventually we need to get into a cloud-native sort of -- as cloud-native workloads and move them. And so it certainly is working in all those directions. But I would say I think people are -- customers are really working hard to optimize their digital infrastructure. And I think we can be a real resource to them. The network is another area, right? And we talked about Network Edge and customers being very responsive to that product offering. I think that is most commonly in the context of WAN re-architecture and trying to save money on networking and still deliver higher levels of performance. And so I would say I think there is some level of caution out there, but I think that it is one where people are really trying to make room to make the investments in digital and thinking about what is the right long-term architecture, hybrid, multi-cloud distributed and data-centric. And I think that positions us well to be a trusted partner to them on that journey.\nEric Luebchow: Great. Thanks. And just one quick follow-up. I was curious on the xScale kind of update, a development in Silicon Valley saw. So you made it clear that your desire to expand more into the United States. Maybe as you look at the set of opportunities in the US, is development the best option you see today to attack that opportunity? Or is M&A another lever that you continue to evaluate in the US for xScale?\nCharles Meyers: Yes, it's a great question. I certainly don't think we would be opposed to that. I think if we believe there were assets that were available under reasonable terms from an M&A perspective and that we could do that, that would likely be a transaction that would be executed through some sort of xScale venture -- joint venture vehicle. And so I wouldn't -- we're not opposed to that. But I do think that probably our immediate focus is on development and we'll keep you updated on both of those fronts as appropriate.\nEric Luebchow: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead.\nNick Del Deo: Hey, thanks for fitting me in. I guess to follow up on the xScale question in the US I guess, what do you view as different about AI training that makes you want to support those deployments via xScale in the US relative to cloud where you -- if I understand it correctly, you didn't see the opportunity as worth pursuing given how competitive the supply environment is?\nCharles Meyers: Yes, I mean I think there's a couple of things there. One, I do think that the -- at the time that we made that judgment and we're communicating that judgment to the market, I would say that the supply demand characteristics and therefore, the return profile of xScale in the US market was less than stellar. I think that dynamic is changing. I think the supply/demand sort of landscape in the US, both because of sort of traditional AZ demand or hyperscale demand for the form -- in the form of hyperscale for AZs and those kind of things, combined with now a meaningful acceleration in demand for training, I think, changes the supply-demand profile. And then I would -- and so I do think there is a more attractive market in which to sell. The other thing that I think is something maybe that we appreciate even more powerfully now is and we talked about this when we did xScale to begin with. We said, look, we need to continue have really well developed and constructive relationships the major players in the digital ecosystem and obviously, the hyperscalers are at the top of that list. And so we continue to work hard to make sure that we can be a partner in meeting their capacity needs and not only on the retail basis, but at least as one of probably a number of providers that they're going to need to leverage in the xScale arena. And then the last thing that I think is maybe underappreciated is I think it's also important that we continue to maintain our scale and relevance in the supply chain. And so we -- I think we are very well-positioned there. And I think our procurement and supply chain teams have done an extraordinary job there. And I think part of the reason that they can do that job so well, one is the strength of our balance sheet; and two, is the scale of our operation. And so I think xScale is also a way for us to continue to maintain our position in that regard.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. Are you able to share anything regarding how you're thinking about returns here or is that premature? And I guess, any progress in terms of line up partner for domestic xScale?\nCharles Meyers: Yes, I mean I think that last part is probably premature. But I think the first, I don't think we see a dramatic shift in the overall return profile. I mean we have seen it already, I think, improved where it was, where I think it was single-digits there for a while. If you were lucky, it was high single-digits, where I think you're now seeing sort of full return yields and levered returns even above that. And for us, given that we get some advantages in the structure associated with fee streams, et cetera, I think -- and it's still an attractive equity return profile for us. And so I think that -- but I think those returns have gone up where you're seeing cash-on-cash yields that are meaningfully higher, meaningful up into the double-digits and much more attractive now. So, I do think that, that return profile has improved. It's going to continue to be a very competitive business, though. It's -- and one that will have a very return -- a different return profile than retail, which is, again, why we want to preserve our balance sheet firepower to the extent we can to continue to cultivate our retail business, while at the same time, recognizing the strategic importance of continuing to be active in the xScale market.\nNick Del Deo: Okay. Thanks Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Yes Nick.\nChip Newcom: This concludes our Q3 conference call. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Good bye. And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time and have a great rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Keith Taylor",
            "content": "Great. Thanks Charles and good afternoon to everyone. Let me start by saying I hope you and your families are doing well. Now, notwithstanding these complex and difficult times, we continue to remain bullish about our business and the opportunities ahead as we work hard to expand our strategic and preferential position in the marketplace. As you all know, one of the core tenets of our strategy revolves around long-term shareholder value creation. With that in mind, we continue to build capacity in markets that will enhance our platform positioning and differentiate our offerings into the future. Also, we continue to work diligently to maintain rigor with our pricing strategies while closely overseeing our spending decisions. As it relates to our capital structure, we've been able to maintain a highly advantaged balance sheet with ample liquidity and lower leverage. This gives us the flexibility to opportunistically access the capital markets under terms and conditions that are beneficial to us. In addition, we're actively working to support other strategic operating goals, including how and where we source our supply chain, including energy costs, while increasing our investments in and around our future first sustainability initiatives, both highly important matters for our customers. Lastly, we remain pleased with our efforts to manage our derivative risks, including our exposure to foreign currencies and interest rates. Moving on to the business, we continue to perform well. In Q3, we had solid gross and net bookings with strong customer demand. Our pricing dynamics are very positive. MRR churn is well within our targeted range. Also, given the tight supply environment across many of our metros, we and our customers continue to look for ways to optimize deployment, including increasing the power density of the cabinets sold. This drives improved bottom line profitability and higher return on invested capital. Global MRR per cabinet was up $57 quarter-over-quarter to $2,214 per cabinet, a 12% increase on our yield year-on-year on a constant currency basis. With respect to our net cabinets billing metric, it remains flat compared to Q2, largely due to the meaningful increase in density of cabinet and the timing of bookings and churn at the end of the quarter. We have a solid backlog of booked but not yet installed cabinets and the depth of our pipeline and the related coverage ratios support an expected strong bookings performance to close out our year. Now, let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Know that all comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q3 revenues were $2.061 billion, up 14% over the same quarter last year due to strong recurring revenue growth and power price increases. Non-recurring revenues remained flat compared to the prior quarter. Although it was not before non-recurring revenues, particularly those attributable to our xScale business are inherently lumpy, for Q4, our guide implies a meaningful step-up on non-recurring revenues attributed to a number of deals expected to close across different markets this quarter. Q3 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $1 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $936 million or 45% of revenues, up 9% over the same quarter last year due to strong operating performance. Looking forward, our Q4 adjusted EBITDA is expected to remain roughly flat due to the timing of our spend and specific one-time costs attributed to corporate real estate activities. Q3 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, includes a $1 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and $2 million of integration costs. Global Q3 AFFO was $772 million, above our expectations due to strong business performance and timing of recurring CapEx spend. Q3 AFFO included minimal FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 MR turned step down to 2.2%, and we expect Q4 MR churn to remain consistent with our Q3 levels in the lower half of our 2% to 2.5% quarterly guidance range. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized and constant currency basis, EMEA and APAC were our fastest-growing regions at 26% and 10%, respectively, followed by our Americas region at 7% year-over-year growth. The Americas region had a solid quarter across many of our key metros, and we experienced strong public sector activity. As it relates to AI, sales activity discussed in Charles' remarks, the vast majority of the demand is destined for Americas footprint. And as highlighted by Charles, this quarter, we won a mix of AI training, inference and networking deployments with the pipeline of anticipated deals to follow. Our EMEA business had a strong quarter led by our UK and Dutch markets and record digital services bookings. In EMEA, as highlighted previously, we continue to lean into our future-first sustainability strategy, including implementing heat export initiatives into Frankfurt, Helsinki, and Paris communities while supporting other innovative environmental initiatives to support many other communities and where we operate. And finally, the Asia-Pacific region saw a solid performance led by our Hong Kong, India, and Singapore markets. Capacity constraints exist across a number of our markets, particularly Singapore. These supply constraints will help drive strong deal discipline and pricing power in these markets. During 2024, we'll be opening new markets in India, Indonesia, and Malaysia, expanding our APAC platform and ecosystems in pursuit of larger opportunities given the demand for digital infrastructure. And now looking at our capital structure. Please refer to Slide 8. Our net leverage remains low relative to our peers at 3.5 times our annualized adjusted EBITDA. Our balance sheet increased slightly to approximately $31.7 billion including an unrestricted cash balance of over $2.3 billion. Our cash balance remained flat quarter-over-quarter as our strong operating cash flow and financing activity was offset by our investment in growth CapEx and the quarterly cash dividend. As I've previously noted, we've been opportunistically looking to raise additional debt capital in reduced rate environments. To that end, in September, we raised $337 million of Swiss Franc denominated five-year paper at an attractive 2.875% rate. Additionally, during the quarter, we executed an incremental $230 million of ATM forward equity sales, which we expect to settle alongside our Q2 ATM forward contract in late 2023. These financing transactions will help fund our 2024 growth initiatives, alongside other sources of capital while allowing us to maintain our strategic flexibility. Also in September, we published our 2023 green bond allocation report. As highlighted in the report, we have now fully allocated the net proceeds from our green bonds aligning our financing efforts with our commitment to create a more environmentally friendly data center footprint. Turning to Slide 9, for the quarter, capital expenditures were $618 million, including recurring CapEx of $52 million. Since our last earnings call, we opened six new retail projects, including two new data centers in Dubai and Montreal. We also purchased our Dublin 1 and Montreal 1 IBX assets and land for development in Manchester in Washington, D.C. Revenue from owned assets were 64% of recurring revenues for the quarter. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our 174 stabilized assets increased revenues by 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Our stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and generated a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for our updated summary of 2023 guidance and bridges. Do note, all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. For the full year 2023, we're maintaining our underlying revenue outlook with expected top line growth of 14% to 15% or approximately 9% growth, excluding the impact of power costs passed through to our customers, a reflection of our continued strong execution. We are raising our underlying 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $17 million due to favorable operating costs and lower integration spend and we're raising our underlying AFFO guidance by $27 million to now grow between 12% and 14% compared to the previous year. AFFO per share is now expected to grow between 10% and 11%. CapEx is expected to remain in the $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion range, including approximately $215 million of on-balance sheet xScale spend, which we expect to be reimbursed for when these assets are transferred to JVs early next year and about $225 million of recurring CapEx spend, an increase over the prior quarter as we accelerate costs into Q4. Lastly, given our strong operating performance and our historically low AFFO payout ratio, we've accelerated the timing of our cash dividend increase into Q4 of this year from Q1 of next year. As a result, the quarterly cash dividend will increase by 25% to $4.26 per share this quarter. Looking forward, we expect our annual cash dividend growth rate will track at or above our AFFO per share growth rate for a number of years. So, let me stop here and turn the call back to Charles. So, David, let me -- so I'll take the first question and then pass to Charles. Thank you for the questions. I think it's important for us to highlight and share with everybody how the business is performing. Very much like Charles has said, the company is performing well. And notwithstanding the comments around the billing cabinets because you can't -- you don't grow revenues like you grow revenues as we did over $40 million quarter-over-quarter when you don't -- you're not creating value, and it's coming through price and volume and all the things that we do. So, as you sort of pass forward to the fourth quarter, again, a nice step-up in both recurring and non-recurring revenue. I think at midpoint of guide, we're up $73 million over the prior quarter on a neutral basis -- on a currency-neutral basis. And so that's an impressive increase. And so let me give you a little bit of a size on the non-recurring piece. You've seen non-recurring being relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. Ebbs and flows generally with a large deal done in the xScale business. But this -- the xScale business, we see an order of magnitude of roughly $30 million. So, that gives you a sense of the size of the uplift in non-recurring. That leaves you with plenty of room on the recurring revenue. Again, $73 million in the midpoint of guide. So, what's going on in the cost side of the equation? Well, there's always some seasonality as we all know. But as we sort of said in our prepared remarks, there's two things that I want to bring to the top. Number one, no surprise, the company is working hard to be as judicious as we need to be with our spend, including our corporate real estate assets. And so we've embedded a fairly large charge inside the quarter relating to corporate real estate. And so the order of magnitude of think of that as a $20 million to $30 million range, just to size it for you. The second piece is, yes, the business, as you know, we've been able to deliver a good year, and we're setting ourselves up now for 2024. And that's where our focus is because we know we had strong bookings in the third quarter. We feel we're really well-positioned for booking activity in the fourth quarter. And that sort of sets the stage or sets the table for 2024. And so we did accelerate some costs into the year into the last quarter, both on an OpEx basis, and you can certainly see it on a recurring CapEx basis. And so we made that decision, one because we could deliver better than the market was anticipating and simultaneously make sure that we get some of the investments behind us so we could focus 2024 on things that were important for 2024. And so it's a combination of those two things that really have made a difference if you look at flow-throughs. But as you then enter into the new year, you've really set the stage for a good start to 2024. If we deliver against those that booking expectation, I think it just -- it sets the table really nicely for a 2024 start. So, let me leave that. I hope I answered your question there. Yes. Sure. Michael, the -- well, just broadly speaking, clearly, we think of ourselves as very advantaged by the cash that we keep on our balance sheet, the liquidity position we have available to us and how we're setting up our debt structure, particularly in low rate environments. And I think that will continue to hold true as we look into 2024 and certainly into 2025. No surprise. I know this wasn't directly in your question, I'll come to the dividend in a moment. The cost of debt is going up. And so we're trying to be very judicious how we raise our capital, continue to find balance. But we know and we've set the stage, if you will, coming out of the Analyst Day for a five-year view on what we think we can accomplish as a business. And we know how much capital incrementally we need to raise all else being equal inside that business plan. And so you're seeing us execute against and strike where we can when it's opportunistically favorable to the business. And that's why you saw those rates Swiss franc put on the balance sheet right away. We've got the positive carry and so we move on and that's good liquid capital for us.  So, then as you look about how do we distribute some of the cash flow back to our investors. And no surprise, we are -- we've made a commitment to pay out 100% of the taxable income inside the qualified structure. And the way that, that happens is through a distribution of the dividend. And basically, you limit your taxable income and avoid excise taxes, if you pay out that dividend. Now, with the business, we've been saying this for the last few quarters, and I'm sure it's not lost on everybody. The operating performance of our business, and that's what the primary, that is not the -- that is the sole makeup of our dividend. We're returning capital through strong operational performance and that -- the taxable operational performance of the business, which, of course, mimics the book operational performance has been accelerating. And over the years, and certainly lately, we've been doing all we can to, if you will, to mitigate a point of time where we've under distributed. But we're at a point now where we can't hold back that momentum any longer. And as a result, we want to give our tax teams the flexibility to manage the tax provisions and tax positions this year instead of having to worry about what we file in September of next year for 2023. So, we accelerated the decision. But -- so that's sort of why we did it in Q4 and then just the sheer size of the investment or the distribution is to give you a sense of the momentum in the business and how much the taxable income is growing relative to the business. And so we needed to release that and create capacity for ourselves, not just for this quarter and closing out the 2023 year, but certainly for 2024 as well. As we look forward, we have pretty darn good visibility on what we think that taxable income is going to look like. And so we wanted to mitigate basically an under disputed issue in 2024, and we just -- we solved the problem by making this decision. Mike, maybe I can just add on 1 other thing to what Charles has said. One of the main objectives coming from Ralph's organization is to drive efficiency into the IBXs. So, we're perpetually looking for ways to drive more efficiency and create the capacity -- incremental capacity that Charles refers to. We're also looking at new design and construction techniques to run them more efficiently. And that drives down our PUE and PUE is good for the customer. In some cases, we're held to certain PUE with our customers. And so it drives the efficiency into the business and create that capacity that hopefully we can resell. But these investments, particularly with some of the older data centers to the extent a new technology or certain components of our MCE become available, and we choose to make an investment. You're not expanding as necessarily the footprint but you're making an investment that frees up stranded capacity or energy, that works really well for the business and as I said, for the customer."

            "name": "Charles Meyers",
            "content": "Thank you, Chip. Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Despite an increasingly complex macro environment, we delivered another solid quarter of results and continue to drive strong value creation, raising both our dividend and our AFFO per share outlook for the full year. While we continue to operate in an environment characterized by customer caution, this caution is balanced by a clear commitment to digital transformation and accelerating interest in AI and a growing reliance on Equinix as a critical partner in designing and implementing hybrid, multi-cloud, and data-centric architectures. Customers continue to see digital as a critical priority, and they remain focused on optimizing existing infrastructure spend and capabilities across cloud, network and other categories. Demand remains strong. New logo growth is accelerating, and we see a highly favorable pricing environment, allowing us to deliver higher MRR per cabinet yields driven by price, power density, and strong interconnection demand. The net result is solid revenue growth, a strong forward pipeline and continued optimism about our differentiated ability to deliver compelling value to our customers and in turn, to our shareholders. In Q3, our go-to-market engine continued to execute well with more than 4,200 deals in the quarter across more than 3,100 customers, including record new logos from high-value targeted customers. We saw solid performance across all aspects of our platform strategy with data center services, digital services, and our xScale, all coming together to address the evolving demands of our customers and strong cross-regional bookings highlighting the power of our unmatched global reach. On the AI front, we continue to cultivate and win significant opportunities across our existing customer base and with AI-specific prospects. A recent Gartner poll found 55% of organizations are in pilot or production mode with generative AI. We are seeing this manifest in accelerated interest from both enterprise customers and from emerging service providers looking to service this demand. We see strong similarities between the evolving AI demand and the multi-tiered architectures that have characterized the cloud build-out for the past eight years. And believe that our broad portfolio of offerings in tandem with our key technology partners will allow us to capture high-value opportunities across the AI value chain along three key vectors. First, in our retail business, we will aggressively pursue magnetic AI service provider deployments to support on-ramps, inference nodes and smaller scale training needs. We are well-positioned here with nearly 40% market share of the on-ramps to the major cloud service providers, key players in the AI ecosystem. And in Q3, we're proud to have been recognized at a 2023 Google Cloud Customer Awards winner for our work supporting Google AI technology. Key wins in this area for Q3 included Core Wheat, a specialized GPU cloud provider, deploying networking nodes at Equinix leveraging our unique multi-cloud on-ramps and network connectivity across multiple metros. And Lambda, selecting Platform Equinix to offer customers expanded regional connectivity, higher networking performance, security and scale for an enterprise-grade GPU cloud, dedicated to large language models and generative AI workloads. Second, we intend to meaningfully augment our xScale portfolio, including in North America to pursue strategic large-scale AI training deployments with the top hyperscalers and other key AI ecosystem players, including the potential to serve highly targeted enterprise demand. We expect some builds will be tightly coupled with our retail campuses like our newly announced Silicon Valley 12x asset, while other builds will be larger-scale campuses in locations with access to significant power capacity. And finally, in response to burgeoning enterprise AI demand, we will leverage our unique advantages to position Platform Equinix as the place where private AI happens, allowing customers to place compute resources in proximity to data and seamlessly leverage public cloud capabilities, all while maintaining control of high-value proprietary data. We also anticipate a dramatic acceleration in inference workloads and see Equinix as well-positioned to deliver performance and economic benefits derived from our reach, network density and cloud adjacency. While still early, we're seeing broad-based demand for private AI from digital leaders with specific wins in the transportation, education, public sector and healthcare verticals, including Harrison.ai, a clinician-led healthcare artificial intelligence company that is dedicated to addressing the inequality and capacity limitations in our health care system, by developing AI-powered tools in radiology and pathology. An exciting opportunity that not only drives our business, but clearly aligns with Equinix values. As AI demand accelerates, we are adapting our product portfolio and our physical platform in response to evolving customer requirements. In terms of data center design, we're using our co-innovation facility in Ashburn to evaluate technologies to support escalating power requirements and have already commercialized our early work in this area with liquid cooling solutions that are supportable in all markets, including support for direct-to-chip liquid cooling in 45 markets across all three regions. We are already supporting significant liquid cool deployments across our range of deployment sizes and densities and we look forward to sharing more with you on our progress in this space. Turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q3 were $2.06 billion, up 14% year-over-year driven by strong recurring revenue growth and power price increases. Adjusted EBITDA was up 9% year-over-year, and AFFO per share was better than our expectations due to strong operating performance and timing of recurring CapEx spend. Interconnection revenues grew 9% year-over-year with continued strength from Equinix Fabric. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our data center services portfolio continues to perform well. Given the strong underlying demand for digital infrastructure and the long duration in delivering new capacity, a factor that continues to drive positive pricing trends, we're investing broadly across our global footprint. We currently have 56 major projects underway in 39 markets across 23 countries, including 14 xScale builds that will deliver more than 100 megawatts of capacity once opened. More than 50% of our expansion capital is supporting capacity in our major metros where we have strong visibility to fill rates. Recurring revenues from customers deployed in more than one region stepped up 1% quarter-over-quarter to 77% as customers continue to move to more distributed architectures. On interconnection, we now have over 460,000 total interconnections with 4,200 net interconnections added in Q3 thanks to healthy gross adds, offset somewhat by continued grooming activity and consolidations into higher bandwidth connections. Equinix Fabric saw continued momentum with record port orders and significant growth in provision bandwidth, up 8% quarter-over-quarter to more than 200 terabits per second. Internet Exchange had another strong quarter in APAC with peak traffic in the region, surpassing the Americas for the first time. Globally, peak traffic was up 9% quarter-over-quarter and 27% year-over-year to nearly 35 terabits per second. Recent interconnection and ecosystem wins include Southern Cross, expanding their relationship with Equinix by deploying their SX NEXT subsea cable into our LA4 IBX to boost aggregate capacity on their US to Australia and New Zealand network by 50%. And the Warsaw Stock Exchange, migrating their primary matching engine and trading system to Equinix' Warsaw 3 IBX to offer more capabilities and enhanced trading performance. We continue to invest behind our platform strategy with revenue growth from our digital services portfolio significantly over-indexing relative to the broader business, including strong adoption of our network edge offering by enterprise customers. We're also seeing momentum in expanding our partnerships with leading technology companies, including the recent announcement of NetApp storage on Equinix Metal, which is an integrated full stack solution that provides enterprise customers low latency access to all clouds while keeping control of their data, a critical consideration for AI workloads. Key digital services wins this quarter included McGraw Hill, a leading educational publishing company, deploying virtual hubs using Network Edge across multiple markets to connect to key cloud providers via Equinix Fabric. And a significant win with a global gaming company using Equinix Metal to support a major new product launch. Our channel program delivered another strong quarter, amplifying the reach of our sales team and accounting for over 65% of new logos with wins across a wide range of industry segments focusing on digital transformation initiatives. We continue to see growth from partners like AT&T, Cisco, Dell, and HPE. Key wins included a top five US public school district seeking to modernize aging IT infrastructure while improving systems uptime and enhancing cybersecurity. This win executed with partners, Dell Technology Managed Services, Carasoft, and ImpEx Technologies, will deliver low latency, multi-cloud connectivity and secure network access to key ecosystem resources while lowering operational expenses. Now, let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results from the quarter. Thanks Keith. In closing, we continue to see strong demand as customers embrace AI and advance their digital transformation agendas with infrastructure that is more distributed, more cloud connected and more ecosystem enabled than ever before. Despite a variety of cross currents in the business, we are translating healthy bookings growth, a favorable pricing environment, and increasing power densities into strong increases in cabinet yield. These dynamics, combined with the continued focus on driving operating leverage and expense discipline through the business, are allowing us to deliver compelling value on a per share basis. As we close out 2023 and look towards 2024, our forward-looking strategy and vision for our platform will enable us to amplify our unique strengths, leveraging them to expand our market opportunity, and drive sustainable growth in a rapidly evolving landscape. We remain optimistic about the road ahead and steadfast in our commitment to show up every day in service too, starting with the resolve to align, inspire, and empower our teams around our strategy and our mission, enabling them to deliver durable value and meaningful impact to our customers, our shareholders and the communities in which we operate. So, let me stop there and open it up for questions. Yes, you bet, Matt. Yes, we absolutely figured that we would have a question there on the cabs, as you might imagine, key topic in the discussion. I want to start by just reinforcing that the flat cabinet growth is really not driven by a lack of demand, as you heard in the script. We had another really solid bookings quarter with overall deal counts in line with what we've been seeing. And so I think it's not a demand problem, per se. As I said last quarter, look, we recognize billing cab adds have to be part of the growth story over time, but the pressure on the metric is really linked to some other positive dynamics in the business as you sort of alluded to there. So, let me unpack that a little bit for you and give you a little more detail. I think the force that I think maybe we didn't fully appreciate the past couple of quarters or didn't highlight as much as the extent and the pace of the evolution on the power density. And so we really dug into that this quarter and looked at that for the last several quarters. And what we found is really an expanding delta between the power density of our churn cabinets and that of our newly sold cabinet. So, we look back over these first three quarters of 2023, where we've had a flatter profile on the build cabs or billing cabs, and we've turned cabinets over that period an average density of 4 kilowatts per cab, but we've added new billable cabs at an average of 5.7. So, that's really a major factor that our cab equivalent metric is not density adjusted. So, the reality is we've been paddling hard against that increase in density when it comes to cabinet growth. Additionally, and we talked about this in prior calls as well, we do have some capacity constraints, somewhat -- ones in certain markets. And those are driving some proactive churn on our part, and we see a level of customer optimization at the cabinet level similar to what we've been talking about on interconnection, but we're seeing very little customer churn or full customer churn. And so I'm not -- I'm definitely not saying that all of our churn activity is necessarily desirable or wanted. But as you can see in our churn metric, we're managing the overall churn really well within our guided range. So, as I said -- I talked about last quarter, these 37 deployments with really positive mark-to-market when you look at both price and power density and when we look at Q3, we actually saw that general range of 60% to 70% uplift as broadly applicable. So, in other words, our average of our churn cabinets or new cabinets were about 60% to 70% above what we had churned. And so obviously, that dynamic is super attractive in terms of in really explaining why we're driving healthy revenue growth even with the limited growth in billable cabs. So, I mean, we've always said we're not ones to chase volume as a business objective, because I think that often results in a loss of discipline in the process. We're very much playing the long game when it comes to our commercial decision-making. And although cabinet growth is going to have to be a part of the story over time, we're really seeing that the current dynamics are allowing us to drive, as we said, strong MRR per cab, solid stabilized asset growth and really, I think, the return on capital is going to continue to be very favorable. So, I think all of that translates into what we see as the really most critical bottom line, and that's AFFO per share and dividend growth. And I think sort of the results are really strong in that area. So, that's context on the first question and on billable cabs. Second one on AI, definitely seeing it show up. We talked about in the script about a number of deals that we won in the quarter. AI and ML are not new things for us. We kind of talked about that. We've been working, I think, through AI opportunities with digital leaders for several years now. There's a lot happening across the platform. In fact, people don't maybe remember it, but we announced our NVIDIA Launchpad offering with them over two years ago. And really, that's been a unique opportunity for us to get in early with customers as they're piloting AI initiatives in their business and really monitor AI demand in the marketplace. And so we've closed a number of deals with service providers this quarter. There's definitely an emergent set of service providers, Core Wheat and Lambda we talked about that I think are really sources of incremental demand for us. We closed those deals really in the retail footprint focused on networking and inference-type nodes. And I think that what we're seeing most of with customers is working with them on three big questions when they're thinking about AI. Where do I put my data? And I think we're seeing a lot of people looking at sort of cloud adjacent data as the answer. And I think that plays right to our advantages. Secondly, how they bring compute and other data sources in other words, data that's not their own to their own data. And then finally, how do they deliver AI generated business insights to the users of those insights economically and with high performance. And so those really are the areas that we've been deeply engaged with our customers. I think that it's a contributing factor to our probably our best forward-looking pipeline, multi-quarter pipeline that we've seen in a long time. And so I do think AI is a very positive force in the business overall. Yes, I would -- I think our bookings percentage is probably in the 40%-ish range from our channel. You do have to recognize, Frank, and we've been very transparent about this. Our channel is not really a sell-through channel as much. It's really more of a sell with sort of meeting the market. But what we're using is the extensive relationships that our channel partners have, particularly in the broad enterprise to identify and then bring our unique value to the table. And so that often results in essentially a joint selling proposition between ourselves and our partners. And over time, I would say that I think we need to be moving towards a bit more of a sell-through model that would provide even more economic leverage to the model. But we do see our channel wins as very on par in terms of quality of business and our ability to sell into them. Sometimes even more readily -- we can capture incremental wallet share even more readily because of the strength of our channel partners from a relationship perspective inside of those accounts. And so I'd say very much a positive force for us. And as we look at now sort of deepening our channel relationship with key technology partners, we talked about the NetApp offering with NetApp Storage on Metal. Those are great examples. We do have a similar sort of offering with Pure. And so those things are really relevant as customers are saying, hey, we're really deeply thinking about where to place our data, we have technology opinion about the storage providers we'd like to use, and we really would like to that at Equinix to get proximity and adjacency to the cloud. And so I think those -- that's a great example for the kind of deals that we're winning in the channel, and that continues to be an important part of the business. Sure. Yes, I mean I think when you adjust for the PPI, I mean, because the EMEA numbers are obviously done on an as-reported basis are driven significantly by PPI. And so there is that we certainly are seeing, I think, good performance across our regions. APAC, I think, is over a multi-quarter period here, a little -- has more constraints to deal with. And so from a capacity perspective, and as we've talked about Singapore being sort of a prominent example there. But I would also say that in EMEA, I think a more prominent feature for us to continue to be looking at internally. And I realize that there's not as deep a transparency or granularity in the information ability, but the deal mix in EMEA continues to be extremely favorable. And the team has done a really great job going from, what I think, was a little more dependency on some of the large footprint business over time and now in a post xScale world, really shunting the really large stuff off xScale and I think weaning away from a dependency on large footprint demand even in the enterprise I think always has the sort of the prospect of greater churn probability over time. And so the deal mix in EMEA has really shaped nicely, I think, over the last couple of years, and I think really kudos to the team on the ground there to make that happen. Then on pricing, I would just say that I think pricing broadly speaking, is very favorable. Part of that is just simply driven by, I think, an understanding from customers that increases in underlying costs are driving a rising price environment across a whole range of things and so that's one factor. But then I think that perhaps the more important one for us is, I think, being able to deliver really compelling value for them and being able to articulate that effectively to them. And so in terms of the -- where it's coming from, yes, I do think there's continued pricing activity on all -- across our portfolio, interconnection, space and power, and on our digital services. And then I think that the -- and that includes both uplifts on list pricing, and as well as on renewals. And so I think you're really seeing that show up in terms of -- as I just -- I tell you, when you look at a dynamic that says okay, if you're churning cabinets at X and you're selling new cabinets at 1.6 or 1.65x, that's a very attractive dynamic. It's not driven entirely by price because power density is a meaningful part of that. And then actually, new cabs mature even further as interconnection goes into those over time. And so I think those are some of the dynamics on the pricing front. And I think it's has been a little hard for people to hold all that in their head and figure out exactly why that you have some of these dynamics in there. But I think you're seeing it show up in terms of the MRR per cab as well as the overall revenue growth rates and then particularly dropping it to the AFFO per share results. You always get full value for your questions, Jon. So, new logos, I would say, the -- I think we're seeing a pretty varied set of -- across verticals in terms of -- we're not really seeing a heavy concentration. I think that more -- I would say that more, what I would consider, data-centric or data-intensive industries are where we're seeing that focus on digital transformation and on AI. And so we talked about some of those in terms of transportation, healthcare, et cetera, and we've identified a few wins there. But interestingly, things like manufacturing have been tremendously strong for us. Retail has been tremendously strong for us. Financial Services, very strong, very forward-leaning posture on AI, a very forward-leaning posture on cloud, but one that is moderated by sort of compliance, security, distributed infrastructure requirements, et cetera. And so they continue to be that sort of ideal customer for us that really is using a broad range of infrastructure options but wants to place their data and some of their private infrastructure in proximity to all that. And so we have seen, I think, very strong performance across verticals on new logos. It seems like every earnings report has a different highlight in terms of what we're talking about on new logos. And then on churn, I think we kind of gave the key highlights there. We are, again, well within our range, a little bit of churn that we are either being proactive about or that we're being sort of receptive to customers looking to optimize footprints because we believe there's meaningful upside there. And again, I think an environment that in transparency does have some level of optimization from customers who maybe were buying a little more than they needed at, I think, in the 2021, 2022 timeframe, but I think are really tightening that up to ensure that they're buying just what they need and then adapting to the multi -- the hybrid and multi-cloud architectures. And so churn is something that I think we have to continue to really keep a close eye on and right now, they're performing where we would have expected in terms of our churn as a percentage of MR. So, I'll take the second one, David. It's pretty simple, really, in terms of -- it's really what I was talking about there in terms of the 4 to 5.7 is really a macro average, an overall aggregate average for the for the -- again, that's for the first three quarters. We basically said, look, this is the number of cabinets that were churned out over that period of time. And this is the total contracted power that was churned out over that time, divide those two and you get four. And then here's all the new cabinets we build -- booked during the year. And here's the new contracted power on those and to buy those and you get 5.7. And the reason I think it's important to characterize that as an average, I actually think it will be harder for us to deal with it was all exactly 4-kilowatt cabinets being churned and all exactly 5.7 kilowatt cabinets being added. The reality is that the workloads have quite a range. We still see meaningful demand well below that 5.7 and obvious -- that's obvious since that's an average. And then you see some meaningfully above that, right? And you might see we might see deals that are 10, 15, 20 or more kilowatts per cab. And as we said, we may even be looking at liquid cooling to support some of those very high density requirements. And so -- and I think that's important in that I think it's an opportunity for us as we have this dynamic of space being freed up to the extent that we can match that up with power and cool it appropriately using liquid cooling or other means or traditional air cooling means, then I think that's an opportunity to unlock more value from the platform. And so that's a dynamic that we're very focused on. But what I gave you in terms of the 4 to 5.7 is really an overall average. Yes. Great question, Mike. It's unfortunately not a particularly simple matter. But I will give you an answer to your question, which is our power utilization is actually meaningfully lower than our cabinet utilization, right? And so that does represent, I think, some opportunity for us if we -- to the extent that we can match space and power and have the appropriate cooling requirements to unlock productive value creation capacity from the platform. Again, it's not super straightforward because you have to ensure that you can -- you have the -- draw can be very different facility to facility. And your ability to augment available power is very substantially either due to availability of power from the utility or from our own ability to do that in terms of the equipment available to power distribution in the facility, et cetera. And so I do think that there is opportunity there to be had. And I think it is something that is working to our advantage in terms of the kind of overall dynamics of the business now, but one where we always have to continue to ensure that we are delivering superior reliability to our customers, understand exactly what their requirements are, can cool that -- can cool it properly, deliver the reliability and resiliency they need and sort of manage all those factors simultaneously. So, I do think, though, that you are -- I think you're properly interpreting an opportunity there that says, okay, well, then if you're churning cabinets out at lower, selling them at higher and you have some sort of headroom from a power perspective and you're freeing up space or cabinet capacity, can you take action to sort of augment power over time in ways that would allow you to create value. I think the answer is yes, and we'll be hard at work figuring out how to do that best. Yes. And one last comment I'd make, Mike, is that I do think this highlights what a very different business we have. Because when you're talking about a very large number of customers in a facility, that's extremely different. So, we wouldn't have that same view relative to an xScale facility, for example, right? I mean that you design it as a certain power capacity, you sell that to a customer, sometimes an entire building to a customer at that and sort of that is what it is. One or two customers sort of it doesn't matter. But when you're talking about very large numbers of customers with very widely ranging power requirements, it represents both a challenge and an opportunity and 1 that I think, over time, we've developed a set of processes and capabilities to manage quite effectively. Yes. Yes. Great question, Eric. As we said in the script, you heard me say that it was an environment that we -- I thought was characterized by customer caution. And I think that's true. And so I -- as I -- and I've been out as I very much like to be out in the field with our teams, both in the data centers, in the sales offices, with customers, with partners, et cetera. And I think I would say that there is a sentiment that says, hey, customers are very forward leaning from the standpoint of recognizing they need to invest in digital and digital transformation and AI, although I think they're very early in those endeavors in many cases. But they also are facing the natural constraints that are created in a more challenging macro environment from a budgetary standpoint. So, oftentimes, they're trying -- one, they're trying to move dollars around to ensure that they can fund their digital transformation initiatives. And two, they're saying, hey, what can we do to get more out of our -- more bang for the buck out of our digital dollars we spend or the IT dollars that we spend broadly. And so I think you're seeing that in terms of -- one thing that you're seeing a lot of people saying, hey, we really have to look at our cloud spend and understand that and determine what the right mix of clouds is and whether or not there are certain workloads that we've attempted to lift and shift to cloud, that we may want to think differently about or you're seeing people saying, hey, are there things that eventually we need to get into a cloud-native sort of -- as cloud-native workloads and move them. And so it certainly is working in all those directions. But I would say I think people are -- customers are really working hard to optimize their digital infrastructure. And I think we can be a real resource to them. The network is another area, right? And we talked about Network Edge and customers being very responsive to that product offering. I think that is most commonly in the context of WAN re-architecture and trying to save money on networking and still deliver higher levels of performance. And so I would say I think there is some level of caution out there, but I think that it is one where people are really trying to make room to make the investments in digital and thinking about what is the right long-term architecture, hybrid, multi-cloud distributed and data-centric. And I think that positions us well to be a trusted partner to them on that journey. Yes, it's a great question. I certainly don't think we would be opposed to that. I think if we believe there were assets that were available under reasonable terms from an M&A perspective and that we could do that, that would likely be a transaction that would be executed through some sort of xScale venture -- joint venture vehicle. And so I wouldn't -- we're not opposed to that. But I do think that probably our immediate focus is on development and we'll keep you updated on both of those fronts as appropriate. Yes, I mean I think there's a couple of things there. One, I do think that the -- at the time that we made that judgment and we're communicating that judgment to the market, I would say that the supply demand characteristics and therefore, the return profile of xScale in the US market was less than stellar. I think that dynamic is changing. I think the supply/demand sort of landscape in the US, both because of sort of traditional AZ demand or hyperscale demand for the form -- in the form of hyperscale for AZs and those kind of things, combined with now a meaningful acceleration in demand for training, I think, changes the supply-demand profile. And then I would -- and so I do think there is a more attractive market in which to sell. The other thing that I think is something maybe that we appreciate even more powerfully now is and we talked about this when we did xScale to begin with. We said, look, we need to continue have really well developed and constructive relationships the major players in the digital ecosystem and obviously, the hyperscalers are at the top of that list. And so we continue to work hard to make sure that we can be a partner in meeting their capacity needs and not only on the retail basis, but at least as one of probably a number of providers that they're going to need to leverage in the xScale arena. And then the last thing that I think is maybe underappreciated is I think it's also important that we continue to maintain our scale and relevance in the supply chain. And so we -- I think we are very well-positioned there. And I think our procurement and supply chain teams have done an extraordinary job there. And I think part of the reason that they can do that job so well, one is the strength of our balance sheet; and two, is the scale of our operation. And so I think xScale is also a way for us to continue to maintain our position in that regard. Yes, I mean I think that last part is probably premature. But I think the first, I don't think we see a dramatic shift in the overall return profile. I mean we have seen it already, I think, improved where it was, where I think it was single-digits there for a while. If you were lucky, it was high single-digits, where I think you're now seeing sort of full return yields and levered returns even above that. And for us, given that we get some advantages in the structure associated with fee streams, et cetera, I think -- and it's still an attractive equity return profile for us. And so I think that -- but I think those returns have gone up where you're seeing cash-on-cash yields that are meaningfully higher, meaningful up into the double-digits and much more attractive now. So, I do think that, that return profile has improved. It's going to continue to be a very competitive business, though. It's -- and one that will have a very return -- a different return profile than retail, which is, again, why we want to preserve our balance sheet firepower to the extent we can to continue to cultivate our retail business, while at the same time, recognizing the strategic importance of continuing to be active in the xScale market. Yes Nick."

With us today are Charles Meyers, Equinix's CEO and President; and Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts.  In the interest of wrapping this call up in 1 hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to one.  At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles. \nCharles Meyers: Thank you, Chip. Good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As reflected in our results, Equinix continues to enjoy momentum in our business as digital transformation accelerates the pace of innovation and changes the way business is done. By 2026, IDC is forecasting that 40% of revenue from G2000 companies will come from digital products, services and experiences, a dynamic that is reshaping the basis of competition in nearly every industry and making digital an unprecedented force for economic growth. These secular drivers, combined with an accelerating appetite for companies to rapidly integrate AI into their operations are driving increased demand for data center capacity as a broad range of service providers extend and scale their global infrastructure to support the clear enterprise commitment to hybrid and multicloud as the IT architecture of choice.  Equinix remains exceptionally well positioned to respond to this demand environment, delivering against the need for infrastructure that is more distributed, more cloud connected, more sustainable and more ecosystem-centric than ever before. Against this backdrop, we had a great second quarter with solid gross and net bookings, very strong pricing dynamics, excellent pipeline conversion and healthy new logo growth. We continue to drive disciplined sales execution at scale with more than 4,100 deals in the quarter across more than 3,100 customers, demonstrating the continued strength of our unmatched go-to-market machine and approach.  Turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q2 were $2.02 billion, up 14% year-over-year driven by strong recurring revenue growth, power price increases and timing of xScale fees. Adjusted EBITDA was up 7% year-over-year, and AFFO was again better than our expectations due to strong operating performance. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. With customers deployed in all three regions now representing approximately 2/3 of our recurring revenues, we continue to invest behind the scale and reach of our data center services portfolio. We now have 53 major projects underway across 40 metros in 24 countries, including 11 xScale builds that we expect will deliver approximately 90 megawatts of capacity once opened.  This quarter, we added 12 new projects, including new data center builds in Lisbon, Monterrey, Mumbai and our first build in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Over the past several years, we have seen Malaysia emerge as an increasingly important location for digital infrastructure. By expanding Platform Equinix in Johor and Kuala Lumpur, the two most strategic markets in Malaysia, we will enable local and global businesses to leverage our trusted platform to bring together and interconnect the foundational digital infrastructure that will power their success. Additionally, we are delighted with the recently announced results of Singapore's data center call for application, where Equinix was one of a very limited set of participants selected to build incremental data center capacity in the critical Singaporean market.  Equinix is honored to have this opportunity to strengthen Singapore's digital capabilities, delivering sustainable infrastructure that will fuel the economy, cultivate critical ecosystems and aligned to Singapore's green plan. Multi-region customer wins this quarter included Cogent Communications, a U.S. multinational ISP using Equinix's robust ecosystem and interconnection platform to optimize and enhance their global services and Apcela a provider of software-defined cloud-optimized networks for digitally transforming global enterprises as they leverage Equinix Fabric and other digital services for low-latency network and cloud connectivity.  Our global interconnection franchise continues to thrive with over 456,000 total interconnections on our platform. In Q2, interconnection revenue stepped up 11% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, driven by healthy pricing, increasing traffic levels and strong gross adds. Net interconnection adds remain on the lower side at 4,100 due to continued grooming activity and consolidation into higher bandwidth connections, but the number of unique interconnection relationships across our platform continues to expand with over 110,000 unique pairs, reflecting the exceptional value of our scaled digital ecosystems.  Equinix Fabric had another strong quarter with total virtual connections passing 50,000 for the first time and the addition of new capabilities to support data-intensive workloads like AI and cloud migration. Beginning in the third quarter, Fabric customers will be able to provision virtual connections to cloud providers with bandwidth up to 50 gig per second with Google Cloud as the first cloud partner to support this capability. Internet exchange saw strength in our EMEA and APAC markets with peak traffic up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 25% year-over-year to nearly 32 terabits per second.  Key interconnection customer wins this quarter included a gaming and entertainment company, expanding interconnection across all three regions to optimize the gamer experience and PEER 1 a Brazilian telco leveraging Platform Equinix to establish its digital presence through network hubs, beginning with South America and Miami.  Turning to our xScale portfolio. We continue to see strong overall demand as cloud adoption remains a driving force in digital transformation. In Q2, we leased 10 megawatts of capacity in our Osaka 2 asset with cumulative xScale leasing now over 200 megawatts globally, and we have a strong funnel of additional scale opportunities for the back half of the year. We also won three new native cloud on-ramps this quarter in Bogot\u00e1, Madrid and Toronto, further strengthening our cloud ecosystem, which represents nearly 15% of total interconnection on our platform. Key enterprise to cloud ecosystem wins this quarter, including one of the largest auto insurers in the U.S., continuing to expand interconnections on our platform to optimize its networks and multi-cloud connectivity and a leading European automotive company deploying at Equinix to support reliable and scalable connectivity to the cloud worldwide.  As businesses increasingly look to consume their digital infrastructure at software speed, we're continuing to enhance our platform strategy and expand our partnerships. In Q2, we announced our expanded partnership with Hewlett Packard Enterprise for pre-provisioned HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise and HPE GreenLake for private cloud business addition, both available on demand at select Equinix IBX data centers. These new offerings in 7 metros around the globe will help businesses expand their hybrid multi-cloud strategies, while providing greater agility, control and predictability of workload costs and data. Additional key digital services wins this quarter included Bionexo to Brazil, a health tech company that offers digital solutions for managing health care processes, using fabric and network edge for seamless connections with partners and customers, while reducing complexity and cost. Telna, a global mobile network infrastructure provider using Platform Equinix to facilitate its marketplace for cellular connectivity among its customers. Our Channel program delivered another strong quarter, accounting for 40% of bookings and nearly 60% of new logos.  We continue to see growth from partners like Accenture, Avant, Dell, Cisco and HPE with wins across a wide range of industry verticals and digital use cases. Key wins this quarter included partnering with Kyndryl to support a large American health insurance provider with their network and application modernization efforts, featuring the deployment of cloud adjacent infrastructure and interconnection to the health care ecosystem.  Now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. \nKeith Taylor: Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you're all doing well and enjoying the summer months. I must say it was great to be back in New York City spending time with many of you at our June Analyst Day in person. As you might have guessed, we were excited to share with you our views on the expanding market opportunity. Our continued ability to manage through this dynamic and complex global environment, while working to maximize the value of our business. And perhaps, most importantly, share our thoughts on how we believe we can deliver durable shareholder value. Now as you can see from our Q2 earnings report, we again delivered solid results, while addressing many of the complexities affecting our business. We had solid gross and net bookings and positive pricing dynamics reflecting the continued momentum we see in the market. Overall, we continue to focus on driving a higher yield on both our new and existing investments.  On a constant currency basis, including our net positive pricing actions, Global MRR per cabinet was up $39 quarter-over-quarter to $2,156 per cabinet. Now given the tight supply environment across many of our metros and the high utilization levels across our portfolio, we remain very focused on our strategy of putting the right customer with the right application into the right IBX. Also, we're being particularly selective at backfilling space in certain constrained markets, focusing on high price points and increased power densities. As a result, the timing of these deployments may create some fluctuations in our quarterly net cabinet billing metric, an outcome we're actively managing across all three regions. This is positively offset by strong stabilized asset growth, higher MRR per cabinet and better returns on our invested capital.  Turning to some of the macro factors affecting our business. We remain pleased with how the organization has mitigated the impacts of energy price volatility across our business and with our customers. Concessions and distributes remain low and our cash collections are in line with historical trends. As it relates to our foreign operating currencies, we continue to hedge where appropriate to dampen the volatility attributed to the actions of many central banks to adjust interest rates. Also, we made some modest FX to our 2023 outlook, largely attributable to the recent devaluation of the Nigerian naira and the weaker Japanese yen, two of the currencies that we do not hedge.  Now let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Note that all comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q2 revenues were $2.018 billion, up 14% over the same quarter last year due to strong recurring revenues, power price increases and the timing of xScale nonrecurring fees. As we've noted before, nonrecurring revenues, particularly those attributable to our xScale business and certain custom installation works are inherently lumpy. Hence, NRR was down quarter-over-quarter as planned. But given our significant scale pipeline, we expect to see a meaningful step-up in NRR in the second half of the year. Q2 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $3 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates.  Global Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $901 million or 45% of revenues, up 7% over the same quarter last year due to strong operating performance, including an $11 million one-off software expense related to our Americas managed services business and higher variable salaries and benefit costs. Also, Q2 saw certain EMEA energy contracts reset at higher average rates resulting in increased net utility costs as forecasted. Q2 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges included a $2 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance range and $3 million of integration costs.  Global Q2 AFFO was $754 million, above our expectation due to strong business performance and lower net interest expense. Q2 AFFO included a $1 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance range. Global Q2 MRR churn was 2.3%. For the full year, we continue to expect MRR churn to average at the lower half of our 2% to 2.5% quarterly guidance range.  Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized and constant currency basis, EMEA and APAC were our fastest-growing regions at 21% and 16%, respectively. Although when excluding the impact of the benefit attributed to the power price increases, EMEA and APAC region growth rates were 8% and 11%, respectively, while the Americas region grew 7% year-over-year. The Americas region had another solid quarter with continued strong pricing trends, solid momentum from our channel and public sector teams and healthy exports across the global platform. We had strong activity in Boston, Chicago and Culpeper metros and the Canadian business.  Our EMEA business delivered a solid quarter with firm pricing, continued lower churn and a healthy step-up in deal volume. Revenue was down slightly due to the timing of large NRR deals between quarters. We had strength come from our Amsterdam, Dublin and Frankfurt metros, while booking a substantial space and power deal in Lagos, Nigeria with a large multinational energy company, highlighting the momentum across our platform, including our MainOne assets. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a strong quarter with record net bookings and firm deal pricing as well as strong imports to our Mumbai, Osaka and Singapore markets. And as evidenced by the number of new expansions, Chennai, Jakarta, Johor, Kuala Lumpur, customer interest in expanding their footprint into new Asian markets is high, and we're investing behind this demand.  And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our balance sheet increased slightly to approximately $31.6 billion, including an unrestricted cash balance of over $2.3 billion. As expected, our cash balance decreased slightly quarter-over-quarter due to our investment in growth CapEx and a quarterly cash dividend, offset by our strong operating cash flows. Our net leverage remains low at 3.6x our annualized adjusted EBITDA. And as mentioned previously, we plan to opportunistically raise additional debt capital and reduce rate environments where we currently operate. This will create both incremental debt capital to fund our growth and placed a natural hedge into these markets.  Additionally, during the quarter, we executed about $200 million of ATM forward sale transactions, which will be settled in early 2024 to help fund our 2024 growth plans alongside our other sources of capital.  Turning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $638 million, including a recurring CapEx of $40 million. Since our last earnings call, we opened 7 retail projects across both the Americas and EMEA regions and two xScale projects in Frankfurt and Tokyo. Revenue from owned assets increased to 64% of our recurring revenues for the quarter. We expect this trend to continue with over 85% of our expansion CapEx spend on owned or long-term ground lease properties, including 100% of our 16 bills in the Americas.  Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our now 174 stabilized assets increased revenues by 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Taking out the benefit attributed to the power price increases, stabilized assets increased 7% year-over-year. Our stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested.  And finally, please to refer to Slides 11 through 15 for our updated summary of 2023 guidance and bridges. Do not all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. For the full year 2023, we're maintaining our underlying revenue outlook with expected top line growth of 14% to 15% or 9% to 10%, excluding the impact of power cost pass-through to our customers, a reflection of our continued strong execution. We're raising our underlying 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $20 million, primarily due to favorable operating costs and lower integration spend. And we're raising our underlying AFFO guidance by $28 million to now grow between 11% and 14% compared to the previous year. AFFO per share is now expected to grow between 9% and 11%.  CapEx is expected to range between $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, including approximately $120 million of on balance sheet xScale spend, which we expect to be reimbursed as we transfer assets into the JV later this year or early next year and about $220 million of recurring CapEx spend.  So let me stop here, and I'll turn the call back to Charles. \nCharles Meyers: Thanks, Keith. In closing, we had a strong first half of the year and continue to see a robust demand environment as key secular drivers positively influence buying behavior even in the face of a challenging macro climate. The relevance of Platform Equinix continues to grow as service providers scale out their global infrastructure in response to growing enterprise demand for hybrid and multi-cloud as the architecture of choice and the associated need for hybrid infrastructure to deliver performance, agility, scalability and sustainability. In this context, we believe Equinix remains uniquely positioned and highly differentiated and will continue to drive disciplined execution of our strategy with a focus on extending our market leadership, driving operating leverage, expanding our platform capabilities to fuel sustained growth and delivering superior returns on capital, all of which we are confident will translate to distinctive and durable value for our customers, and sustained performance for you, our investors, with a keen focus on AFFO per share as our lighthouse metric.  So let me stop there and open it up for questions. \nOperator: Our first question comes from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. \nAri Klein: Maybe on the AI front and as it relates to xScale, there are some exceptionally large leases being done with the vast majority of those in the U.S. where xScale doesn't have a presence. How are you thinking about potentially entering the market capture some of that demand? \nCharles Meyers : Yes. We've talked about this in a few different forms. I do think that our posture has probably evolved a little bit in terms of our thinking around xScale in the Americas broadly and in the U.S. specifically. And I think AI is part of that. And so it's not the only factor, but I do think we had already been thinking about certain markets where we believe that -- what we see, as I said around the world, is that the markets where we have the full portfolio xScale retail digital services at scale, really perform best. I mean you can argue a little bit of whether it's chicken or egg there in terms of what's driving what. But it's -- what we do see is that when we have the full portfolio, we're able to address a broader set of customer demands. And so I think as we looked at that, we do think that there are markets in the U.S. that we would like to have an xScale presence. And so we're -- I think we're looking at how we would do that and potentially through a combination of organic and potentially inorganic pursuits.  So I do think that AI is a part of that, but really only a part. And I think that the continued demand for cloud services and the commitment to cloud adoption, I think, continues at pace with the enterprise, all of that driving really a strong pipeline across the world and it does lead us to believe that thinking about how to solve for xScale in Americas is something that is on our mind. \nAri Klein : And then just the Americas and EMEA saw cabinet decline. It sounds like maybe there was some timing and churn potentially there. Can you provide some color on some of the moving pieces? And maybe give us a sense of the size of the backlog? \nCharles Meyers : Sure. Yes. I mean I'd start with the backlog question and tell you that backlog continues to be very healthy. We do see -- as we've said over the years, billable cabs can really be a pretty volatile metric, and it can swing meaningfully both due to timing of installs and therefore, backlog and in particular, churn activity. Undoubtedly, we recognize that billable cab has to grow over time to fuel the business. But we do see short-term fluctuations in that metric as we really optimize the platform. So if you look at it, as you noted, we've always encouraged people to really look at rolling forward quarter averages because of that volatility.  If you look at Americas running about 90%, the rolling four quarter is about 90% of what it's been for the last three years, typically. EMEA is actually -- its rolling fourth quarter average is actually meaningfully ahead of what the three-year average is and APAC is lower with three consecutive quarters of really lower cab adds, but it's a bit of a unique dynamic in APAC related to some of the capacity constraints in Asia particularly Singapore, which is why we are so excited to have been able to announce the allocation of capacity to Equinix in the Singaporean market. So we -- I think that we're comfortable there. There is some churn activity that I think is in the markets and some backlog that I think is going to roll through.  And so I think we'll -- when we look at that on a rolling four-quarter basis, I think we'll see those things normalize a bit. But let me -- and we knew this would be a kind of issue. So I want to maybe give you a little more concrete insight into the billable caps. If you look at it specifically on the churn side, over the past 5 quarters, we've had about 7 deployments of meaningful size churn. And 85% of that total cab volume coming from those churns are what we would consider favorable churn.  Basically, cabs that are in constrained markets where we really welcome the additional capacity and consolidate a very positive mark-to-market. And given the trajectory right now that we're seeing in the market on pricing, on power density, on interconnection, and as we refill those cabs at prevailing prices and power densities, we actually expect uplifts on those three -- about the -- 85% of those cabs in the 50% to 70% MRR uplift range. So that's just a reflection of kind of the kinds of actions that we're taking to optimize the platform that have impacts on billable cabs but really positive impacts and upside in terms of we look at it, and we believe we're going to get millions of dollars of extra MRR by sort of turning those cabinets over or tens of millions on an annual basis with zero CapEx.  And so that's some of the dynamic that you're seeing there, and I think it will move around a bit as we identify that. Now there's not that many of those out there. And so that's -- but that is a dynamic that is -- has impacted the billable cabs a bit over the last couple of quarters. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. \nMichael Rollins : Curious if you can unpack a bit more of the stabilized constant currency growth without the power price increases that I think was set at 7% year-over-year. in the quarter? And as you look at the opportunities that you were just describing in terms of re-leasing opportunities and the current environment, what's your -- is there an updated view of what stabilized organic growth should look like for Equinix over the next few years? \nCharles Meyers : Yes. It's a good question, Mike. I do think that we had guided to a range lower than certainly that 7% that we're seeing, absent the PPIs Obviously, PPIs are having a major impact there and reflected in as reported at 10%, but I think that's not really a valid number because that will bounce around a little bit, and we'll based on what's happening with power pricing. But I do think that 7%, obviously, is a very attractive level. I do think that we're seeing that pricing right now is very firm. We are raising -- we've raised prices on our underlying colo products and on interconnection meaningfully and continue to see strong demand and stable churn. And so I think that's going to be a positive factor.  The other one that I just mentioned in the previous conversation, a little bit about billable cabs is power densities. Power densities are definitely on the rise. And so some of the churn activity that I just talked about there, those 37 deployments were -- many of them are in stabilized assets. And so you're going to see uplift there as you turn some of that over. So long answer or non-answer to your question in terms of what is the right range, obviously, I think we have been talking about 3 to 5, 7 is obviously nicely above that. I would certainly hope that -- I do think the current dynamic of pricing in the market is a major driver. And so we'll just track that and see how we -- but obviously, we love being above that guided top end. And if we feel like that's a sustained trajectory, we'll come back and look at that. \nMichael Rollins : And if I could just follow up with one other. You mentioned the variability of the power side of the equation. And as you're looking at the pricing environment for power specifically, any updates of how power pricing and power revenues and those surcharges might look for 2024? \nCharles Meyers : Yes. I figured that might come up, too, Mike. So the -- what I'd say is that we are -- obviously, we're just a little over halfway through the year. We've been hedging into our positions. And in some markets, hedging in at rates that are below where we had been previously, and in some cases, a bit somewhat materially below that. Obviously, we still have a significant portion of our hedging positions yet to fill. And there's a lot of the year left. And so it's impossible, I think, for us to predict exactly what will happen. So I don't want to be too concrete on this matter. But I would think that there might be some markets if current course continues, where we will hedge into a rate '24 that is below what it was in '23.  And as we said to our customers, and I think as we've communicated to our customers, they really sort of embraced and understood the benefits that our hedging program provides -- and we've told them if that is to -- would occur, we would pass that through to you as well. And so I think how many markets that might occur in, not sure. But as we said when we provided the guide and when we provided at Analyst Day and in other forums, said, look, we're -- this sort of assumes nothing relative to power price increases or decreases, and we'll adjust that accordingly or sort of normalize it out because what's really important from our perspective is the underlying performance of the business. And while we do recognize that power price, for example, has some impact on the optics margin. I think it really isn't an underlying fundamental sort of impact on the business.  And so we'll let you know. A shorter answer would be, I do think that we may see some markets in which we would see a PD or a price decrease next year and others that we would see it flat and perhaps others would see it go up. But still more work to do in terms of hedging into our positions, and we'll keep you updated as we know more. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jon Atkin with RBC. \nJonathan Atkin : Yes, a couple of questions. I was curious just about decision time frames by customers closing rates, book-to-bill, that sort of thing? And then if you look at stabilized gross margins, it looks like that was down and I forgot if you might have mentioned this earlier, but why the pressure on stabilized gross margins? \nCharles Meyers : Yes. I'll let Keith tackle the second one. I'll give you the first one, I'll give you a little color on the quarter. Really solid quarter from a bookings perspective. And I think we saw even though I think there are some customers who continue to be cautious in the overall environment. What we saw in Q1, as we told you, we saw a little more deal slippage from Q1 into Q2, but we had said that close rates were pretty consistent. In Q2, we saw the same thing that actually very good pipeline conversion, and we saw sales cycles not really extended very much in line with our historical norms. And we saw the push rate from quarter-to-quarter actually come -- bounced back to where it had been previously.  So I would say overall, a very solid quarter. I do think the dynamic that we described previously, which is some customers just being cautious about how much capacity they're buying, obviously, negotiating hard, which is a norm for us those kind of dynamics. And then in some cases, going back and if they have more capacity than they need coming back and having a dialogue with us about whether we want to take some of that back. And as I said, that is a bit of the dynamic coloring some of our -- because we see opportunities but look very favorable for us to do that. We'll take advantage of and that's some of what's impacting the billable cabs numbers.  So overall, though, I would say, I feel good about the quarter from a sales execution standpoint and from an overall customer sentiment standpoint and also feel good about where we are in terms of overall funnel for the second half of the year. So obviously, we have a big hill to climb every quarter in terms of a lot of deals. 4,100 deals in a quarter, you got to do a lot of selling, but our team, I think, had a really strong Q2 and our -- and based on my customer visits and time with the sales teams, I think there's a lot of optimism for the second half of the year. \nKeith Taylor: Jon, relating to the second part of the question, just no surprise. You've seen that you'll see the sort of the margin erosion across a number of the key metrics, whether it's on a total basis, whether it's in Europe or whether it's in the stabilized assets, it's primarily related to the reset of the of the energy contracts. As you look at the first quarter, we had the benefit, if you will, of contracts -- the power contracts where they were. But as they reset, was there was a meaningful step up in the second quarter, and that was felt throughout a number of our core metrics.  And as they look forward, most of that is now going to stabilize, which is the good part. And that was all factored into the pricing sort of structure that we had when we started the year. We anticipated what the price points were going to be on an average basis, and that was the rate at which we pass through to our customers. \nJonathan Atkin : And then lastly, I wonder if you're seeing any tailwinds in segments of your cost connect business that you would attribute to AI given that you might expect a little bit of an uptick in connectivity requirements as these training models get spun up. Are you seeing that at all or not? \nCharles Meyers : We've seen specific instances of interconnect to support AI. In fact, we had a pretty significant win this quarter in the AI realm with an AI-as-a-service provider that really put their core network nodes with us to really drive interconnection to the multi-cloud connectivity and really to support the inference and interconnection to the cloud. And so we did see that -- I wouldn't say that's likely shown up. In fact, that hasn't shown up in our results yet because we just booked a deal. But I think that's indicative of some of what's going on there, it's probably a little tough to tell.  Interestingly, on interconnect, Jon, what I would say is that we've seen really strong gross add activity, and it's really in line with our nine quarter averages. And so that's, I think, a really encouraging sign. And in fact, interconnect to cloud at the end is up meaningfully year-over-year. It was moderated a little by the financial ecosystem, which was a little down year-over-year in terms of gross adds, but we're very stable on the Intersect side in terms of gross adds. And so -- and I'm sure that some of that is attributable to AI.  And then -- but then on the churn side, we are seeing a little bit more -- you're also seeing a little more churn activity with cloud as a VM, but more between service provider types, cloud to cloud, cloud to network, et cetera. And so -- and that's, I think, a lot of grooming, a lot of 10 to 100 migration and some M&A activity. So I gave you a little more there than you were looking for on interconnect. But I do think that we're -- you're going to see a lot of data transfer happening. And I think we're just really well positioned on that in terms of our multi-cloud connectivity and the sort of more advanced nature of fabric in terms of being more agile to that demand over time.  So we're excited about that opportunity, and that certainly is coming up a lot out there in the market is as people are talking about it. And really, I think more -- a lot on the service provider side, but also enterprise is really talking about the things they're doing to bring AI into their operations. \nOperator: And our next question is from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. \nSimon Flannery : You talked about the power density requirements a couple of times. So how are you thinking about that strategically? Are there redesigns or retrofitting you're thinking about doing to your IBXs? And how does that impact the scales that you've built so far and that you might build from here? I know people like Meta have been reconsidering data center design. \nCharles Meyers : Yes. Yes. And we certainly are actively thinking about what our -- the evolution of our design and ensuring that it's evolving and keeping pace with the market. In our retail space, we do have the -- what's really nice about the retail business is when you serve a very broad range of customers with differing density requirements, you're able to sort of dense up and extract more from the system over time. And we've really, I think, benefited from that. When you in more of the hyperscale or xScale type arena it's a little more challenging. I think you have to just be -- because you allocate all that power out typically to a single customer or maybe two in a facility, and it's a little bit different.  And so I do think average density -- design densities are going to need to be going up. I think that also to your ability to cooling is often the constraint. And I think there are -- we are actively looking at, in fact, in our innovation center in D.C., we're actively looking at and testing liquid cooling as a way to get more out of our current designs as well as implement as a more standard feature in our go-forward designs. And so I do think we're going to -- you're going to be seeing design densities going up and you're also going to be seeing us use technologies to augment existing facilities to get more out of them. \nOperator: Our next call is Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. \nEric Luebchow : One for Keith. I think you mentioned the nonrecurring side of the business would see a material step-up in the back half. And so maybe you could provide us a little more color on that. Is that more custom install work, xScale fees, maybe just the right run rate to think about for NRR as we look out the remainder of the year? \nKeith Taylor : Yes. As you can tell from the guidance we delivered and we've said -- Charles has mentioned a few times, the recurring aspect of our business is performing exceedingly well. The nonrecurring, a lot of what you experienced, particularly with the step-ups and the step downs it relates to the xScale fees. As you're wholly aware, there's two nonrecurring xScale fees and there are two recurring xScalev fees. As it relates to the nonrecurring, it's really the sales and marketing fee that has the biggest impact to our business.  So as we said, the pipeline is very deep. There's a lot of opportunity that's right in front of us. And so we anticipate that there will be a very large set of fees that get earned over the second half of the year. Right now, we're targeting that to be in the fourth quarter. I guess there's always a scenario where it could be the third quarter, but it's really -- it's a second half anticipated close. And so with that, that's what we've got in the guidance.  And then on top of that, of course, the recurring part of our business is still -- you're seeing a nice meaningful step-up on that and you just have to go to the midpoint of the guidance over the rest of the year. And you can see that, that one of those quarters is going to be one of the largest step-up you've ever seen in our history. But part of that, of course, is driven from the nonrecurring fees. \nEric Luebchow : Great. And just one follow-up. If I look at churn, it ticked up a little bit to 2.3%. Just wanted to confirm, is that related to some of the volatility you're seeing with cabinet build metrics you mentioned earlier in the call, some of the network grooming on cross-connects? Any way to think about how we should think about churn going forward, still in the lower end of the 2% range? Or will it be a little more variable based on what you said earlier? \nCharles Meyers : Yes. And that's so much related to the interconnection because that does -- on a net basis, probably not having -- not a huge driver on the churn metric. But it is related in part to those deployments that I talked about when I was giving color on the billable cabs that related to churns that we view as favorable. Again, those 37 deployments, the 85% of those cabs are going to have mark-to-market that are in the 50% to 70% positive range. And so that's -- we're take those when we can get them. And so -- and several of those in Singapore. And so we will -- even with our additional allocation, that's out there in the future. in terms of build. And so it's a precious resource to have capacity in the Singaporean market, particularly capacity that has the kind of characteristics that we do in terms of cloud proximity and sort of network density and ability to drive the performance, et cetera.  And so we'll take that capacity. And those are some of the things that led to us seeing a little bit of an uptick there. But as we said in the prepared remarks, we're comfortable that we, on average, for the year, will end in sort of the lower part of our guided range. And you may see a little spikes in there like we did a little bit higher this quarter, but that generally is probably more attributable to favorable type turn activity. \nKeith Taylor : And Eric just maybe just add 1 other thing. As we look forward, and Charles alluded to earlier on, as we think about some of the negotiations we have to get back capacity in some highly constrained assets and markets, part of that is Singapore. And so we are working on 1 thing that clearly we'll identify it if we come to an appropriate negotiated outcome. But suffice to say, those are the examples of things that cause those small blips, but we're going to -- we'll sort of call it out for you. \nOperator: Our next caller is David Barden with Bank of America. \nDavid Barden : I guess Charles, when you look at the kind of the global landscape and you start extrapolating the dynamic that we've started to see in places like Northern Virginia, or Toronto, Mexico City, Southern Valley, how should we, as investors, think about the P versus V equation as power availability kind of constrict V and how do you think about your ability to ramp the P on the price to kind of monetize that scarcity element of the business that you're in? \nCharles Meyers : Yes, there's a lot in that question. On the -- on peak times V or Q or whichever you prefer, it's -- I think we're definitely seeing a firm pricing environment. And I think that's true of the data capacity industry at large. But I think that we see -- we obviously operate in the retail side of the business at a very different price point than the prevailing broader industry, which I think is -- centers more around a wholesale or hyperscale type price point. But both are on the rise, and I think that's going to continue to be the case for a bit of time here. I think in terms of volumes, I think volumes are also going to grow.  The question of whether or not power availability would constrain supply is an interesting question. I think that it could in market by market, but I think that -- on our side, we feel very comfortable that our relationships and our visibility to power allocations are going to allow us to continue to execute on the build plan that we have in place.  On the xScale side, I think it's a little more challenging, but we are actively working with the folks to make sure the identity that. And we're also actively looking at alternatives. And for example, things like on-site power generation, I think, are probably more of a reality in some of those -- in that market over time. So done that in certain markets. In fact, our recent Dublin facility has on-site power generation with fuel cells, natural gas-based fuel cells as a primary source of power. We actually use Bloom Energy fuel cells in Silicon Valley, not as a primary source but as a -- but I think that's -- I think we're going to continue to see trends in that area.  So I don't -- and I also think that you're going to see that if necessary, the positioning of certain forms of data center capacity, particularly in the hyperscale area and some of AI training may adapt to simply go where the power is. And so I think that you may see some of that movement as well. So I don't think quantity is going to be material constrained -- materially constrained in our retail business by power availability, but it is something that I think we, as an industry, need to continue to grapple with. \nDavid Barden : And as a follow-up to that, specifically to that point about going to where the power is, do you see a shift in your CapEx allocation into kind of, let's just call it, more novel land bank development opportunities? Obviously, we've seen reports that Meta, for instance, is looking to do a gigawatt in Wisconsin or other places like this that would not tend to be in the traditional geography of data centers? \nCharles Meyers : Yes. Short answer is not yet. And in fact, obviously, the vast majority of our demand and our revenue and our profitability is sourced from sort of our large campus environments around the world, and that's where bulk of our land has been. You're seeing the rise in our sort of owned asset revenue because we're continuing to build now on owned land and owned facilities around the world. And so the bulk of our land bank is really still going towards that. That doesn't mean we'd necessarily be opposed to that. I think that would more likely be xScale type thing, which would probably run through the -- but I do think those are the kinds of things that we have to be thinking about.  I do think in terms of more -- some of our xScale though, I think, is going to be more approximate to our campus locations in those areas where we think we can support that. But I don't think it's out of the question we do that. But right now, the shorter answer to the question is no, that's not really yet part of our equation. \nKeith Taylor : David, I just probably note just on the number of projects that we have underway across 40 markets today. Again, we're in we're actually spreading our capital far and wide to capture the opportunity in most of the sort of the major centers around the globe. And as a result, that's going to be, I think, more of the emphasis going forward, smaller byte sizes that make sense, and particularly those ones that are adjacent or contiguous with their existing facilities. And that's just what you're seeing. And then you heard us talk a little bit about, at least in the prepared remarks, the new markets that we're sort of entering into.  And so we'll continue to push our advantages in our -- in the markets that we have today, but also go to markets where others are less likely to go and we get to enjoy the sort of the experiences of the retail business versus just focusing on hyperscale. \nOperator: Our next caller is Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. \nBrett Feldman : Keith, I want to come back to some of the comments you made in your prepared remarks about dealing with some stresses in the supply chain. Obviously, you've been grappling with that to some degree for a number of years now. I'm just curious how broad-based is it? Is it concentrated in the market? Is it around certain elements that go into development? And then just to clarify, is that distinct to the quite literal physical supply chain? Or were you embedding within that challenges associated with power procurement improvement? \nKeith Taylor : Yes, Brett, just generally speaking, given the demand for data centers and all things surrounded, to that industry. The supply chains continue to be constricted. And I think even at the Analyst Day, Charles made a reference to the fact that generator 3-megawatt generated today has roughly 120-week time line. So it gives you a sense of how far out you have to start thinking and planning. And so one of the things that we tried to emphasize at the Analyst Day was we look at look at all our markets, all of the projects and determine exactly what we need where and then we have a very sophisticated procurement team that focuses on making sure we work with the larger providers and get availability either to production capacity or a slot in the production line or available capacity from the inventories. .  And I just think that's something that we prudently do. We manage ourselves, and it's something that's going to be very important on a look-forward basis as well. And you have to tie that back into the comments Charles made about power. Demand, you have to have the available power, you have the available cooling and making sure that you have the appropriate kit to roll out the data centers in a fair way that you can deliver the capacity to the need. And again, a lot of work is done on that.  The team -- the construction -- the design, construction, procurement sourcing teams are all working together in tandem, and we look out 5 years. And in some cases, as I said, we'll go out as far as 10 or 15 years like the London market where we see a broad future opportunity as well. \nCharles Meyers : Yes. Brett, I'd add that I do think that one thing I did mention previously I'll put in there now is that I think one of the really critical factors in ensuring availability for what is inevitably going to be a somewhat constrained resource on power in places around the world is to bring forward really thoughtful approach to sustainability. So -- and that was one of the driving forces, I believe, in terms of our successfully getting an allocation in Singapore. And so similarly, I think our ability to work closely with -- and I've been on the phone with utility CEOs in the recent past talking about these topics in terms of how to put our heads together and try to for some of these things and sustainability has to be, I think, part of that picture.  And so I do think that that's something we're going to bring to the table. We're going to lean in and really continue our market-leading emphasis on sustainability, not only for our customers but in tandem with our partners on the utility side as well. And so I think those are other factors that I think come into play when we really think about the power issue. \nOperator: Our next caller is Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. \nMatt Niknam : Just a couple of like housekeeping ones for me. First, if you can comment on what drove the slight increase? I think it was about $10 million increase of recurring CapEx. And then also, I noticed DSO stepped up somewhat modestly. I think accounts receivable is about a headwind of $100 million in the quarter. Just wondering if there's anything that you'd call out beyond typical 2Q seasonality? \nKeith Taylor : Yes. On the first one, just recurring CapEx is when you look at it year-over-year, Q2 tends to be -- Q1 is our lowest spend on a seasonal basis, Q2 we're sort of right on line with where we thought would be 2% and that was consistent with last year. And then you see over the next two quarters, we step it up even further. So part of it is just timing and making sure we do the work that we need to, based on the needs inside the different buildings. And as a result, it'll move around by quarter, but we can sort of massage at times into different quarters. But I would just say nothing meaningfully has caused that. It was an $18 million step up quarter-over-quarter just to be exact about it.  As it relates to DSOs, as I said in the prepared remarks, our DSOs, our recovery has gone up a little bit. But what I would tell you is some of the things that we've been working on with our customers, as you can appreciate, I said there's not -- there's certainly some discussion around the power price increases. And although we're ahead of what we anticipated, there's still some negotiations. And as a result, our DSOs had moved up a bit. Customers weren't -- some of the customers weren't paying their entire bill instead of just disputing what the power price increase was, the whole bill was being held back. And some of those have since been made in the July time frame. And so DSO, I think you're going to see that step back down to a more traditional level.  But overall, I'd just say you've got liquidity in the business, the cash we're generating and the collections you'll get some seasonality. We're running ahead of what we anticipated we'd be for the third quarter already. And as I said, I think DSO is an average days delinquent will go down. \nMatt Niknam : Keith, just to clarify, it was more on the guide for recurring CapEx. I think that stepped up $10 million relative to the prior guide for the year. So I was just wondering if there's anything notable to be aware of there? \nKeith Taylor : I'm sorry, I misunderstood your question then. As it relates No, there's a little bit more recurring CapEx when we have capacity and we look across the portfolio and think what can we do based on the capacities we have. And so sometimes when we work with Rob Abdel's organization said, we have capacity to put a little bit more recurring CapEx into the year. And so what you could do is pull it forward from one year and put it into the year prior. And so that's what you've just seen. We have -- we felt we had a little bit more capacity to invest in some recurring CapEx this year. That really takes away that obligation for next year. \nOperator: Our last question comes from Nick Del Deo with Moffat Nathanson. \nNick Del Deo : Charles, on the interconnection front, are you still expecting an improvement in adds as we move through the year like you communicated previously? Or do you think these headwinds are a bit softer than expected? \nCharles Meyers : Yes. Great question, Nick. I'd tell you, in all honesty, I had expected we would have seen a bit of a moderation back up towards prior levels. now. But there's a lot of factors in play there. I think that the short answer is I do believe we're going to see that because when I look at it, the gross adds continue to be really strong. So overall demand for interconnection persistent. And as I said, even growing with cloud as the end.  And so I think that, that is the most encouraging to me. When we really unpack what is suppressed the net adds, it's clearly on the churn side. And so we've unpacked that in great depth, as you might imagine. And it really is almost all from the service provider side in terms of where we're seeing the elevated churn over normal levels. And as we unpack it further, you see there is definitely 10 to 100 migration. And I think that has accelerated a bit more than we expected just because -- and maybe we should have anticipated this, but as the cost of electronics goes down, it is more broadly available to people who have a sufficient number of interconnects to really justify that.  And so we did see continued uptick. And so it seems almost like what you're seeing is 10 to 100 migration was led by the most sophisticated customers with the most at stake -- and then you see another blip as sort of the broader population begins to sort of integrate that. But again, it's not going to be relevant for everybody. You have to have some level of concentration to routes to really make it an economically viable proposition. So you're seeing 10 to 100 partially impacted there. Then you saw -- you see some M&A activity. And that's true in the CDN space and in the network space. Those are finite things. They work their way through, and then you go back to some sort of a normal.  And then I would say the third area is just a more aggressive inventory management, particularly from the network space, where as you -- many of you know better than we do, there's some real overall business challenges where people are looking to aggressively tighten their belt in any way they can. And so I think those dynamics -- several of those dynamics are finite in nature, and which is why I kind of fully had expected that we would return. And I don't know whether we get all the way back to our previously guided range, but I think we'll see -- potentially see some lift back there. Independent of all that, even at our current level of ads, we're seeing -- one, we're seeing very strong pricing and that is driving -- and we're seeing a migration towards higher port speeds on offerings that are priced by speed. And so that mix is helping.  And as a result, I think you're going to continue to see very healthy revenue growth. So we'll track that. It's certainly my hope that we will see some elevation through the back half of the year, but we'll just have to see how that plays out. \nNick Del Deo : Okay. Okay. Great. And then in Singapore, obviously, great to see the 20-megawatt allocation you got. How long before you can actually bring that online? And then about how long will 20 megawatts last you? \nCharles Meyers : Well, we can't speak to the actual size of the allocation. So I don't doubt there is information out there, but I can't confirm or deny anything relative to the size of the allegation. I would simply say that -- we're very excited about what we got. We're very excited about the opportunity to build incremental capacity in that market. And we believe it will give us some really solid runway in an incredibly important market. In the meantime, we're continuing to sort of very opportunistically harvest capacity to continue to meet the demands of our customers and to drive very superior returns in that market. \nChip Newcom : Thank you, everyone. This concludes our Q2 earnings call. \nOperator: And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Keith Taylor",
            "content": "Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you're all doing well and enjoying the summer months. I must say it was great to be back in New York City spending time with many of you at our June Analyst Day in person. As you might have guessed, we were excited to share with you our views on the expanding market opportunity. Our continued ability to manage through this dynamic and complex global environment, while working to maximize the value of our business. And perhaps, most importantly, share our thoughts on how we believe we can deliver durable shareholder value. Now as you can see from our Q2 earnings report, we again delivered solid results, while addressing many of the complexities affecting our business. We had solid gross and net bookings and positive pricing dynamics reflecting the continued momentum we see in the market. Overall, we continue to focus on driving a higher yield on both our new and existing investments.  On a constant currency basis, including our net positive pricing actions, Global MRR per cabinet was up $39 quarter-over-quarter to $2,156 per cabinet. Now given the tight supply environment across many of our metros and the high utilization levels across our portfolio, we remain very focused on our strategy of putting the right customer with the right application into the right IBX. Also, we're being particularly selective at backfilling space in certain constrained markets, focusing on high price points and increased power densities. As a result, the timing of these deployments may create some fluctuations in our quarterly net cabinet billing metric, an outcome we're actively managing across all three regions. This is positively offset by strong stabilized asset growth, higher MRR per cabinet and better returns on our invested capital.  Turning to some of the macro factors affecting our business. We remain pleased with how the organization has mitigated the impacts of energy price volatility across our business and with our customers. Concessions and distributes remain low and our cash collections are in line with historical trends. As it relates to our foreign operating currencies, we continue to hedge where appropriate to dampen the volatility attributed to the actions of many central banks to adjust interest rates. Also, we made some modest FX to our 2023 outlook, largely attributable to the recent devaluation of the Nigerian naira and the weaker Japanese yen, two of the currencies that we do not hedge.  Now let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Note that all comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, global Q2 revenues were $2.018 billion, up 14% over the same quarter last year due to strong recurring revenues, power price increases and the timing of xScale nonrecurring fees. As we've noted before, nonrecurring revenues, particularly those attributable to our xScale business and certain custom installation works are inherently lumpy. Hence, NRR was down quarter-over-quarter as planned. But given our significant scale pipeline, we expect to see a meaningful step-up in NRR in the second half of the year. Q2 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $3 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates.  Global Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $901 million or 45% of revenues, up 7% over the same quarter last year due to strong operating performance, including an $11 million one-off software expense related to our Americas managed services business and higher variable salaries and benefit costs. Also, Q2 saw certain EMEA energy contracts reset at higher average rates resulting in increased net utility costs as forecasted. Q2 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges included a $2 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance range and $3 million of integration costs.  Global Q2 AFFO was $754 million, above our expectation due to strong business performance and lower net interest expense. Q2 AFFO included a $1 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance range. Global Q2 MRR churn was 2.3%. For the full year, we continue to expect MRR churn to average at the lower half of our 2% to 2.5% quarterly guidance range.  Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized and constant currency basis, EMEA and APAC were our fastest-growing regions at 21% and 16%, respectively. Although when excluding the impact of the benefit attributed to the power price increases, EMEA and APAC region growth rates were 8% and 11%, respectively, while the Americas region grew 7% year-over-year. The Americas region had another solid quarter with continued strong pricing trends, solid momentum from our channel and public sector teams and healthy exports across the global platform. We had strong activity in Boston, Chicago and Culpeper metros and the Canadian business.  Our EMEA business delivered a solid quarter with firm pricing, continued lower churn and a healthy step-up in deal volume. Revenue was down slightly due to the timing of large NRR deals between quarters. We had strength come from our Amsterdam, Dublin and Frankfurt metros, while booking a substantial space and power deal in Lagos, Nigeria with a large multinational energy company, highlighting the momentum across our platform, including our MainOne assets. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a strong quarter with record net bookings and firm deal pricing as well as strong imports to our Mumbai, Osaka and Singapore markets. And as evidenced by the number of new expansions, Chennai, Jakarta, Johor, Kuala Lumpur, customer interest in expanding their footprint into new Asian markets is high, and we're investing behind this demand.  And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our balance sheet increased slightly to approximately $31.6 billion, including an unrestricted cash balance of over $2.3 billion. As expected, our cash balance decreased slightly quarter-over-quarter due to our investment in growth CapEx and a quarterly cash dividend, offset by our strong operating cash flows. Our net leverage remains low at 3.6x our annualized adjusted EBITDA. And as mentioned previously, we plan to opportunistically raise additional debt capital and reduce rate environments where we currently operate. This will create both incremental debt capital to fund our growth and placed a natural hedge into these markets.  Additionally, during the quarter, we executed about $200 million of ATM forward sale transactions, which will be settled in early 2024 to help fund our 2024 growth plans alongside our other sources of capital.  Turning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $638 million, including a recurring CapEx of $40 million. Since our last earnings call, we opened 7 retail projects across both the Americas and EMEA regions and two xScale projects in Frankfurt and Tokyo. Revenue from owned assets increased to 64% of our recurring revenues for the quarter. We expect this trend to continue with over 85% of our expansion CapEx spend on owned or long-term ground lease properties, including 100% of our 16 bills in the Americas.  Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. Our now 174 stabilized assets increased revenues by 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Taking out the benefit attributed to the power price increases, stabilized assets increased 7% year-over-year. Our stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested.  And finally, please to refer to Slides 11 through 15 for our updated summary of 2023 guidance and bridges. Do not all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. For the full year 2023, we're maintaining our underlying revenue outlook with expected top line growth of 14% to 15% or 9% to 10%, excluding the impact of power cost pass-through to our customers, a reflection of our continued strong execution. We're raising our underlying 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $20 million, primarily due to favorable operating costs and lower integration spend. And we're raising our underlying AFFO guidance by $28 million to now grow between 11% and 14% compared to the previous year. AFFO per share is now expected to grow between 9% and 11%.  CapEx is expected to range between $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, including approximately $120 million of on balance sheet xScale spend, which we expect to be reimbursed as we transfer assets into the JV later this year or early next year and about $220 million of recurring CapEx spend.  So let me stop here, and I'll turn the call back to Charles. Jon, relating to the second part of the question, just no surprise. You've seen that you'll see the sort of the margin erosion across a number of the key metrics, whether it's on a total basis, whether it's in Europe or whether it's in the stabilized assets, it's primarily related to the reset of the of the energy contracts. As you look at the first quarter, we had the benefit, if you will, of contracts -- the power contracts where they were. But as they reset, was there was a meaningful step up in the second quarter, and that was felt throughout a number of our core metrics.  And as they look forward, most of that is now going to stabilize, which is the good part. And that was all factored into the pricing sort of structure that we had when we started the year. We anticipated what the price points were going to be on an average basis, and that was the rate at which we pass through to our customers. Yes. As you can tell from the guidance we delivered and we've said -- Charles has mentioned a few times, the recurring aspect of our business is performing exceedingly well. The nonrecurring, a lot of what you experienced, particularly with the step-ups and the step downs it relates to the xScale fees. As you're wholly aware, there's two nonrecurring xScale fees and there are two recurring xScalev fees. As it relates to the nonrecurring, it's really the sales and marketing fee that has the biggest impact to our business.  So as we said, the pipeline is very deep. There's a lot of opportunity that's right in front of us. And so we anticipate that there will be a very large set of fees that get earned over the second half of the year. Right now, we're targeting that to be in the fourth quarter. I guess there's always a scenario where it could be the third quarter, but it's really -- it's a second half anticipated close. And so with that, that's what we've got in the guidance.  And then on top of that, of course, the recurring part of our business is still -- you're seeing a nice meaningful step-up on that and you just have to go to the midpoint of the guidance over the rest of the year. And you can see that, that one of those quarters is going to be one of the largest step-up you've ever seen in our history. But part of that, of course, is driven from the nonrecurring fees. And Eric just maybe just add 1 other thing. As we look forward, and Charles alluded to earlier on, as we think about some of the negotiations we have to get back capacity in some highly constrained assets and markets, part of that is Singapore. And so we are working on 1 thing that clearly we'll identify it if we come to an appropriate negotiated outcome. But suffice to say, those are the examples of things that cause those small blips, but we're going to -- we'll sort of call it out for you. David, I just probably note just on the number of projects that we have underway across 40 markets today. Again, we're in we're actually spreading our capital far and wide to capture the opportunity in most of the sort of the major centers around the globe. And as a result, that's going to be, I think, more of the emphasis going forward, smaller byte sizes that make sense, and particularly those ones that are adjacent or contiguous with their existing facilities. And that's just what you're seeing. And then you heard us talk a little bit about, at least in the prepared remarks, the new markets that we're sort of entering into.  And so we'll continue to push our advantages in our -- in the markets that we have today, but also go to markets where others are less likely to go and we get to enjoy the sort of the experiences of the retail business versus just focusing on hyperscale. Yes, Brett, just generally speaking, given the demand for data centers and all things surrounded, to that industry. The supply chains continue to be constricted. And I think even at the Analyst Day, Charles made a reference to the fact that generator 3-megawatt generated today has roughly 120-week time line. So it gives you a sense of how far out you have to start thinking and planning. And so one of the things that we tried to emphasize at the Analyst Day was we look at look at all our markets, all of the projects and determine exactly what we need where and then we have a very sophisticated procurement team that focuses on making sure we work with the larger providers and get availability either to production capacity or a slot in the production line or available capacity from the inventories. .  And I just think that's something that we prudently do. We manage ourselves, and it's something that's going to be very important on a look-forward basis as well. And you have to tie that back into the comments Charles made about power. Demand, you have to have the available power, you have the available cooling and making sure that you have the appropriate kit to roll out the data centers in a fair way that you can deliver the capacity to the need. And again, a lot of work is done on that.  The team -- the construction -- the design, construction, procurement sourcing teams are all working together in tandem, and we look out 5 years. And in some cases, as I said, we'll go out as far as 10 or 15 years like the London market where we see a broad future opportunity as well. Yes. On the first one, just recurring CapEx is when you look at it year-over-year, Q2 tends to be -- Q1 is our lowest spend on a seasonal basis, Q2 we're sort of right on line with where we thought would be 2% and that was consistent with last year. And then you see over the next two quarters, we step it up even further. So part of it is just timing and making sure we do the work that we need to, based on the needs inside the different buildings. And as a result, it'll move around by quarter, but we can sort of massage at times into different quarters. But I would just say nothing meaningfully has caused that. It was an $18 million step up quarter-over-quarter just to be exact about it.  As it relates to DSOs, as I said in the prepared remarks, our DSOs, our recovery has gone up a little bit.

We're running ahead of what we anticipated we'd be for the third quarter already. And as I said, I think DSO is an average days delinquent will go down. I'm sorry, I misunderstood your question then.

And so what you could do is pull it forward from one year and put it into the year prior. And so that's what you've just seen. We have -- we felt we had a little bit more capacity to invest in some recurring CapEx this year. That really takes away that obligation for next year."

            "name": "Charles Meyers",
            "content": "Thank you, Chip. Good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As reflected in our results, Equinix continues to enjoy momentum in our business as digital transformation accelerates the pace of innovation and changes the way business is done. By 2026, IDC is forecasting that 40% of revenue from G2000 companies will come from digital products, services and experiences, a dynamic that is reshaping the basis of competition in nearly every industry and making digital an unprecedented force for economic growth. These secular drivers, combined with an accelerating appetite for companies to rapidly integrate AI into their operations are driving increased demand for data center capacity as a broad range of service providers extend and scale their global infrastructure to support the clear enterprise commitment to hybrid and multicloud as the IT architecture of choice.  Equinix remains exceptionally well positioned to respond to this demand environment, delivering against the need for infrastructure that is more distributed, more cloud connected, more sustainable and more ecosystem-centric than ever before. Against this backdrop, we had a great second quarter with solid gross and net bookings, very strong pricing dynamics, excellent pipeline conversion and healthy new logo growth. We continue to drive disciplined sales execution at scale with more than 4,100 deals in the quarter across more than 3,100 customers, demonstrating the continued strength of our unmatched go-to-market machine and approach.  Turning to our results, as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q2 were $2.02 billion, up 14% year-over-year driven by strong recurring revenue growth, power price increases and timing of xScale fees. Adjusted EBITDA was up 7% year-over-year, and AFFO was again better than our expectations due to strong operating performance. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. With customers deployed in all three regions now representing approximately 2/3 of our recurring revenues, we continue to invest behind the scale and reach of our data center services portfolio. We now have 53 major projects underway across 40 metros in 24 countries, including 11 xScale builds that we expect will deliver approximately 90 megawatts of capacity once opened.  This quarter, we added 12 new projects, including new data center builds in Lisbon, Monterrey, Mumbai and our first build in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Over the past several years, we have seen Malaysia emerge as an increasingly important location for digital infrastructure. By expanding Platform Equinix in Johor and Kuala Lumpur, the two most strategic markets in Malaysia, we will enable local and global businesses to leverage our trusted platform to bring together and interconnect the foundational digital infrastructure that will power their success. Additionally, we are delighted with the recently announced results of Singapore's data center call for application, where Equinix was one of a very limited set of participants selected to build incremental data center capacity in the critical Singaporean market.  Equinix is honored to have this opportunity to strengthen Singapore's digital capabilities, delivering sustainable infrastructure that will fuel the economy, cultivate critical ecosystems and aligned to Singapore's green plan. Multi-region customer wins this quarter included Cogent Communications, a U.S. multinational ISP using Equinix's robust ecosystem and interconnection platform to optimize and enhance their global services and Apcela a provider of software-defined cloud-optimized networks for digitally transforming global enterprises as they leverage Equinix Fabric and other digital services for low-latency network and cloud connectivity.  Our global interconnection franchise continues to thrive with over 456,000 total interconnections on our platform. In Q2, interconnection revenue stepped up 11% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, driven by healthy pricing, increasing traffic levels and strong gross adds. Net interconnection adds remain on the lower side at 4,100 due to continued grooming activity and consolidation into higher bandwidth connections, but the number of unique interconnection relationships across our platform continues to expand with over 110,000 unique pairs, reflecting the exceptional value of our scaled digital ecosystems.  Equinix Fabric had another strong quarter with total virtual connections passing 50,000 for the first time and the addition of new capabilities to support data-intensive workloads like AI and cloud migration. Beginning in the third quarter, Fabric customers will be able to provision virtual connections to cloud providers with bandwidth up to 50 gig per second with Google Cloud as the first cloud partner to support this capability. Internet exchange saw strength in our EMEA and APAC markets with peak traffic up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 25% year-over-year to nearly 32 terabits per second.  Key interconnection customer wins this quarter included a gaming and entertainment company, expanding interconnection across all three regions to optimize the gamer experience and PEER 1 a Brazilian telco leveraging Platform Equinix to establish its digital presence through network hubs, beginning with South America and Miami.  Turning to our xScale portfolio. We continue to see strong overall demand as cloud adoption remains a driving force in digital transformation. In Q2, we leased 10 megawatts of capacity in our Osaka 2 asset with cumulative xScale leasing now over 200 megawatts globally, and we have a strong funnel of additional scale opportunities for the back half of the year. We also won three new native cloud on-ramps this quarter in Bogota\u0301, Madrid and Toronto, further strengthening our cloud ecosystem, which represents nearly 15% of total interconnection on our platform. Key enterprise to cloud ecosystem wins this quarter, including one of the largest auto insurers in the U.S., continuing to expand interconnections on our platform to optimize its networks and multi-cloud connectivity and a leading European automotive company deploying at Equinix to support reliable and scalable connectivity to the cloud worldwide.  As businesses increasingly look to consume their digital infrastructure at software speed, we're continuing to enhance our platform strategy and expand our partnerships. In Q2, we announced our expanded partnership with Hewlett Packard Enterprise for pre-provisioned HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise and HPE GreenLake for private cloud business addition, both available on demand at select Equinix IBX data centers. These new offerings in 7 metros around the globe will help businesses expand their hybrid multi-cloud strategies, while providing greater agility, control and predictability of workload costs and data. Additional key digital services wins this quarter included Bionexo to Brazil, a health tech company that offers digital solutions for managing health care processes, using fabric and network edge for seamless connections with partners and customers, while reducing complexity and cost. Telna, a global mobile network infrastructure provider using Platform Equinix to facilitate its marketplace for cellular connectivity among its customers. Our Channel program delivered another strong quarter, accounting for 40% of bookings and nearly 60% of new logos.  We continue to see growth from partners like Accenture, Avant, Dell, Cisco and HPE with wins across a wide range of industry verticals and digital use cases. Key wins this quarter included partnering with Kyndryl to support a large American health insurance provider with their network and application modernization efforts, featuring the deployment of cloud adjacent infrastructure and interconnection to the health care ecosystem.  Now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter. Thanks, Keith. In closing, we had a strong first half of the year and continue to see a robust demand environment as key secular drivers positively influence buying behavior even in the face of a challenging macro climate. The relevance of Platform Equinix continues to grow as service providers scale out their global infrastructure in response to growing enterprise demand for hybrid and multi-cloud as the architecture of choice and the associated need for hybrid infrastructure to deliver performance, agility, scalability and sustainability. In this context, we believe Equinix remains uniquely positioned and highly differentiated and will continue to drive disciplined execution of our strategy with a focus on extending our market leadership, driving operating leverage, expanding our platform capabilities to fuel sustained growth and delivering superior returns on capital, all of which we are confident will translate to distinctive and durable value for our customers, and sustained performance for you, our investors, with a keen focus on AFFO per share as our lighthouse metric.  So let me stop there and open it up for questions. Yes. We've talked about this in a few different forms. I do think that our posture has probably evolved a little bit in terms of our thinking around xScale in the Americas broadly and in the U.S. specifically. And I think AI is part of that. And so it's not the only factor, but I do think we had already been thinking about certain markets where we believe that -- what we see, as I said around the world, is that the markets where we have the full portfolio xScale retail digital services at scale, really perform best. I mean you can argue a little bit of whether it's chicken or egg there in terms of what's driving what. But it's -- what we do see is that when we have the full portfolio, we're able to address a broader set of customer demands. And so I think as we looked at that, we do think that there are markets in the U.S. that we would like to have an xScale presence. And so we're -- I think we're looking at how we would do that and potentially through a combination of organic and potentially inorganic pursuits.  So I do think that AI is a part of that, but really only a part. And I think that the continued demand for cloud services and the commitment to cloud adoption, I think, continues at pace with the enterprise, all of that driving really a strong pipeline across the world and it does lead us to believe that thinking about how to solve for xScale in Americas is something that is on our mind. Sure. Yes. I mean I'd start with the backlog question and tell you that backlog continues to be very healthy. We do see -- as we've said over the years, billable cabs can really be a pretty volatile metric, and it can swing meaningfully both due to timing of installs and therefore, backlog and in particular, churn activity. Undoubtedly, we recognize that billable cab has to grow over time to fuel the business. But we do see short-term fluctuations in that metric as we really optimize the platform. So if you look at it, as you noted, we've always encouraged people to really look at rolling forward quarter averages because of that volatility.  If you look at Americas running about 90%, the rolling four quarter is about 90% of what it's been for the last three years, typically. EMEA is actually -- its rolling fourth quarter average is actually meaningfully ahead of what the three-year average is and APAC is lower with three consecutive quarters of really lower cab adds, but it's a bit of a unique dynamic in APAC related to some of the capacity constraints in Asia particularly Singapore, which is why we are so excited to have been able to announce the allocation of capacity to Equinix in the Singaporean market. So we -- I think that we're comfortable there. There is some churn activity that I think is in the markets and some backlog that I think is going to roll through.  And so I think we'll -- when we look at that on a rolling four-quarter basis, I think we'll see those things normalize a bit. But let me -- and we knew this would be a kind of issue. So I want to maybe give you a little more concrete insight into the billable caps. If you look at it specifically on the churn side, over the past 5 quarters, we've had about 7 deployments of meaningful size churn. And 85% of that total cab volume coming from those churns are what we would consider favorable churn.  Basically, cabs that are in constrained markets where we really welcome the additional capacity and consolidate a very positive mark-to-market. And given the trajectory right now that we're seeing in the market on pricing, on power density, on interconnection, and as we refill those cabs at prevailing prices and power densities, we actually expect uplifts on those three -- about the -- 85% of those cabs in the 50% to 70% MRR uplift range. So that's just a reflection of kind of the kinds of actions that we're taking to optimize the platform that have impacts on billable cabs but really positive impacts and upside in terms of we look at it, and we believe we're going to get millions of dollars of extra MRR by sort of turning those cabinets over or tens of millions on an annual basis with zero CapEx.  And so that's some of the dynamic that you're seeing there, and I think it will move around a bit as we identify that. Now there's not that many of those out there. And so that's -- but that is a dynamic that is -- has impacted the billable cabs a bit over the last couple of quarters. Yes. It's a good question, Mike. I do think that we had guided to a range lower than certainly that 7% that we're seeing, absent the PPIs Obviously, PPIs are having a major impact there and reflected in as reported at 10%, but I think that's not really a valid number because that will bounce around a little bit, and we'll based on what's happening with power pricing. But I do think that 7%, obviously, is a very attractive level. I do think that we're seeing that pricing right now is very firm. We are raising -- we've raised prices on our underlying colo products and on interconnection meaningfully and continue to see strong demand and stable churn. And so I think that's going to be a positive factor.  The other one that I just mentioned in the previous conversation, a little bit about billable cabs is power densities. Power densities are definitely on the rise. And so some of the churn activity that I just talked about there, those 37 deployments were -- many of them are in stabilized assets. And so you're going to see uplift there as you turn some of that over. So long answer or non-answer to your question in terms of what is the right range, obviously, I think we have been talking about 3 to 5, 7 is obviously nicely above that. I would certainly hope that -- I do think the current dynamic of pricing in the market is a major driver. And so we'll just track that and see how we -- but obviously, we love being above that guided top end. And if we feel like that's a sustained trajectory, we'll come back and look at that. Yes. I figured that might come up, too, Mike. So the -- what I'd say is that we are -- obviously, we're just a little over halfway through the year. We've been hedging into our positions. And in some markets, hedging in at rates that are below where we had been previously, and in some cases, a bit somewhat materially below that. Obviously, we still have a significant portion of our hedging positions yet to fill. And there's a lot of the year left. And so it's impossible, I think, for us to predict exactly what will happen. So I don't want to be too concrete on this matter. But I would think that there might be some markets if current course continues, where we will hedge into a rate '24 that is below what it was in '23.  And as we said to our customers, and I think as we've communicated to our customers, they really sort of embraced and understood the benefits that our hedging program provides -- and we've told them if that is to -- would occur, we would pass that through to you as well. And so I think how many markets that might occur in, not sure. But as we said when we provided the guide and when we provided at Analyst Day and in other forums, said, look, we're -- this sort of assumes nothing relative to power price increases or decreases, and we'll adjust that accordingly or sort of normalize it out because what's really important from our perspective is the underlying performance of the business. And while we do recognize that power price, for example, has some impact on the optics margin. I think it really isn't an underlying fundamental sort of impact on the business.  And so we'll let you know. A shorter answer would be, I do think that we may see some markets in which we would see a PD or a price decrease next year and others that we would see it flat and perhaps others would see it go up. But still more work to do in terms of hedging into our positions, and we'll keep you updated as we know more. Yes. I'll let Keith tackle the second one. I'll give you the first one, I'll give you a little color on the quarter. Really solid quarter from a bookings perspective. And I think we saw even though I think there are some customers who continue to be cautious in the overall environment. What we saw in Q1, as we told you, we saw a little more deal slippage from Q1 into Q2, but we had said that close rates were pretty consistent. In Q2, we saw the same thing that actually very good pipeline conversion, and we saw sales cycles not really extended very much in line with our historical norms. And we saw the push rate from quarter-to-quarter actually come -- bounced back to where it had been previously.  So I would say overall, a very solid quarter. I do think the dynamic that we described previously, which is some customers just being cautious about how much capacity they're buying, obviously, negotiating hard, which is a norm for us those kind of dynamics. And then in some cases, going back and if they have more capacity than they need coming back and having a dialogue with us about whether we want to take some of that back. And as I said, that is a bit of the dynamic coloring some of our -- because we see opportunities but look very favorable for us to do that. We'll take advantage of and that's some of what's impacting the billable cabs numbers.  So overall, though, I would say, I feel good about the quarter from a sales execution standpoint and from an overall customer sentiment standpoint and also feel good about where we are in terms of overall funnel for the second half of the year. So obviously, we have a big hill to climb every quarter in terms of a lot of deals. 4,100 deals in a quarter, you got to do a lot of selling, but our team, I think, had a really strong Q2 and our -- and based on my customer visits and time with the sales teams, I think there's a lot of optimism for the second half of the year. We've seen specific instances of interconnect to support AI. In fact, we had a pretty significant win this quarter in the AI realm with an AI-as-a-service provider that really put their core network nodes with us to really drive interconnection to the multi-cloud connectivity and really to support the inference and interconnection to the cloud. And so we did see that -- I wouldn't say that's likely shown up. In fact, that hasn't shown up in our results yet because we just booked a deal. But I think that's indicative of some of what's going on there, it's probably a little tough to tell.  Interestingly, on interconnect, Jon, what I would say is that we've seen really strong gross add activity, and it's really in line with our nine quarter averages. And so that's, I think, a really encouraging sign. And in fact, interconnect to cloud at the end is up meaningfully year-over-year. It was moderated a little by the financial ecosystem, which was a little down year-over-year in terms of gross adds, but we're very stable on the Intersect side in terms of gross adds. And so -- and I'm sure that some of that is attributable to AI.  And then -- but then on the churn side, we are seeing a little bit more -- you're also seeing a little more churn activity with cloud as a VM, but more between service provider types, cloud to cloud, cloud to network, et cetera. And so -- and that's, I think, a lot of grooming, a lot of 10 to 100 migration and some M&A activity. So I gave you a little more there than you were looking for on interconnect. But I do think that we're -- you're going to see a lot of data transfer happening. And I think we're just really well positioned on that in terms of our multi-cloud connectivity and the sort of more advanced nature of fabric in terms of being more agile to that demand over time.  So we're excited about that opportunity, and that certainly is coming up a lot out there in the market is as people are talking about it. And really, I think more -- a lot on the service provider side, but also enterprise is really talking about the things they're doing to bring AI into their operations. Yes. Yes. And we certainly are actively thinking about what our -- the evolution of our design and ensuring that it's evolving and keeping pace with the market. In our retail space, we do have the -- what's really nice about the retail business is when you serve a very broad range of customers with differing density requirements, you're able to sort of dense up and extract more from the system over time. And we've really, I think, benefited from that. When you in more of the hyperscale or xScale type arena it's a little more challenging. I think you have to just be -- because you allocate all that power out typically to a single customer or maybe two in a facility, and it's a little bit different.  And so I do think average density -- design densities are going to need to be going up. I think that also to your ability to cooling is often the constraint. And I think there are -- we are actively looking at, in fact, in our innovation center in D.C., we're actively looking at and testing liquid cooling as a way to get more out of our current designs as well as implement as a more standard feature in our go-forward designs. And so I do think we're going to -- you're going to be seeing design densities going up and you're also going to be seeing us use technologies to augment existing facilities to get more out of them. Yes. And that's so much related to the interconnection because that does -- on a net basis, probably not having -- not a huge driver on the churn metric. But it is related in part to those deployments that I talked about when I was giving color on the billable cabs that related to churns that we view as favorable. Again, those 37 deployments, the 85% of those cabs are going to have mark-to-market that are in the 50% to 70% positive range. And so that's -- we're take those when we can get them. And so -- and several of those in Singapore. And so we will -- even with our additional allocation, that's out there in the future. in terms of build. And so it's a precious resource to have capacity in the Singaporean market, particularly capacity that has the kind of characteristics that we do in terms of cloud proximity and sort of network density and ability to drive the performance, et cetera.  And so we'll take that capacity. And those are some of the things that led to us seeing a little bit of an uptick there. But as we said in the prepared remarks, we're comfortable that we, on average, for the year, will end in sort of the lower part of our guided range. And you may see a little spikes in there like we did a little bit higher this quarter, but that generally is probably more attributable to favorable type turn activity. Yes, there's a lot in that question. On the -- on peak times V or Q or whichever you prefer, it's -- I think we're definitely seeing a firm pricing environment. And I think that's true of the data capacity industry at large. But I think that we see -- we obviously operate in the retail side of the business at a very different price point than the prevailing broader industry, which I think is -- centers more around a wholesale or hyperscale type price point. But both are on the rise, and I think that's going to continue to be the case for a bit of time here. I think in terms of volumes, I think volumes are also going to grow.  The question of whether or not power availability would constrain supply is an interesting question. I think that it could in market by market, but I think that -- on our side, we feel very comfortable that our relationships and our visibility to power allocations are going to allow us to continue to execute on the build plan that we have in place.  On the xScale side, I think it's a little more challenging, but we are actively working with the folks to make sure the identity that. And we're also actively looking at alternatives. And for example, things like on-site power generation, I think, are probably more of a reality in some of those -- in that market over time. So done that in certain markets. In fact, our recent Dublin facility has on-site power generation with fuel cells, natural gas-based fuel cells as a primary source of power. We actually use Bloom Energy fuel cells in Silicon Valley, not as a primary source but as a -- but I think that's -- I think we're going to continue to see trends in that area.  So I don't -- and I also think that you're going to see that if necessary, the positioning of certain forms of data center capacity, particularly in the hyperscale area and some of AI training may adapt to simply go where the power is. And so I think that you may see some of that movement as well. So I don't think quantity is going to be material constrained -- materially constrained in our retail business by power availability, but it is something that I think we, as an industry, need to continue to grapple with. Yes. Short answer is not yet. And in fact, obviously, the vast majority of our demand and our revenue and our profitability is sourced from sort of our large campus environments around the world, and that's where bulk of our land has been. You're seeing the rise in our sort of owned asset revenue because we're continuing to build now on owned land and owned facilities around the world. And so the bulk of our land bank is really still going towards that. That doesn't mean we'd necessarily be opposed to that. I think that would more likely be xScale type thing, which would probably run through the -- but I do think those are the kinds of things that we have to be thinking about.  I do think in terms of more -- some of our xScale though, I think, is going to be more approximate to our campus locations in those areas where we think we can support that. But I don't think it's out of the question we do that. But right now, the shorter answer to the question is no, that's not really yet part of our equation. Yes. Brett, I'd add that I do think that one thing I did mention previously I'll put in there now is that I think one of the really critical factors in ensuring availability for what is inevitably going to be a somewhat constrained resource on power in places around the world is to bring forward really thoughtful approach to sustainability. So -- and that was one of the driving forces, I believe, in terms of our successfully getting an allocation in Singapore. And so similarly, I think our ability to work closely with -- and I've been on the phone with utility CEOs in the recent past talking about these topics in terms of how to put our heads together and try to for some of these things and sustainability has to be, I think, part of that picture.  And so I do think that that's something we're going to bring to the table. We're going to lean in and really continue our market-leading emphasis on sustainability, not only for our customers but in tandem with our partners on the utility side as well. And so I think those are other factors that I think come into play when we really think about the power issue. Yes. Great question, Nick. I'd tell you, in all honesty, I had expected we would have seen a bit of a moderation back up towards prior levels. now. But there's a lot of factors in play there. I think that the short answer is I do believe we're going to see that because when I look at it, the gross adds continue to be really strong. So overall demand for interconnection persistent. And as I said, even growing with cloud as the end.  And so I think that, that is the most encouraging to me. When we really unpack what is suppressed the net adds, it's clearly on the churn side. And so we've unpacked that in great depth, as you might imagine. And it really is almost all from the service provider side in terms of where we're seeing the elevated churn over normal levels. And as we unpack it further, you see there is definitely 10 to 100 migration. And I think that has accelerated a bit more than we expected just because -- and maybe we should have anticipated this, but as the cost of electronics goes down, it is more broadly available to people who have a sufficient number of interconnects to really justify that.  And so we did see continued uptick. And so it seems almost like what you're seeing is 10 to 100 migration was led by the most sophisticated customers with the most at stake -- and then you see another blip as sort of the broader population begins to sort of integrate that. But again, it's not going to be relevant for everybody. You have to have some level of concentration to routes to really make it an economically viable proposition. So you're seeing 10 to 100 partially impacted there. Then you saw -- you see some M&A activity. And that's true in the CDN space and in the network space. Those are finite things. They work their way through, and then you go back to some sort of a normal.  And then I would say the third area is just a more aggressive inventory management, particularly from the network space, where as you -- many of you know better than we do, there's some real overall business challenges where people are looking to aggressively tighten their belt in any way they can. And so I think those dynamics -- several of those dynamics are finite in nature, and which is why I kind of fully had expected that we would return. And I don't know whether we get all the way back to our previously guided range, but I think we'll see -- potentially see some lift back there. Independent of all that, even at our current level of ads, we're seeing -- one, we're seeing very strong pricing and that is driving -- and we're seeing a migration towards higher port speeds on offerings that are priced by speed. And so that mix is helping.  And as a result, I think you're going to continue to see very healthy revenue growth. So we'll track that. It's certainly my hope that we will see some elevation through the back half of the year, but we'll just have to see how that plays out. Well, we can't speak to the actual size of the allocation. So I don't doubt there is information out there, but I can't confirm or deny anything relative to the size of the allegation. I would simply say that -- we're very excited about what we got. We're very excited about the opportunity to build incremental capacity in that market. And we believe it will give us some really solid runway in an incredibly important market. In the meantime, we're continuing to sort of very opportunistically harvest capacity to continue to meet the demands of our customers and to drive very superior returns in that market."

With us today are Charles Meyers, Equinix's CEO and President; and Keith Taylor, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions from sell-side analysts. In the interest of wrapping this call up in one hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to one. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thank you, Chip. Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We had a strong start to the year, delivering quarterly revenues right at $2 billion with adjusted EBITDA and AFFO above the top end of our expectations. Despite a challenging macro environment, customers remain committed to their digital transformation journeys, driving 4,000 deals in the quarter across more than 3,000 customers, highlighting the scale and diversity of our go-to-market engine and the broad-based demand that continues to propel the business. We continue to see enterprises and service providers build out their IT infrastructure on Platform Equinix. And that infrastructure is more distributed, more cloud connected and more hybrid than ever before. And while some customers are appropriately cautious about the timing of their investments given macro conditions, Equinix continues to be a critical partner in their efforts to advance hybrid architectures, unlock digital performance gains and optimize cloud and network spend. As a result, our deal win rates remain steady compared to historical trends, and we continue to see a robust pricing environment across all three regions. Turning to power. We're very pleased with how the organization has navigated a volatile energy market and we remain in a strong position, significantly mitigating the impacts of this volatility for our business and for our customers. As previously discussed, we raised pricing in January to more than 7,000 customers across 16 countries, generating approximately $90 million of incremental revenue in the quarter, fully offsetting the impact of higher power costs. Thanks to timely and transparent communications, concessions and disputes are low and our days of sales outstanding remain in line with historical trends. On the sustainability front, we are committed to responsible growth and continue to advance our bold future first sustainability agenda. Sustainability is increasingly becoming a board-level issue and Gartner estimates that by 2026, 75% of organizations will seek to increase business with IT vendors that have demonstrable sustainability goals and timelines, and we'll seek to replace those who don't. We recently published our eighth annual CSR report. And in 2022, we extended our industry leadership with 96% renewable energy coverage, making our fifth consecutive year with over 90% coverage. We're also progressing well on our science-based targets with a 23% reduction in operational emissions across Scope 1 and Scope 2 from our 2019 baseline. Additionally, Equinix continues to evolve its power procurement portfolio to increase the quality of its renewable energy purchases. This year, we signed new long-term power purchase agreements for solar projects in Spain totaling 345 megawatts of capacity, bringing Equinix's contracted renewable energy PPA portfolio to 715 megawatts globally once fully operational. Looking forward, where feasible, we'll continue to prioritize projects that create new sources of clean energy directly in the grids where we operate and support a healthy renewable energy coverage mix. Turning to our results. As depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q1 were $2 billion, up 16% year-over-year, driven by strong recurring revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA was up 18% year-over-year, and AFFO was better than our expectations due to strong operating performance. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our unmatched scale and reach continues to differentiate our data center services portfolio and the tremendous strength of our balance sheet positions us to sustain our investment in new capacity to support a robust demand environment. We currently have 50 major projects underway across 37 metros in 25 countries, including 10x scale projects that will deliver more than 90 megawatts of capacity once opened. This quarter, we added new data center builds in Lagos, Frankfurt and Rio de Janeiro. Revenues from multi-region and three region customers increased 1% quarter-over-quarter to an impressive 76% and 65%, respectively. Key multi-region wins in the quarter included a Fortune 500 manufacturing conglomerate, expanding its Performance Hub deployments across all three regions to assist with a business unit divestiture and in Cloud Native Zero Trust cybersecurity company using Equinix Metal to expand its business across all three regions. Our platform remains the logical point of Nexus for hybrid and multi-cloud deployments and hyperscalers continue to look to Equinix as a critical infrastructure provider and a valued go-to-market partner. This quarter, we won five new cloud on-ramps across Milan, Mumbai, Muscat, Tokyo and Warsaw as we continue to enjoy a strong leadership position in multi-cloud connectivity compared to our closest competitors. We're also seeing the unique breadth of our product portfolio across retail colo, interconnection services, xScale and digital services resonate strongly with customers as they embrace rapidly emerging opportunities in AI. We've closed several key AI wins over the past few quarters and are seeing a growing pipeline of new opportunities directly and with key partners for both training and inference use cases that benefit from the unique performance characteristics and multi-cloud proximity of our platform. In our xScale portfolio, we continue to see strong overall demand. In Q1, we pre-leased our entire Frankfurt 16 asset representing 14 megawatts of capacity taking us to over 75% leased or pre-leased across our nearly 260 megawatts of operational and announced xScale facilities. And we have a strong funnel of additional xScale opportunities in the coming quarters. Enterprise to cloud wins this quarter included a leading consumer products company leveraging Equinix\u2019s robust ecosystems for their private multi-cloud connectivity needs and the Hearst Corporation, a diversified media company deploying on platform Equinix to execute its cloud first strategy, including the deployment of network edge for their network aggregation. Turning to our industry leading interconnection business, we now have over 452,000 total interconnections on our platform. In Q1, interconnection revenue stepped up 12% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. And we added an incremental 5,300 interconnections for the quarter. We saw some continued grooming activity and consolidation into higher bandwidth BCs on Fabric, but both moderated from the prior quarter. While gross ads remain strong, pricing is firm and the diversity of our customer interconnection continues to expand.  As global data volumes continue to accelerate, internet exchange saw peak traffic up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 26% year-over-year to greater than 30 terabits per second for the first time. And as enterprises continue to embrace hybrid and multi-cloud as their architecture of choice, they're increasingly seeking the security performance and convenience of Equinix Fabric to connect to their choice of cloud and IT services across the broader digital ecosystem. One example is Cisco whose multiple edge delivered services now rank among the leading end destinations on Fabric. Customer wins included Caixa, Brazil's federal financial services company partnering with Equinix to accelerate its business by optimizing and securing its network core via Fabric. We also continue to enhance our platform with our digital services portfolio and saw a strong new user growth for our Equinix Metal offering as we cultivate product like growth. Wins this quarter included a Japanese video game company utilizing Equinix Metal in all three regions to support a new product launch and restack an Australian SaaS integrator and managed services provider utilizing Equinix Fabric and our edge services to optimize their solution offerings. Our channel program delivered another strong quarter accounting for roughly 35% of bookings and 60% of new logos. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and digital first-use cases with strong engagement across the hyperscalers and continued momentum with partners like AT&T, Dell, Cisco, HPE, Orange business and Zenlayer. Key wins included a digital modernization win with Entel, our largest local partner in Chile, on behalf of Empresa Nacional [indiscernible] at Chile and oil and gas company. Entel is delivering a fully managed SDYM [ph] solution based upon Cisco technology while leveraging Equinix data center and interconnection services demonstrating how local partners can help deliver value to clients in new Equinix markets. Now let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results for the quarter.\nKeith Taylor: Thanks Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. As highlighted by Charles, we had an outstanding start to the year. As you can see from our financial results, the team delivered on multiple fronts in the quarter. We had record net bookings including power price increases. Excluding those prior price increases, our net bookings performance was solid. The result of, again, net positive pricing actions across each of our regions and lower MRR churn. Global MRR per cabinet yield increase by $124 per cabinet on an as reported basis are about $27 per cabinet adjusting per prior price increases another one-offs. And as we highlighted on the last earnings call, we completed our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet raising both debt and equity in the quarter and remain well funded to meet our future growth expectations. Now, as you would expect, despite the continued strength of our business, we remain highly focused on the broader market dynamics. But as we've stated before, during periods of disruption, Equinix thrives given our high quality and diverse set of customers who view Equinix as a mission critical partner to place their ecosystem driven digital infrastructure, whether it be a cloud on-ramp, a networking node, a cable landing station, or a trading platform. I do remember 90% of our quarterly bookings come from those existing customers as they expand their current environment or maybe move to more markets or simply buy more services. Finally, our strong liquidity position, low dividend, AFFO payout ratio and reduce debt leverage allows us to continue to invest to expand our product portfolio and expand our global footprint in both cases driving top line growth. Simply put, we're in a strong, fully funded financial position allowing us to meet all of our capital meets while maintaining the strategic and operational flexibility we need to grow and scale the business.  Now let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Know that all comments in this section are on an normalizing constant currency basis. As depicted on a Slide 4 , global Q1 revenues were $1.998 billion, up 16% over the same quarter last year, and above the top end of our guidance range due to strong recurring revenues and the timing of xScale non-recurring fees. As we've noted before, non-recurring revenues, particularly those revenues attributed to our xScale business and custom installation works are inherently lumpy and given the momentum we're seeing in our xScale business across all three regions. Non-recurring revenues could fluctuate meaningfully over the next three quarters of the year.  Q1 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $2 million tailwind when compared to our prior guidance range due to our weaker U.S. dollar in the quarter. Global Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $944 million or 47% of our revenues up 18% over the same quarter last year, and again above the top end of our guidance range due to strong operating performance including flat quarter-by-quarter SG&A spent. As expected, Q1 adjusted EBITDA benefited from lower seasonal power consumption and favorable energy hedge rates, which will reset higher starting in Q2 as anticipated, resulting in increased net utility spend over the next three quarters of the year. Q1 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges included a $2 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates and $5 million of integration costs. Global Q1 AFFO was $802 million, above our expectations due to strong business performance, including lower net interest expense and income taxes. As expected, we had seasonally lower recurring CapEx spend consistent with prior years. Q1 AFFO included a $2 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q1 MRR term was 2%, a continued reflection of our disciplined sales strategy. For the full year, we expect MRR churn to average at the low end of 2% to 2.5% of our quarterly range. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized basis, EMEA was our fastest-growing region at 28% due to our significant power increases. Excluding the benefit attributed to those price increases, EMEA growth was 14%. Our APAC and Americas region growth rates were 15% and 9%, respectively. The Americas region had another solid quarter with strong performance from our public sector team and continued favorable pricing trends. We saw strong momentum in our Chicago, Culpeper, Seattle metros and a Brazilian business. Our EMEA business delivered a great quarter, successfully executing on our price increase program while also seeing lower-than-expected MRR churn. In the quarter, we saw bookings strength in our Amsterdam, Dublin and Manchester metros. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a solid quarter led by our Mumbai, Tokyo and Singapore markets with strong new logo additions and firm pricing. Now while Singapore remains capacity constrained as part of our IBX optimization efforts, we continue to proactively negotiate with certain customers with larger deployments to recover capacity which we anticipate to be backfilled at much higher rates, although it could affect our in-quarter MRR churn and net CapEx billing metric. And now looking at the capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our balance sheet increased to approximately $31.3 billion, including an unrestricted cash balance of $2.6 billion. Our cash balance increased quarter-over-quarter due to strong operating cash flow while we also raised approximately $580 million of yen-denominated debt and closed at the prior year's forward sales from our ATM program. Our net leverage remains low at 3.4 times our adjusted EBITDA with 96% of our outstanding debt being fixed with no near-term maturities. Given the global nature of our business, we continue to look to raise additional debt capital and reduce rate countries where we intend to expand, creating both incremental debt capital to fund our growth and placing natural hedges into these markets. Turning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $530 million, including seasonally lower recurring CapEx of $22 million. Since our last earnings call, we opened four retail projects in Frankfurt, Paris, Singapore and Sydney. We also purchased land for development in Calgary and Madrid. Revenues from owned assets were 63% of our recurring revenues for the quarter. Our capital investments delivered strong returns, as shown on Slide 10, are now 171 stabilized assets increased revenues by 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Taking out the benefit attributed to power price increases, stabilized assets increased 7% year-over-year. Consistent with prior years, in Q1, we completed the annual refresh of our IBX categorization exercise. Our stabilized asset count increased by a net 13 IBXs. Now stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for our updated summary of 2023 guidance and bridges. Do note, all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. For the full year, we're raising our revenue guidance by $30 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance by $20 million, primarily due to favorable FX rates and lower integration costs. This guidance implies a revenue growth rate of 14% to 15%, inclusive of power price increases or 9% to 10%, excluding the power cost pass-through and adjusted EBITDA margins of 45%, excluding integration costs. We now expect to incur $33 million of integration costs in 2023. And we're raising 2023 AFFO [ph] guidance by $44 million to now grow between 10% and 13% compared to the previous year, and AFFO per share is now expected to grow 8% to 11%. 2023 CapEx is expected to range between $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, including approximately $150 million of on-balance sheet xScale spend, which we expect to be reimbursed as we transfer assets into the JVs of about $205 million of recurring CapEx spend. So let me stop here. I'm going to turn the call back to Charles.\nCharles Meyers: Thanks, Keith. In closing, we had a solid start to the year. While we remain vigilant to the challenges in the broader macro economy. Our Q1 results were strong and our outlook remains positive with the overall demand for digital transformation, fueling our conviction around the long-term secular drivers of our business. We look forward to our upcoming Analyst Day in June where we will further outline the significant opportunity ahead and discuss our strongly differentiated position in capturing this opportunity as we enable our customers to access all the right places, partners and possibilities. We also look forward to diving more deeply into our evolving platform capabilities, our industry-leading go-to-market engine and sharing expectations of how all of this will translate into durable and differentiated value creation for our investors, our customers and the communities in which we operate. So let me stop there and open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first caller is Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead. \nMatt Niknam: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two quick ones, if I could. First, on bookings trends. Can you comment at all in terms of linearity and whether you saw any potential slowdown going to some of the macro choppiness that really picked up in March. We've heard maybe a similar theme from some others across tech. And then just the second one on cap allocation, specifically just related to potential inorganic opportunities. Just wondering what you're seeing in terms of opportunities both domestically and abroad whether seller expectations have become more reasonable just in the context of leverage now sitting just shy of 3.5 turns. Thanks. \nCharles Meyers: Thanks, Matt. Yes. Look, I think overall, as we said in the script, I think we continue to feel good about the demand level. I think definitely, customers are feeling tighter budgets, looking to stretch their dollars. But I think their commitment to digital is strong. And I think how they're using us in terms of looking to capture savings in a variety of areas. And again, long-term digital transformation equipments are driving pretty solid activity levels. So I think the overall, we did about 4,000 deals in the quarter of 3,000 customers, very much in line with kind of what we've done in prior quarters. Linearity was pretty good. And so we probably saw a few more deals slip into the following quarter than we would have in previous quarters. And then on sales cycle, just to give you more of a concrete data point to hang your hat on, we usually see about 45% - I'm sorry, about 40% of our deals extend beyond the 90-day sales cycle. And that rose in this last quarter to about 45%. So a little bit of an increase, but not particularly material. And as we saw a little bit of slippage, actually our linearity in Q2 is already looking pretty good. So we started with a little bit richer funnel and so we're off to a good start in Q2. So again, I think that clearly, you're feeling a little bit of caution in the macro market, but overall, I think in terms of what people are \u2013 how they're thinking about digital, how they're thinking about Equinix in that context, we continue to see a pretty good overall environment. Relative to your second question on capital allocation, look, our balance sheet, thanks to our team's efforts, is in a really good place. And as I've said in a number of settings, I do think there's going to be opportunities for us, both organically and inorganic, I don't think we're starting to see, I think, some softening in multiples. And I think that's likely to continue depending on kind of overall sort of recessionary sort of dynamics and that kind of thing. And so we'll keep an eye on that. I do think as a market leader and we've got a long track record of being able to unlock value from M&A, and we're definitely positioned to do that if the right things come along. And so I do think that we probably expect some capital allocation towards that. And I think our balance sheet puts us in a really good position. Keith, anything to add there?\nKeith Taylor: Yes, Matt, if I can just maybe add a couple of quick points to what Charles said. The other part about the leverage being a little bit lower than we typically run at it, part just because of the money that we raised and the opportunity we sort of went for us to go into the market and draw on some \u2013 particularly on the debt capital in Japan, that put more cash on our balance sheet. And so that cash is going to get consumed, but one of the things I wanted to certainly you and the rest of the listeners to walk away with is that we do have the cash. We have the flexibility both operationally and structurally, but we're going to consume the cash. And in many ways, we're paying today for one, we're fully funded for all that we see, but you look forward in time and say, well, what are we going to do in 2024 and what are we going to do in 2025. And so you're already \u2013 we're already thinking ahead and hence my comments that we want to continue to raise capital because we know our dividend, our dividend is going to grow. We know we're going to continue to spend capital and the like. And we want to have that flexibility that Charles sort of alludes to when things shake themselves free, if it makes sense for us, then we would certainly strike, and we need a good strong balance sheet. All that said, at the end of the day, we're going to consume the cash, we're going to consume it into our growth cycles. And our leverage is actually going to go up because we're measuring it on a net debt basis. And again, I just think we all like the flexibility and the liquidity we have as a company, and we can use that to our fullest advantage going forward.\nMatt Niknam: That\u2019s great. Thank you both. \nKeith Taylor: Thanks, Matt. \nOperator: Our next caller is Jon Atkin with RBC. You may go ahead. \nJon Atkin: Thanks. Got a couple of questions. One on Slide 10, where you have the stabilized growth, 11% top line. I think that's a record. And I just wanted to get a sense as to what was driving that and then another metrics question, just the Americas cabinet equivalents actually was down sequentially and MRR gift [ph] to bid in APAC and in EMEA, the cabinets billing number didn't grow at all, the footnote referenced timing of installs and churn and I wonder if you can kind of drill down on that a bit. Thanks. \nCharles Meyers: Yes. Great question, Jon. So on stabilized growth, obviously, incredible results fueled, obviously, in part by PPI on the power price increase. So 11% is definitely really high. If you take out the effects of power price increase, that still takes you down to about 7%, so really attractive. And if you take out the new stabilized assets, which are obviously less mature and probably growing faster than others, take \u2013 we take it down to about 5% from the previous sort of portfolio of stabilized assets. So that's still at the high end of the 3% to 5% that we've been talking about. But this is pretty typical of the dynamic as you very well know, when you add in sort of a new set of stabilized assets sort of [indiscernible] the growth a little bit up. And then as you increase utilization and sort of tap out that growth, it might tend to sort of come back down a little bit. And then ROIC goes a little bit in the opposite direction. It's sort of impaired by the fact that these are less mature, but then I think we would tend to rise back. And so overall, we feel really good about stabilized assets. And I think they are a reflection of the strength of the business model. Billable cabs, yes, for sure, definitely good solid quarter in Americas. APAC is coming off a really strong quarter last quarter and so it was flat this one, EMEA actually had sort of no meaningful adds the last couple of quarters. And I know that creates a little sort of mental distance for people to see a couple of quarters without billable cabs. But I think it's important to remember that really the dynamics of the business as such. In EMEA, actually, if you look at eight quarter, 12 quarter trend, we've actually had a lot of strength there in terms of cabinet adds and you get into a situation where essentially you start seeing high utilization rates in certain markets Therefore, you're probably going to see a little less large footprint and then you actually start sort of a cycle of looking for good churn to try to make room. And that kind of \u2013 can lead to some flat spots, I think, from billable caps. But we always encourage people to really look at a longer-term trend. We clearly will grow can will and need to grow billable cabs across all three regions. And with the size of the development pipeline that we have, that will happen. But let me give you just a data point on Europe, one of the things \u2013 this happened in Europe, and it gives \u2013 I think it's something to sort of hang your hat on and really reinforce why we talk so much about our strategy and maintaining discipline in our strategy because we could turn ourselves into cabinet fingers and that's really not what we want. And so if you look at Europe, we actually had a churn this quarter in a market that is very tight about 440 cabs. And that was \u2013 it was a pretty low dense implementation from a power density standpoint and not really well interconnected. And so we were getting a cabinet yield there well below our average. When we go to resell that, we will likely resell that in significantly more small to midsized deals than sort of one big footprint. And when you look at what's likely to happen there, we're probably going to increase the revenue and therefore, the yield per cabinet, when you get more interconnection, higher power density and a higher price point, we'll probably increase the revenue from those 440 cabs, 50% from that capacity when all is said and done. And so the significant growth with no billable \u2013 essentially zero increase in billable cabs and no incremental CapEx. And so this is why when you hear us talk constantly about right customer, right application, right assets. And that's more than just a sort of a clever thing for the earnings call. That's a way of life here in terms of how we drive our sales team. And I think that gives you kind of a good reflection. So you will see the billable cab growth, but I think right now, you're seeing good healthy growth across those because I think we're playing every lever, power density, price point, interconnection, and I think it's really driving health in the business.\nJon Atkin: And then if I can follow up on AI. You mentioned some wins there. And what are we seeing in terms of rough sizes? Are they \u2013 do they tend to be very cost connect rich or more density rich or what how you kind of qualify and characterize the AI demand you're seeing so far?\nCharles Meyers: Yes. I think it's a little early to tell, but we have seen \u2013 it's interesting because ChatGPT has created a media frenzy around AI. But the reality is we've seen AI-related opportunities in our pipeline for the last several years. And for those that are familiar with the story and out on the investor circuit with us, you've heard me talk about that. And I think that most typically, it is people thinking about how to use their data and where to place their data. And what we're seeing is actually a trend towards people saying, we want to take our data and place it sort of inter cloud. We want to have control of that data. We want to intersect it with other data sources and we want to be able to move it into and out of clouds as appropriate for these things. And so we have seen some large training model training opportunities. Those are partially economically driven just it's actually cheaper to do on sort of dedicated hardware. If you have sort of a sustained commitment to doing AI training. And so we've seen some of those. And then inference deals, which I think are going to be a bit more interconnected, are where people are actually deploying inference AI inference use cases that are sort of \u2013 and I think we're going to be uniquely well suited is when insights are both, one, when data sets are dynamic and they're updated frequently, and they're taking in a lot of new data. And secondly, where insights are real-time and mission-critical. I think \u2013 and that really doesn't sort of fit the profile of the way current large language models like ChatGPT are being used. But we do think that what's going to happen is people are going to build vertically oriented sort of AI use cases on top of foundational models that are going to be sort of cloud-centric. And I think that we're going to be well suited to responding to some of those opportunities. So I think it's going to be a mix. I actually think some of the training stuff, Jonathan, is going to be more suited to our xScale portfolio. And I think some of the inference stuff is probably going to land in the retail portfolio at the digital edge. And so that's sort of the current dynamic, but early days, but I think an exciting incremental opportunity, and we're going to talk a little bit more about that at Analyst Day.\nJon Atkin: Thank you. \nOperator: The next caller is Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead. \nNick Del Deo: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First, Keith, I thought some of your comments about Singapore and the opportunities to monetize that space are pretty interesting. I mean is the plan to just move those customers across the straight to Johor or some other market or are they going to be let go? How impactful do you think this might be over time and when might it your results? And are there other markets where this might come into play or is Singapore kind of unique situation?\nKeith Taylor: Well, first, it dovetails nicely into what Charles was really talking about in the European theater, where you have a tight market, you make some decisions about looking to optimize the environment. And with that, sometimes customers move out some of the large deployments. As it relates specifically to Singapore, my reference was no different really than again, what Charles is talking about. But we do see an opportunity. There happens to be a larger installation related to customer. And it maybe it does move to a different market for us, and that would be fine. But the real focus is getting capacity in the Singapore market, getting a price uplift and again, going back to what Charles talked about, that we are sort of maybe with the bread crumbs that we see something that we're looking at right now that is going to be upsized. And of course, when we do that, it has an impact on the net cabinets billing. And of course, it has an impact on our churn metric. I maintain the word churn is going to be at the lower end of our range for the year. So I'm not worried about that. But this billing cab \u2013 billing cabinet metric is the 1 that we're always sort of looking at, causes us a little bit of discomfort because we know we're doing the right thing for the business and yet it presents itself maybe a little bit unfairly to us. And so \u2013 the bottom line is that's an initiative that we would embark upon. And Singapore is not the only market. Any place that we see that opportunity. And again, I will refer back to Charles' comment, but we don't need \u2013 where we can get an uplift an optimization of the asset. We don't have to put more capital to work and you're driving value into the equation. And so that's just a real good outcome for us. And if we can do that in places, we are tight and there is the demand, we'll make sure that we do it.\nCharles Meyers: Yes. Nick, I'd offer a little bit more color in that saying, we have a few examples where I think we have footprints that probably would have been better suited to xScale facilities had we had them at the time that we took them that now we are sort of saying, hey, that we would really need that capacity for \u2013 to fuel the retail footprint. And obviously, in Singapore, there's a broader sort of capacity constraint concern, it's really critical that we recapture those. And so \u2013 but there are other \u2013 other markets where I think we see some of that opportunity and other markets in which some of these capacity constraints might come into play. It's also one of the reasons why I think we have to continue to lean in on sustainability. And the connection between those things is, I think, for us to make sure we're going to be in line to get the power allocations needed, the permits needed, et cetera, to continue to drive capacity in markets where jurisdictions are quite reasonably looking at how to manage their energy needs. I think it's going to be important that we are able to say, hey, we're the responsible party to partner with to continue to be a digital leader but be that in a really responsible way. So a lot of sort of interconnections between those various thoughts and threats.\nNick Del Deo: That's great. That's great. Thanks for that color. Charles, can I ask one on interconnection. You talked about how adds came back in Q1 versus Q4, still below trend, though. Can you share any updated expectations regarding when we should see that growing dynamic abate and get adds back to more normal levels?\nCharles Meyers: Absolutely. Yes, as I noted, there's a few on the last call and in the script, there's a few factors that play out interconnection. Overall, one thing I'd say is traffic levels continue to be really attractive. You're seeing that in exchange. You're seeing that in terms of in fabric overall provision capacity. It's a little tougher for us to tell on physical cross-connects, exactly how much traffic is flowing because we don't \u2013 we don't like the electronics on those things. But it's fair to say that \u2013 I think what you're seeing is a trend towards significantly higher speeds to support higher and higher traffic. And by the way, I think AI is going to only add fuel to that fire. So gross adds have been strong. That's one of the things that we really look at is say, how many gross adds are there. And I think that's a primary indicator of health, and those have been very much in line with the four quarter averages. There is some grooming activity. As I said last quarter, we thought that would moderate \u2013 it did moderate to some degree, but was still there at an elevated level. I do think people are going to run out of low-hanging fruit on that one. And so I think that we'll eventually see more moderation there, and that will help the net adds further. I think this trend towards higher speeds, though is a more sustained trend. And so I think we're just going to have to look at kind of how \u2013 where things settle out. We've seen this in the past where traffic is sort of catching up to provision capacity a little bit. And so \u2013 but again, I think the long-term trend here is very high degrees of traffic flow, higher degrees of interconnection. The diversity we're seeing in the interconnection system and ecosystem is increasingly rich. So more a [indiscernible] sort of unique connections. And overall, just the strength is good. So 12% revenue growth a little lighter on the unit side. I do think we'll see some more moderation of the grooming per se, but I do think that that will be offset that we'll still see a little bit more in terms of fewer higher speed circuits. And so we'll just \u2013 we'll continue to track that. But I'll give you the punch line here. Interconnection is well north of $1 billion business for us, growing at 12% at very, very attractive returns on capital. And I think that the opportunity for us to continue to sort of lean into that and grow that business, particularly as we grow fabric. And as we think about what the bigger cloud networking opportunity looks like and what our role in it is \u2013 continues to be a big part of the Equinix story.\nNick Del Deo: All right. That\u2019s great. Thanks guys. \nOperator: Our next caller is Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead. \nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. Good evening. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about pricing outside of the power price increases. We certainly heard a lot on the hyperscale side of prices firming and you referenced some of the capacity constraints in the market. So what are you seeing both in xScale and then also just in your core business around the opportunities to continue to take price both on new business and on renewals. And then maybe a little bit on metal, both in terms of customer adoption and in terms of your continuing to roll out the product across your footprint? Thanks. \nCharles Meyers: Lots in there. So let me try to hit them all. So yes, pricing is definitely firm. Obviously, PPIs have gotten a lot of airtime, but I think perhaps an even more important trend is our ability to sort of sustain pricing power on sort of the broader portfolio of service offerings. And so we have elevated our costs on space, power and interconnection from a list price perspective across all our markets. And so I think you're going to see that continuing to sort of roll into the business. xScale pricing has definitely firmed in across the world. And so I think we're seeing attractive price points and good solid cash and cash returns on the product projects that we're underwriting. And as we said, we got a very high degree of pre-leasing there. And so \u2013 and again, we've raised pricing both on the retail side, space, power and on the interconnection units. So we have \u2013 and then you have the escalators and we are \u2013 our escalators are also going up. And so in some cases, we're doing CPI or other index-based escalators, but then more broadly, if we're doing fixed escalators, they are much higher than they have been in the past. And so I think we're seeing all of that roll through as a clear dynamic in the business in terms of and you're seeing it show up in MRR per cap, right? I mean, we gave you a headline stat there and keep script about how MRR per cab is increasing. Yes, a big chunk of it due to PPI. But even absent that, I think our yield per cab, which is an absolutely critical metric for us continues to rise. So \u2013 and then on metal, we talked a couple about a couple of really nice wins. We are really cultivating early users in what is more of a product-led growth motion that's probably a little bit more typical of SaaS providers. And so we're cutting our teeth on that to be candid, but we're getting the hang of it. And we are seeing some uptake from developers and from started digitally native service providers. And we're also seeing some pretty big opportunities in our funnel about more traditional service providers or large enterprises looking to reduce the pain of managing the technology life cycle and metal really helps with that. So we'll probably talk more about that at the Analyst Day as well. But goes continue to feel good about the underlying drivers of that business and kind of why we did that acquisition in the first place.\nSimon Flannery: Thanks a lot. \nOperator: Our next caller is David Barden with Bank of America. You may go ahead. \nDavid Barden: Hi guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I guess, Keith, I just want to make sure we all have the right jumping off point. So thank you for the waterfall for the 2Q EBITDA guide. And I just wanted to understand the combination of forces of the kind of impact of the roll-off of the hedges and you kind of increased usage as they kind of merge together to kind of create this $43 million kind of move down at the midpoint? And then assuming that that's the right jumping off point that these hedges are the right levels for the rest of the year. It implies about a $14 million sequential EBITDA growth in 3Q and 4Q to get to the midpoint of the full year guide. Could you talk a little bit about what the drivers of that will look like? Is it going to be kind of a steady cost structure with pretty much volume and price being the drivers of the margin? Any color there would be super helpful. Thank you. \nKeith Taylor: Sure. Well. Thanks, David, and thanks for \u2013 laying over there. And I think, first, if you start on the red line and you look at sort of the quarter-over-quarter movement, the first thing you notice is that it is not an overly substantial increase quarter-over-quarter coming off such a big number from Q1 relative to Q4 last quarter. But one of the things you'll appreciate and those hands was built into my comments in my script, nonrecurring revenue is moving around quite a bit. And right now, we're making the underlying assumption that it's not hitting in any specific quarter. And so what you're seeing is a meaningful step down in nonrecurring revenue between Q1 and Q2. So that's the first thing. And so you feel that in many different ways, but you certainly do feel it on the EBITDA line as well. The second thing is sort of attached to that is xScale we are \u2013 as Charles alluded to in his script, we sold out on complete asset in Frankfurt, and we are very active in some \u2013 across all three regions of the world, and we anticipate a lot more xScale activity. And so you'll see that play itself out into the year or throughout the rest of the year. Right now, our MRR trends about 5% of revenue for the year. I think it's probably going to be roughly 5% of revenue. But the range is going to be somewhere between 4.2% and about 7% and between the next three quarters. And we don't know exactly where. So we haven't really guided as well as we maybe would want to given the set of circumstances. And then the last piece I'd just say, look, there's an element of conservatism built into our model here for obvious reasons. And again, we're trying to be very prudent about what we look at. We give you \u2013 we know what we did for the first quarter. We're running a little bit ahead. That was again, associated with xScale, the xScale fees. But as we look forward, we really just wanted to at this stage of the game, give you the FX and then continue to look at what's going on in the business. As it relates specifically to the power and the power costs, Again, no surprise. We've been very thoughtful about the power dynamics for this year and the power price increases. And we had to factor in and look exactly what was the cost going to be for the year, including when do the hedges roll off and when did some other start and what's going on. And in the regulatory \u2013 the regulated environment. And then there are some other markets that we are going to be putting price increases through effective on May 1, and that's Hong Kong and Tokyo. So looking at all of that, more specifically, our costs are going up. And so you're going to feel that throughout the rest of the year. It's baked into the guide already was baked into the original guide. So this isn't a shift and what you should see is really EBITDA profitability continued to increase throughout the rest of the year. So again, I think we've got a making of a really good plan here, but we're going to \u2013 we're sort of holding firm on what we hopefully shared with you when we started the year knowing that one other thing that's really working in our favor is currency. And again, we get a little bit of currency, but we're all sort of reading the same thing. If you look at what the U.S. dollar could do anywhere between now and the next 12 months, some are calling for a 5% depreciation, so we're calling as high as a 15% depreciation of the U.S. dollar and 60% of our revenues reside outside of the U.S. and you don't have to go very far to figure out what is the implication of that is 60% of our revenues move 5% or 15% before taking into consideration the hedges. You have a really substantial move on top line and on bottom line. And that drives a lot of value on a per share basis. So hopefully, that gives you sort of a full look at all the things we're thinking about and try to share with you. But at this point, we felt really comfortable just sort of holding firm on our guide and just give you a little bit of FX and some operating performance coming out of Q1.\nCharles Meyers: Yes. Maybe Dave, a little bit of more color is that I think \u2013 I will tell you that we are also focused on every element of the business model. So if you look at the revenue line, say, P times Q, we feel very good about P, continue to feel good about Q and we're going to continue to work the heck out of that. I would say that at the next sort of a click down on cost of goods, we're continuing to drive efficiency sort of projects across the business to try to improve cost of goods and gross margin.  Then when you look down further, I also think just given the broader \u2013 we\u2019re going to continue to be diligent on spent. We did spend \u2013 we opened up the wallet a bit to make sure we can add some more headcount, and we\u2019re trying to bring them up productivity as quickly as possible. But you saw a flat SG&A spend quarter-over-quarter, and we\u2019re going to continue to be very disciplined about that as well. And so, we\u2019re going to work every element of the model and continue to do what we need to do to try to deliver the long-term performance.\nDavid Barden: Thank you both so much. It\u2019s really great.\nOperator: Our next caller is Michael Elias with TD Cowen. You may go ahead.\nMichael Elias: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just first you talked about organic and inorganic opportunities. Just wondering if you could give us a sense of the markets that you\u2019re prioritizing or perhaps regions that you\u2019re prioritizing from that perspective. And then also, there were some press reports out earlier today suggesting that Equinix is exploring the sale of Hong Kong data center assets. Maybe without commenting on that specifically, just at a high level, do you view capital recycling this year as a likely option? Thanks.\nCharles Meyers: Yes. Why don\u2019t we \u2013 I\u2019ll take the first one and then Keith can comment on the second one there relative to Hong Kong. But on M&A as I said, I do think there\u2019s opportunities for us. We\u2019ve talked about where some of those markets might be. I think Southeast Asia is going to continue to be an area of opportunity, we believe over time. And there\u2019s several key markets there that I think we\u2019ve got our eyes on. We\u2019ve actually done a couple of organic projects already in Indonesia and Malaysia, and we\u2019re going to continue to stay sort of eyes very wide open in terms of opportunities for us in that area. India, we\u2019ve announced a new build in Chennai, but I do think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity in India, and I think that could be a combination over time of organic and inorganic. And I think that we also I think one of the things that we have not done a lot of, or we haven\u2019t done any of it yet, but I think that could be on radar, is thinking about opportunities from an xScale perspective in partnership with our partners. All of those probably represent some level of opportunity for us M&A and I think as we look at some of the dynamics and opportunities in the market, including AI. I think that could be those could be all very relevant for us. So that\u2019s the first question, and then I\u2019ll let \u2013 I\u2019ll kick it over to Keith and he can talk a bit about the \u2013 this capital recycling question.\nKeith Taylor: Yes. And thanks Charles. So Michael, I\u2019ll say a few things. First and foremost, we typically are not a recycler of assets. I think you have to step back and we\u2019ve said this, actually one of the analyst stay, I think it was, might have been the last one, where\u2019re basically we\u2019re a platform and all assets are very important to the platform. And in particular, Hong Kong is a very important asset to us and something that is important to our platform. So we don\u2019t think about the business as selling assets, but we do also \u2013 we do think about ways \u2013 innovative ways to allow us to scale and grow the business. And an example of that is our Jakarta business, where we recently entered into our partnership with a large conglomerate so that we go into that market in tandem. And it just, it\u2019s a \u2013 it is an innovative \u2013 sorry, innovative way to actually to raise capital. And so overall, we\u2019re not in the business of selling assets. But we\u2019re always looking across our portfolio and trying to figure out how to optimize the capital structure. And I think that sort of best reflects our view that the platform, the Equinix platform is critically important to all the different assets that we have in our portfolio.\nMichael Elias: Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: And our next caller is Michael Rollins with Citi. You may go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. Hi. Couple questions. First, and I realize it\u2019s still somewhat early in the year, but as you\u2019re looking forward and trying to manage power costs, what\u2019s your sense of where these power price increases or maybe future decreases are heading from what you see across the market portfolio for 2024? And then just secondly, as we take a step back and the market tries to contemplate the forward growth opportunity for Equinix, is it helpful to consider the company\u2019s position on three vectors, the percentage coverage of core global markets, the percent penetration of key customer cohorts, and where the wallet level is, especially when you break out past the top 50 customers? And is that something that you can give us a bit of an update on today?\nCharles Meyers: Sure. I\u2019ll start and Keith going to jump in here. But obviously very hard for us to predict anything on power. I would say that I would expect in general, more volatility rather than less, right? We \u2013 I think we\u2019re living in a volatile world. I think there\u2019s a lot of still dynamics at play in terms that could impact power pricing broadly speaking. And now the good news is that I think that again, we\u2019ve \u2013 this opportunity for us over the last almost year to really educate our customers about how we go about energy procurement and what it means and how it dampens volatility and why that\u2019s good for them and why it gives them budget predictability, et cetera are all things that I think have been really good for us. Obviously, you look at in sort of deregulated markets where we can hedge, we\u2019re going to dampen that volatility out. And so and again, we don\u2019t know, there definitely have been markets that have come down in price over the last several months but recognize that customers were enjoying a very different price point than what with the spot was at in sort of the latter part of 2022 and early 2023. And so they were really that was a huge benefit to them. And now some markets have moderated substantially and some people predicted they will continue to moderate further. But I think others predict, particularly in Europe, that unless we get some sort of resolution to the conflict in Ukraine that we likely have more volatility. And even I think that the fact that an energy transformation is underway in Europe under any circumstance that is going to be decade long, multi-decade long in nature, I\u2019d expect more volatility rather than less. And I think our approach to the market and how we\u2019ve approached hedging, et cetera provides real benefits. So we\u2019ll continue to sort of monitor that. I do think in some cases we\u2019re seeing some benefits in terms of power prices being a little lower than we expected in some places. We are going to have some of the hedges roll off in Q2 and we talked about that in the script. So you\u2019re going to see some elevation there. And so, that shouldn\u2019t be a surprise in the next quarter. But I definitely think it\u2019s going to continue to be a volatile overall market. Before I go to the other question, you wanted to add anything on power?\nKeith Taylor: The only other thing I would add Michael to Charles\u2019 comments, the other aspect of it is operationally we are highly focused on running the business more efficiently. We\u2019re very renewable and sustainable \u2013 sustainability focused and as a business, we want to continue to make sure we drive down the overall cost of the business. And so that\u2019s going to be an important aspect on a go forward basis. And Charles also made the comments in his prepared remarks around PPAs and our desire to go into contractual arrangement with whether it\u2019s wind or solar developers and create capacity for the market. And we see that as a bigger part of our business going forward as well. I think it sort of, it tamps down some of the volatility because it is predictable over an extended period of time at least those arrangements are. But overall, it\u2019s the combination of all those things and our commitment to a 100% renewable just as that\u2019s a critical aspect of our energy strategy as well.\nCharles Meyers: Yeah. And then Mike on the other one, I think I don\u2019t want to steal any of my thunder for Analyst Day, but I would say that I think, we\u2019ve always talked about multiple revenue or multiple growth drivers and levers in our business. Geographic expansion is one of those. So covering more markets, what\u2019s a core market that evolves and changes over time. Obviously, we continue to get a huge chunk of our bookings and profits from these sort of scaled markets. But what you see is markets start to break into that group, and they mature to a certain level. And I think we\u2019re going to continue to see that dynamic. The nature of distributed infrastructure continues to drive that. And so you\u2019re seeing hyperscalers expand their edge or their presence. They\u2019re both their edge and their core. And we want to be a partner to them in that. And so I think you\u2019ll expect us, you should expect us to see continued investment to align with that. And where the digital edge is continuing to evolve. But I do think, our commitment is to continue to be that best manifestation. And so I think we\u2019re going to continue to see geographic expansion as a driver. And then in terms of wallet share, I think it\u2019s one, we are \u2013 we\u2019re sort of a \u2013 we\u2019re an underlying provider to these companies as they scale their infrastructure. And I think that is allowing us to play in a very significant way. But then, also capturing net new markets. I think if you look at service providers, for example, the number of service providers and the life cycle from a small service provider to a scaled service provider is changing in this sort of more cloud-centric world. And so I think we\u2019re going to continue to have opportunities against both new market expansion, product line extension and new customer growth. All of those things I think are going to be drivers growth for us over time.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nOperator: And our next caller is Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks for taking the question. Yes, thanks for taking the question. So, Keith, it was good to hear in your comments, your expectation that you\u2019re going to continue to see full year churn towards the low end of the range that you\u2019ve targeted. I think to a casual observer that would sound very surprising, right? Because it\u2019s a sort of a broadly difficult macro environment. We talked here about slow down and spending on cloud and obviously you pushed through some pretty significant price increases recently. And so I was hoping you can maybe elaborate on what gives you confidence that you\u2019re going to continue to see low churn and then just maybe remind us when you do see churn, what is driving it and has that shifted at all from what you\u2019ve historically seen? Thanks.\nKeith Taylor: Yes. I think, first and foremost, it\u2019s a great question. And our confidence really comes from the fact that the team does a deep analysis into our customers. I know surprise to you, when you look at our top 10 customers, again, it\u2019s on the charts, but top 10 customers represent about 18% of our revenues. The top 50 represent about 37%, 38% of our revenues. We have a really long tail. And so we have great visibility into \u2013 particularly into our larger customers and what they\u2019re doing. So that\u2019s the first thing. The second thing is it\u2019s critical infrastructure. And it\u2019s not to suggest that companies don\u2019t struggle financially or there\u2019s consolidation or they choose to bifurcate their infrastructure choose or even just choose to do something completely different. But overall, when the majority of our growth comes from the install base and we\u2019re continuing to deliver very high quality assets with a very high operational standard around the world, we just tend not to suffer the same level of churn that we had previously. And from my point of view, it\u2019s the deep analysis of the team\u2019s done and the visibility into what we see going forward that gives us confidence that we\u2019re not going to see any meaningful churn beyond what we\u2019ve guided to. And Brett, the other \u2013 last thing I would just say that if we there\u2019s visibility to something that comes in size, we\u2019re going to telegraph it anyway. But there\u2019s just no indication that exists. And it goes back to what is the customer fundamentally doing inside our business and can the grow and scale? And that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing is those customers continue to buy more services, enter into new services, and then as we introduce new service offerings, I think it\u2019s just an enhancement or even a limiter to the amount of churn that we\u2019re going to experience as a company, because we provide alternatives. So we\u2019re not a one trick pony. So that would give, that sort of, gives you I guess, the overall sense then. Let me leave it there.\nBrett Feldman: Okay. Thank you.\nKeith Taylor: Charles, would you add anything?\nCharles Meyers: No, I mean, I think, in terms of character of the churn, I think there\u2019s a certain amount of ours that is more frictional churn associated with people evolving their footprints, how they\u2019re serving in customers. That\u2019s particularly true in network providers and some other service provider types. I think that, I think you are seeing, you are going to continue to see some level of cloud migration workloads that are well adapted to the cloud ought to go there. I always \u2013 I keep sort of reiterating that, and so I think we see some level of that, but more typical \u2013 most typically that is in the context of sort of an evolution towards a long-term hybrid multi-cloud architecture state that really plays to our strengths. And the last comment I would make is that we keep, we always say this regard to churn, the best defense against churn is getting the right opportunities to begin with. And so sales discipline and executing as I\u2019ve talked about earlier and in the script, that\u2019s really central to sort of maintaining that churn. And I think our teams have done a great job on that. And interestingly, I guess the last category I\u2019d give you when we do M&A, you find that there\u2019s often sort of a churn tale that comes from that because people underwrite to a different sort of an approach. And so, you saw that in Verizon and you look at \u2013 we now are reaping the other side of that as we\u2019ve sort of managed through that. And I\u2019ll tell you that transaction is looking super attractive, right? And so I think you see some of that comes on the back end of M&A transactions that\u2019s a sort of a third category.\nCharles Meyers: Thank you, everyone. This concludes our Q1 earnings call.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Keith Taylor",
            "content": "Thanks Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. As highlighted by Charles, we had an outstanding start to the year. As you can see from our financial results, the team delivered on multiple fronts in the quarter. We had record net bookings including power price increases. Excluding those prior price increases, our net bookings performance was solid. The result of, again, net positive pricing actions across each of our regions and lower MRR churn. Global MRR per cabinet yield increase by $124 per cabinet on an as reported basis are about $27 per cabinet adjusting per prior price increases another one-offs. And as we highlighted on the last earnings call, we completed our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet raising both debt and equity in the quarter and remain well funded to meet our future growth expectations. Now, as you would expect, despite the continued strength of our business, we remain highly focused on the broader market dynamics. But as we've stated before, during periods of disruption, Equinix thrives given our high quality and diverse set of customers who view Equinix as a mission critical partner to place their ecosystem driven digital infrastructure, whether it be a cloud on-ramp, a networking node, a cable landing station, or a trading platform. I do remember 90% of our quarterly bookings come from those existing customers as they expand their current environment or maybe move to more markets or simply buy more services. Finally, our strong liquidity position, low dividend, AFFO payout ratio and reduce debt leverage allows us to continue to invest to expand our product portfolio and expand our global footprint in both cases driving top line growth. Simply put, we're in a strong, fully funded financial position allowing us to meet all of our capital meets while maintaining the strategic and operational flexibility we need to grow and scale the business.  Now let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Know that all comments in this section are on an normalizing constant currency basis. As depicted on a Slide 4 , global Q1 revenues were $1.998 billion, up 16% over the same quarter last year, and above the top end of our guidance range due to strong recurring revenues and the timing of xScale non-recurring fees. As we've noted before, non-recurring revenues, particularly those revenues attributed to our xScale business and custom installation works are inherently lumpy and given the momentum we're seeing in our xScale business across all three regions. Non-recurring revenues could fluctuate meaningfully over the next three quarters of the year.  Q1 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $2 million tailwind when compared to our prior guidance range due to our weaker U.S. dollar in the quarter. Global Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $944 million or 47% of our revenues up 18% over the same quarter last year, and again above the top end of our guidance range due to strong operating performance including flat quarter-by-quarter SG&A spent. As expected, Q1 adjusted EBITDA benefited from lower seasonal power consumption and favorable energy hedge rates, which will reset higher starting in Q2 as anticipated, resulting in increased net utility spend over the next three quarters of the year. Q1 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges included a $2 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates and $5 million of integration costs. Global Q1 AFFO was $802 million, above our expectations due to strong business performance, including lower net interest expense and income taxes. As expected, we had seasonally lower recurring CapEx spend consistent with prior years. Q1 AFFO included a $2 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q1 MRR term was 2%, a continued reflection of our disciplined sales strategy. For the full year, we expect MRR churn to average at the low end of 2% to 2.5% of our quarterly range. Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized basis, EMEA was our fastest-growing region at 28% due to our significant power increases. Excluding the benefit attributed to those price increases, EMEA growth was 14%. Our APAC and Americas region growth rates were 15% and 9%, respectively. The Americas region had another solid quarter with strong performance from our public sector team and continued favorable pricing trends. We saw strong momentum in our Chicago, Culpeper, Seattle metros and a Brazilian business. Our EMEA business delivered a great quarter, successfully executing on our price increase program while also seeing lower-than-expected MRR churn. In the quarter, we saw bookings strength in our Amsterdam, Dublin and Manchester metros. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a solid quarter led by our Mumbai, Tokyo and Singapore markets with strong new logo additions and firm pricing. Now while Singapore remains capacity constrained as part of our IBX optimization efforts, we continue to proactively negotiate with certain customers with larger deployments to recover capacity which we anticipate to be backfilled at much higher rates, although it could affect our in-quarter MRR churn and net CapEx billing metric. And now looking at the capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our balance sheet increased to approximately $31.3 billion, including an unrestricted cash balance of $2.6 billion. Our cash balance increased quarter-over-quarter due to strong operating cash flow while we also raised approximately $580 million of yen-denominated debt and closed at the prior year's forward sales from our ATM program. Our net leverage remains low at 3.4 times our adjusted EBITDA with 96% of our outstanding debt being fixed with no near-term maturities. Given the global nature of our business, we continue to look to raise additional debt capital and reduce rate countries where we intend to expand, creating both incremental debt capital to fund our growth and placing natural hedges into these markets. Turning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $530 million, including seasonally lower recurring CapEx of $22 million. Since our last earnings call, we opened four retail projects in Frankfurt, Paris, Singapore and Sydney. We also purchased land for development in Calgary and Madrid. Revenues from owned assets were 63% of our recurring revenues for the quarter. Our capital investments delivered strong returns, as shown on Slide 10, are now 171 stabilized assets increased revenues by 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Taking out the benefit attributed to power price increases, stabilized assets increased 7% year-over-year. Consistent with prior years, in Q1, we completed the annual refresh of our IBX categorization exercise. Our stabilized asset count increased by a net 13 IBXs. Now stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested. And finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for our updated summary of 2023 guidance and bridges. Do note, all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. For the full year, we're raising our revenue guidance by $30 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance by $20 million, primarily due to favorable FX rates and lower integration costs. This guidance implies a revenue growth rate of 14% to 15%, inclusive of power price increases or 9% to 10%, excluding the power cost pass-through and adjusted EBITDA margins of 45%, excluding integration costs. We now expect to incur $33 million of integration costs in 2023. And we're raising 2023 AFFO [ph] guidance by $44 million to now grow between 10% and 13% compared to the previous year, and AFFO per share is now expected to grow 8% to 11%. 2023 CapEx is expected to range between $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, including approximately $150 million of on-balance sheet xScale spend, which we expect to be reimbursed as we transfer assets into the JVs of about $205 million of recurring CapEx spend. So let me stop here. I'm going to turn the call back to Charles. Yes, Matt, if I can just maybe add a couple of quick points to what Charles said. The other part about the leverage being a little bit lower than we typically run at it, part just because of the money that we raised and the opportunity we sort of went for us to go into the market and draw on some \u2013 particularly on the debt capital in Japan, that put more cash on our balance sheet. And so that cash is going to get consumed, but one of the things I wanted to certainly you and the rest of the listeners to walk away with is that we do have the cash. We have the flexibility both operationally and structurally, but we're going to consume the cash. And in many ways, we're paying today for one, we're fully funded for all that we see, but you look forward in time and say, well, what are we going to do in 2024 and what are we going to do in 2025. And so you're already \u2013 we're already thinking ahead and hence my comments that we want to continue to raise capital because we know our dividend, our dividend is going to grow. We know we're going to continue to spend capital and the like. And we want to have that flexibility that Charles sort of alludes to when things shake themselves free, if it makes sense for us, then we would certainly strike, and we need a good strong balance sheet. All that said, at the end of the day, we're going to consume the cash, we're going to consume it into our growth cycles. And our leverage is actually going to go up because we're measuring it on a net debt basis. And again, I just think we all like the flexibility and the liquidity we have as a company, and we can use that to our fullest advantage going forward. Thanks, Matt. Well, first, it dovetails nicely into what Charles was really talking about in the European theater, where you have a tight market, you make some decisions about looking to optimize the environment. And with that, sometimes customers move out some of the large deployments. As it relates specifically to Singapore, my reference was no different really than again, what Charles is talking about. But we do see an opportunity. There happens to be a larger installation related to customer. And it maybe it does move to a different market for us, and that would be fine. But the real focus is getting capacity in the Singapore market, getting a price uplift and again, going back to what Charles talked about, that we are sort of maybe with the bread crumbs that we see something that we're looking at right now that is going to be upsized. And of course, when we do that, it has an impact on the net cabinets billing. And of course, it has an impact on our churn metric. I maintain the word churn is going to be at the lower end of our range for the year. So I'm not worried about that. But this billing cab \u2013 billing cabinet metric is the 1 that we're always sort of looking at, causes us a little bit of discomfort because we know we're doing the right thing for the business and yet it presents itself maybe a little bit unfairly to us. And so \u2013 the bottom line is that's an initiative that we would embark upon. And Singapore is not the only market. Any place that we see that opportunity. And again, I will refer back to Charles' comment, but we don't need \u2013 where we can get an uplift an optimization of the asset. We don't have to put more capital to work and you're driving value into the equation. And so that's just a real good outcome for us. And if we can do that in places, we are tight and there is the demand, we'll make sure that we do it. Sure. Well. Thanks, David, and thanks for \u2013 laying over there. And I think, first, if you start on the red line and you look at sort of the quarter-over-quarter movement, the first thing you notice is that it is not an overly substantial increase quarter-over-quarter coming off such a big number from Q1 relative to Q4 last quarter. But one of the things you'll appreciate and those hands was built into my comments in my script, nonrecurring revenue is moving around quite a bit. And right now, we're making the underlying assumption that it's not hitting in any specific quarter. And so what you're seeing is a meaningful step down in nonrecurring revenue between Q1 and Q2. So that's the first thing. And so you feel that in many different ways, but you certainly do feel it on the EBITDA line as well. The second thing is sort of attached to that is xScale we are \u2013 as Charles alluded to in his script, we sold out on complete asset in Frankfurt, and we are very active in some \u2013 across all three regions of the world, and we anticipate a lot more xScale activity. And so you'll see that play itself out into the year or throughout the rest of the year. Right now, our MRR trends about 5% of revenue for the year. I think it's probably going to be roughly 5% of revenue. But the range is going to be somewhere between 4.2% and about 7% and between the next three quarters. And we don't know exactly where. So we haven't really guided as well as we maybe would want to given the set of circumstances. And then the last piece I'd just say, look, there's an element of conservatism built into our model here for obvious reasons. And again, we're trying to be very prudent about what we look at. We give you \u2013 we know what we did for the first quarter. We're running a little bit ahead. That was again, associated with xScale, the xScale fees. But as we look forward, we really just wanted to at this stage of the game, give you the FX and then continue to look at what's going on in the business. As it relates specifically to the power and the power costs, Again, no surprise. We've been very thoughtful about the power dynamics for this year and the power price increases. And we had to factor in and look exactly what was the cost going to be for the year, including when do the hedges roll off and when did some other start and what's going on. And in the regulatory \u2013 the regulated environment. And then there are some other markets that we are going to be putting price increases through effective on May 1, and that's Hong Kong and Tokyo. So looking at all of that, more specifically, our costs are going up. And so you're going to feel that throughout the rest of the year. It's baked into the guide already was baked into the original guide. So this isn't a shift and what you should see is really EBITDA profitability continued to increase throughout the rest of the year. So again, I think we've got a making of a really good plan here, but we're going to \u2013 we're sort of holding firm on what we hopefully shared with you when we started the year knowing that one other thing that's really working in our favor is currency. And again, we get a little bit of currency, but we're all sort of reading the same thing. If you look at what the U.S. dollar could do anywhere between now and the next 12 months, some are calling for a 5% depreciation, so we're calling as high as a 15% depreciation of the U.S. dollar and 60% of our revenues reside outside of the U.S. and you don't have to go very far to figure out what is the implication of that is 60% of our revenues move 5% or 15% before taking into consideration the hedges. You have a really substantial move on top line and on bottom line. And that drives a lot of value on a per share basis. So hopefully, that gives you sort of a full look at all the things we're thinking about and try to share with you. But at this point, we felt really comfortable just sort of holding firm on our guide and just give you a little bit of FX and some operating performance coming out of Q1. Yes. And thanks Charles. So Michael, I'll say a few things. First and foremost, we typically are not a recycler of assets. I think you have to step back and we've said this, actually one of the analyst stay, I think it was, might have been the last one, where're basically we're a platform and all assets are very important to the platform. And in particular, Hong Kong is a very important asset to us and something that is important to our platform. So we don't think about the business as selling assets, but we do also \u2013 we do think about ways \u2013 innovative ways to allow us to scale and grow the business. And an example of that is our Jakarta business, where we recently entered into our partnership with a large conglomerate so that we go into that market in tandem. And it just, it's a \u2013 it is an innovative \u2013 sorry, innovative way to actually to raise capital. And so overall, we're not in the business of selling assets. But we're always looking across our portfolio and trying to figure out how to optimize the capital structure. And I think that sort of best reflects our view that the platform, the Equinix platform is critically important to all the different assets that we have in our portfolio. The only other thing I would add Michael to Charles' comments, the other aspect of it is operationally we are highly focused on running the business more efficiently. We're very renewable and sustainable \u2013 sustainability focused and as a business, we want to continue to make sure we drive down the overall cost of the business. And so that's going to be an important aspect on a go forward basis. And Charles also made the comments in his prepared remarks around PPAs and our desire to go into contractual arrangement with whether it's wind or solar developers and create capacity for the market. And we see that as a bigger part of our business going forward as well. I think it sort of, it tamps down some of the volatility because it is predictable over an extended period of time at least those arrangements are. But overall, it's the combination of all those things and our commitment to a 100% renewable just as that's a critical aspect of our energy strategy as well. Yes. I think, first and foremost, it's a great question. And our confidence really comes from the fact that the team does a deep analysis into our customers. I know surprise to you, when you look at our top 10 customers, again, it's on the charts, but top 10 customers represent about 18% of our revenues. The top 50 represent about 37%, 38% of our revenues. We have a really long tail. And so we have great visibility into \u2013 particularly into our larger customers and what they're doing. So that's the first thing. The second thing is it's critical infrastructure. And it's not to suggest that companies don't struggle financially or there's consolidation or they choose to bifurcate their infrastructure choose or even just choose to do something completely different. But overall, when the majority of our growth comes from the install base and we're continuing to deliver very high quality assets with a very high operational standard around the world, we just tend not to suffer the same level of churn that we had previously. And from my point of view, it's the deep analysis of the team's done and the visibility into what we see going forward that gives us confidence that we're not going to see any meaningful churn beyond what we've guided to. And Brett, the other \u2013 last thing I would just say that if we there's visibility to something that comes in size, we're going to telegraph it anyway. But there's just no indication that exists. And it goes back to what is the customer fundamentally doing inside our business and can the grow and scale? And that's what we're seeing is those customers continue to buy more services, enter into new services, and then as we introduce new service offerings, I think it's just an enhancement or even a limiter to the amount of churn that we're going to experience as a company, because we provide alternatives. So we're not a one trick pony. So that would give, that sort of, gives you I guess, the overall sense then. Let me leave it there. Charles, would you add anything?"

            "name": "Charles Meyers",
            "content": "Thank you, Chip. Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We had a strong start to the year, delivering quarterly revenues right at $2 billion with adjusted EBITDA and AFFO above the top end of our expectations. Despite a challenging macro environment, customers remain committed to their digital transformation journeys, driving 4,000 deals in the quarter across more than 3,000 customers, highlighting the scale and diversity of our go-to-market engine and the broad-based demand that continues to propel the business. We continue to see enterprises and service providers build out their IT infrastructure on Platform Equinix. And that infrastructure is more distributed, more cloud connected and more hybrid than ever before. And while some customers are appropriately cautious about the timing of their investments given macro conditions, Equinix continues to be a critical partner in their efforts to advance hybrid architectures, unlock digital performance gains and optimize cloud and network spend. As a result, our deal win rates remain steady compared to historical trends, and we continue to see a robust pricing environment across all three regions. Turning to power. We're very pleased with how the organization has navigated a volatile energy market and we remain in a strong position, significantly mitigating the impacts of this volatility for our business and for our customers. As previously discussed, we raised pricing in January to more than 7,000 customers across 16 countries, generating approximately $90 million of incremental revenue in the quarter, fully offsetting the impact of higher power costs. Thanks to timely and transparent communications, concessions and disputes are low and our days of sales outstanding remain in line with historical trends. On the sustainability front, we are committed to responsible growth and continue to advance our bold future first sustainability agenda. Sustainability is increasingly becoming a board-level issue and Gartner estimates that by 2026, 75% of organizations will seek to increase business with IT vendors that have demonstrable sustainability goals and timelines, and we'll seek to replace those who don't. We recently published our eighth annual CSR report. And in 2022, we extended our industry leadership with 96% renewable energy coverage, making our fifth consecutive year with over 90% coverage. We're also progressing well on our science-based targets with a 23% reduction in operational emissions across Scope 1 and Scope 2 from our 2019 baseline. Additionally, Equinix continues to evolve its power procurement portfolio to increase the quality of its renewable energy purchases. This year, we signed new long-term power purchase agreements for solar projects in Spain totaling 345 megawatts of capacity, bringing Equinix's contracted renewable energy PPA portfolio to 715 megawatts globally once fully operational. Looking forward, where feasible, we'll continue to prioritize projects that create new sources of clean energy directly in the grids where we operate and support a healthy renewable energy coverage mix. Turning to our results. As depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q1 were $2 billion, up 16% year-over-year, driven by strong recurring revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA was up 18% year-over-year, and AFFO was better than our expectations due to strong operating performance. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our unmatched scale and reach continues to differentiate our data center services portfolio and the tremendous strength of our balance sheet positions us to sustain our investment in new capacity to support a robust demand environment. We currently have 50 major projects underway across 37 metros in 25 countries, including 10x scale projects that will deliver more than 90 megawatts of capacity once opened. This quarter, we added new data center builds in Lagos, Frankfurt and Rio de Janeiro. Revenues from multi-region and three region customers increased 1% quarter-over-quarter to an impressive 76% and 65%, respectively. Key multi-region wins in the quarter included a Fortune 500 manufacturing conglomerate, expanding its Performance Hub deployments across all three regions to assist with a business unit divestiture and in Cloud Native Zero Trust cybersecurity company using Equinix Metal to expand its business across all three regions. Our platform remains the logical point of Nexus for hybrid and multi-cloud deployments and hyperscalers continue to look to Equinix as a critical infrastructure provider and a valued go-to-market partner. This quarter, we won five new cloud on-ramps across Milan, Mumbai, Muscat, Tokyo and Warsaw as we continue to enjoy a strong leadership position in multi-cloud connectivity compared to our closest competitors. We're also seeing the unique breadth of our product portfolio across retail colo, interconnection services, xScale and digital services resonate strongly with customers as they embrace rapidly emerging opportunities in AI. We've closed several key AI wins over the past few quarters and are seeing a growing pipeline of new opportunities directly and with key partners for both training and inference use cases that benefit from the unique performance characteristics and multi-cloud proximity of our platform. In our xScale portfolio, we continue to see strong overall demand. In Q1, we pre-leased our entire Frankfurt 16 asset representing 14 megawatts of capacity taking us to over 75% leased or pre-leased across our nearly 260 megawatts of operational and announced xScale facilities. And we have a strong funnel of additional xScale opportunities in the coming quarters. Enterprise to cloud wins this quarter included a leading consumer products company leveraging Equinix's robust ecosystems for their private multi-cloud connectivity needs and the Hearst Corporation, a diversified media company deploying on platform Equinix to execute its cloud first strategy, including the deployment of network edge for their network aggregation. Turning to our industry leading interconnection business, we now have over 452,000 total interconnections on our platform. In Q1, interconnection revenue stepped up 12% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. And we added an incremental 5,300 interconnections for the quarter. We saw some continued grooming activity and consolidation into higher bandwidth BCs on Fabric, but both moderated from the prior quarter. While gross ads remain strong, pricing is firm and the diversity of our customer interconnection continues to expand.  As global data volumes continue to accelerate, internet exchange saw peak traffic up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 26% year-over-year to greater than 30 terabits per second for the first time. And as enterprises continue to embrace hybrid and multi-cloud as their architecture of choice, they're increasingly seeking the security performance and convenience of Equinix Fabric to connect to their choice of cloud and IT services across the broader digital ecosystem. One example is Cisco whose multiple edge delivered services now rank among the leading end destinations on Fabric. Customer wins included Caixa, Brazil's federal financial services company partnering with Equinix to accelerate its business by optimizing and securing its network core via Fabric. We also continue to enhance our platform with our digital services portfolio and saw a strong new user growth for our Equinix Metal offering as we cultivate product like growth. Wins this quarter included a Japanese video game company utilizing Equinix Metal in all three regions to support a new product launch and restack an Australian SaaS integrator and managed services provider utilizing Equinix Fabric and our edge services to optimize their solution offerings. Our channel program delivered another strong quarter accounting for roughly 35% of bookings and 60% of new logos. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and digital first-use cases with strong engagement across the hyperscalers and continued momentum with partners like AT&T, Dell, Cisco, HPE, Orange business and Zenlayer. Key wins included a digital modernization win with Entel, our largest local partner in Chile, on behalf of Empresa Nacional [indiscernible] at Chile and oil and gas company. Entel is delivering a fully managed SDYM [ph] solution based upon Cisco technology while leveraging Equinix data center and interconnection services demonstrating how local partners can help deliver value to clients in new Equinix markets. Now let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results for the quarter. Thanks, Keith. In closing, we had a solid start to the year. While we remain vigilant to the challenges in the broader macro economy. Our Q1 results were strong and our outlook remains positive with the overall demand for digital transformation, fueling our conviction around the long-term secular drivers of our business. We look forward to our upcoming Analyst Day in June where we will further outline the significant opportunity ahead and discuss our strongly differentiated position in capturing this opportunity as we enable our customers to access all the right places, partners and possibilities. We also look forward to diving more deeply into our evolving platform capabilities, our industry-leading go-to-market engine and sharing expectations of how all of this will translate into durable and differentiated value creation for our investors, our customers and the communities in which we operate. So let me stop there and open it up for questions. Thanks, Matt. Yes. Look, I think overall, as we said in the script, I think we continue to feel good about the demand level. I think definitely, customers are feeling tighter budgets, looking to stretch their dollars. But I think their commitment to digital is strong. And I think how they're using us in terms of looking to capture savings in a variety of areas. And again, long-term digital transformation equipments are driving pretty solid activity levels. So I think the overall, we did about 4,000 deals in the quarter of 3,000 customers, very much in line with kind of what we've done in prior quarters. Linearity was pretty good. And so we probably saw a few more deals slip into the following quarter than we would have in previous quarters. And then on sales cycle, just to give you more of a concrete data point to hang your hat on, we usually see about 45% - I'm sorry, about 40% of our deals extend beyond the 90-day sales cycle. And that rose in this last quarter to about 45%. So a little bit of an increase, but not particularly material. And as we saw a little bit of slippage, actually our linearity in Q2 is already looking pretty good. So we started with a little bit richer funnel and so we're off to a good start in Q2. So again, I think that clearly, you're feeling a little bit of caution in the macro market, but overall, I think in terms of what people are \u2013 how they're thinking about digital, how they're thinking about Equinix in that context, we continue to see a pretty good overall environment. Relative to your second question on capital allocation, look, our balance sheet, thanks to our team's efforts, is in a really good place. And as I've said in a number of settings, I do think there's going to be opportunities for us, both organically and inorganic, I don't think we're starting to see, I think, some softening in multiples. And I think that's likely to continue depending on kind of overall sort of recessionary sort of dynamics and that kind of thing. And so we'll keep an eye on that. I do think as a market leader and we've got a long track record of being able to unlock value from M&A, and we're definitely positioned to do that if the right things come along. And so I do think that we probably expect some capital allocation towards that. And I think our balance sheet puts us in a really good position. Keith, anything to add there? Yes. Great question, Jon. So on stabilized growth, obviously, incredible results fueled, obviously, in part by PPI on the power price increase. So 11% is definitely really high. If you take out the effects of power price increase, that still takes you down to about 7%, so really attractive. And if you take out the new stabilized assets, which are obviously less mature and probably growing faster than others, take \u2013 we take it down to about 5% from the previous sort of portfolio of stabilized assets. So that's still at the high end of the 3% to 5% that we've been talking about. But this is pretty typical of the dynamic as you very well know, when you add in sort of a new set of stabilized assets sort of [indiscernible] the growth a little bit up. And then as you increase utilization and sort of tap out that growth, it might tend to sort of come back down a little bit. And then ROIC goes a little bit in the opposite direction. It's sort of impaired by the fact that these are less mature, but then I think we would tend to rise back. And so overall, we feel really good about stabilized assets. And I think they are a reflection of the strength of the business model. Billable cabs, yes, for sure, definitely good solid quarter in Americas. APAC is coming off a really strong quarter last quarter and so it was flat this one, EMEA actually had sort of no meaningful adds the last couple of quarters. And I know that creates a little sort of mental distance for people to see a couple of quarters without billable cabs. But I think it's important to remember that really the dynamics of the business as such. In EMEA, actually, if you look at eight quarter, 12 quarter trend, we've actually had a lot of strength there in terms of cabinet adds and you get into a situation where essentially you start seeing high utilization rates in certain markets Therefore, you're probably going to see a little less large footprint and then you actually start sort of a cycle of looking for good churn to try to make room. And that kind of \u2013 can lead to some flat spots, I think, from billable caps. But we always encourage people to really look at a longer-term trend. We clearly will grow can will and need to grow billable cabs across all three regions. And with the size of the development pipeline that we have, that will happen. But let me give you just a data point on Europe, one of the things \u2013 this happened in Europe, and it gives \u2013 I think it's something to sort of hang your hat on and really reinforce why we talk so much about our strategy and maintaining discipline in our strategy because we could turn ourselves into cabinet fingers and that's really not what we want. And so if you look at Europe, we actually had a churn this quarter in a market that is very tight about 440 cabs. And that was \u2013 it was a pretty low dense implementation from a power density standpoint and not really well interconnected. And so we were getting a cabinet yield there well below our average. When we go to resell that, we will likely resell that in significantly more small to midsized deals than sort of one big footprint. And when you look at what's likely to happen there, we're probably going to increase the revenue and therefore, the yield per cabinet, when you get more interconnection, higher power density and a higher price point, we'll probably increase the revenue from those 440 cabs, 50% from that capacity when all is said and done. And so the significant growth with no billable \u2013 essentially zero increase in billable cabs and no incremental CapEx. And so this is why when you hear us talk constantly about right customer, right application, right assets. And that's more than just a sort of a clever thing for the earnings call. That's a way of life here in terms of how we drive our sales team. And I think that gives you kind of a good reflection. So you will see the billable cab growth, but I think right now, you're seeing good healthy growth across those because I think we're playing every lever, power density, price point, interconnection, and I think it's really driving health in the business. Yes. I think it's a little early to tell, but we have seen \u2013 it's interesting because ChatGPT has created a media frenzy around AI. But the reality is we've seen AI-related opportunities in our pipeline for the last several years. And for those that are familiar with the story and out on the investor circuit with us, you've heard me talk about that. And I think that most typically, it is people thinking about how to use their data and where to place their data. And what we're seeing is actually a trend towards people saying, we want to take our data and place it sort of inter cloud. We want to have control of that data. We want to intersect it with other data sources and we want to be able to move it into and out of clouds as appropriate for these things. And so we have seen some large training model training opportunities. Those are partially economically driven just it's actually cheaper to do on sort of dedicated hardware. If you have sort of a sustained commitment to doing AI training. And so we've seen some of those. And then inference deals, which I think are going to be a bit more interconnected, are where people are actually deploying inference AI inference use cases that are sort of \u2013 and I think we're going to be uniquely well suited is when insights are both, one, when data sets are dynamic and they're updated frequently, and they're taking in a lot of new data. And secondly, where insights are real-time and mission-critical. I think \u2013 and that really doesn't sort of fit the profile of the way current large language models like ChatGPT are being used. But we do think that what's going to happen is people are going to build vertically oriented sort of AI use cases on top of foundational models that are going to be sort of cloud-centric. And I think that we're going to be well suited to responding to some of those opportunities. So I think it's going to be a mix. I actually think some of the training stuff, Jonathan, is going to be more suited to our xScale portfolio. And I think some of the inference stuff is probably going to land in the retail portfolio at the digital edge. And so that's sort of the current dynamic, but early days, but I think an exciting incremental opportunity, and we're going to talk a little bit more about that at Analyst Day. Yes. Nick, I'd offer a little bit more color in that saying, we have a few examples where I think we have footprints that probably would have been better suited to xScale facilities had we had them at the time that we took them that now we are sort of saying, hey, that we would really need that capacity for \u2013 to fuel the retail footprint. And obviously, in Singapore, there's a broader sort of capacity constraint concern, it's really critical that we recapture those. And so \u2013 but there are other \u2013 other markets where I think we see some of that opportunity and other markets in which some of these capacity constraints might come into play. It's also one of the reasons why I think we have to continue to lean in on sustainability. And the connection between those things is, I think, for us to make sure we're going to be in line to get the power allocations needed, the permits needed, et cetera, to continue to drive capacity in markets where jurisdictions are quite reasonably looking at how to manage their energy needs. I think it's going to be important that we are able to say, hey, we're the responsible party to partner with to continue to be a digital leader but be that in a really responsible way. So a lot of sort of interconnections between those various thoughts and threats. Absolutely. Yes, as I noted, there's a few on the last call and in the script, there's a few factors that play out interconnection. Overall, one thing I'd say is traffic levels continue to be really attractive. You're seeing that in exchange. You're seeing that in terms of in fabric overall provision capacity. It's a little tougher for us to tell on physical cross-connects, exactly how much traffic is flowing because we don't \u2013 we don't like the electronics on those things. But it's fair to say that \u2013 I think what you're seeing is a trend towards significantly higher speeds to support higher and higher traffic. And by the way, I think AI is going to only add fuel to that fire. So gross adds have been strong. That's one of the things that we really look at is say, how many gross adds are there. And I think that's a primary indicator of health, and those have been very much in line with the four quarter averages. There is some grooming activity. As I said last quarter, we thought that would moderate \u2013 it did moderate to some degree, but was still there at an elevated level. I do think people are going to run out of low-hanging fruit on that one. And so I think that we'll eventually see more moderation there, and that will help the net adds further. I think this trend towards higher speeds, though is a more sustained trend. And so I think we're just going to have to look at kind of how \u2013 where things settle out. We've seen this in the past where traffic is sort of catching up to provision capacity a little bit. And so \u2013 but again, I think the long-term trend here is very high degrees of traffic flow, higher degrees of interconnection. The diversity we're seeing in the interconnection system and ecosystem is increasingly rich. So more a [indiscernible] sort of unique connections. And overall, just the strength is good. So 12% revenue growth a little lighter on the unit side. I do think we'll see some more moderation of the grooming per se, but I do think that that will be offset that we'll still see a little bit more in terms of fewer higher speed circuits. And so we'll just \u2013 we'll continue to track that. But I'll give you the punch line here. Interconnection is well north of $1 billion business for us, growing at 12% at very, very attractive returns on capital. And I think that the opportunity for us to continue to sort of lean into that and grow that business, particularly as we grow fabric. And as we think about what the bigger cloud networking opportunity looks like and what our role in it is \u2013 continues to be a big part of the Equinix story. Lots in there. So let me try to hit them all. So yes, pricing is definitely firm. Obviously, PPIs have gotten a lot of airtime, but I think perhaps an even more important trend is our ability to sort of sustain pricing power on sort of the broader portfolio of service offerings. And so we have elevated our costs on space, power and interconnection from a list price perspective across all our markets. And so I think you're going to see that continuing to sort of roll into the business. xScale pricing has definitely firmed in across the world. And so I think we're seeing attractive price points and good solid cash and cash returns on the product projects that we're underwriting. And as we said, we got a very high degree of pre-leasing there. And so \u2013 and again, we've raised pricing both on the retail side, space, power and on the interconnection units. So we have \u2013 and then you have the escalators and we are \u2013 our escalators are also going up. And so in some cases, we're doing CPI or other index-based escalators, but then more broadly, if we're doing fixed escalators, they are much higher than they have been in the past. And so I think we're seeing all of that roll through as a clear dynamic in the business in terms of and you're seeing it show up in MRR per cap, right? I mean, we gave you a headline stat there and keep script about how MRR per cab is increasing. Yes, a big chunk of it due to PPI. But even absent that, I think our yield per cab, which is an absolutely critical metric for us continues to rise. So \u2013 and then on metal, we talked a couple about a couple of really nice wins. We are really cultivating early users in what is more of a product-led growth motion that's probably a little bit more typical of SaaS providers. And so we're cutting our teeth on that to be candid, but we're getting the hang of it. And we are seeing some uptake from developers and from started digitally native service providers. And we're also seeing some pretty big opportunities in our funnel about more traditional service providers or large enterprises looking to reduce the pain of managing the technology life cycle and metal really helps with that. So we'll probably talk more about that at the Analyst Day as well. But goes continue to feel good about the underlying drivers of that business and kind of why we did that acquisition in the first place. Yes. Maybe Dave, a little bit of more color is that I think \u2013 I will tell you that we are also focused on every element of the business model. So if you look at the revenue line, say, P times Q, we feel very good about P, continue to feel good about Q and we're going to continue to work the heck out of that. I would say that at the next sort of a click down on cost of goods, we're continuing to drive efficiency sort of projects across the business to try to improve cost of goods and gross margin.  Then when you look down further, I also think just given the broader \u2013 we're going to continue to be diligent on spent. We did spend \u2013 we opened up the wallet a bit to make sure we can add some more headcount, and we're trying to bring them up productivity as quickly as possible. But you saw a flat SG&A spend quarter-over-quarter, and we're going to continue to be very disciplined about that as well. And so, we're going to work every element of the model and continue to do what we need to do to try to deliver the long-term performance. Yes. Why don't we \u2013 I'll take the first one and then Keith can comment on the second one there relative to Hong Kong. But on M&A as I said, I do think there's opportunities for us. We've talked about where some of those markets might be. I think Southeast Asia is going to continue to be an area of opportunity, we believe over time. And there's several key markets there that I think we've got our eyes on. We've actually done a couple of organic projects already in Indonesia and Malaysia, and we're going to continue to stay sort of eyes very wide open in terms of opportunities for us in that area. India, we've announced a new build in Chennai, but I do think there's a lot of opportunity in India, and I think that could be a combination over time of organic and inorganic. And I think that we also I think one of the things that we have not done a lot of, or we haven't done any of it yet, but I think that could be on radar, is thinking about opportunities from an xScale perspective in partnership with our partners. All of those probably represent some level of opportunity for us M&A and I think as we look at some of the dynamics and opportunities in the market, including AI. I think that could be those could be all very relevant for us. So that's the first question, and then I'll let \u2013 I'll kick it over to Keith and he can talk a bit about the \u2013 this capital recycling question. Sure. I'll start and Keith going to jump in here. But obviously very hard for us to predict anything on power. I would say that I would expect in general, more volatility rather than less, right? We \u2013 I think we're living in a volatile world. I think there's a lot of still dynamics at play in terms that could impact power pricing broadly speaking. And now the good news is that I think that again, we've \u2013 this opportunity for us over the last almost year to really educate our customers about how we go about energy procurement and what it means and how it dampens volatility and why that's good for them and why it gives them budget predictability, et cetera are all things that I think have been really good for us. Obviously, you look at in sort of deregulated markets where we can hedge, we're going to dampen that volatility out. And so and again, we don't know, there definitely have been markets that have come down in price over the last several months but recognize that customers were enjoying a very different price point than what with the spot was at in sort of the latter part of 2022 and early 2023. And so they were really that was a huge benefit to them. And now some markets have moderated substantially and some people predicted they will continue to moderate further. But I think others predict, particularly in Europe, that unless we get some sort of resolution to the conflict in Ukraine that we likely have more volatility. And even I think that the fact that an energy transformation is underway in Europe under any circumstance that is going to be decade long, multi-decade long in nature, I'd expect more volatility rather than less. And I think our approach to the market and how we've approached hedging, et cetera provides real benefits. So we'll continue to sort of monitor that. I do think in some cases we're seeing some benefits in terms of power prices being a little lower than we expected in some places. We are going to have some of the hedges roll off in Q2 and we talked about that in the script. So you're going to see some elevation there. And so, that shouldn't be a surprise in the next quarter. But I definitely think it's going to continue to be a volatile overall market. Before I go to the other question, you wanted to add anything on power? Yeah. And then Mike on the other one, I think I don't want to steal any of my thunder for Analyst Day, but I would say that I think, we've always talked about multiple revenue or multiple growth drivers and levers in our business. Geographic expansion is one of those. So covering more markets, what's a core market that evolves and changes over time. Obviously, we continue to get a huge chunk of our bookings and profits from these sort of scaled markets. But what you see is markets start to break into that group, and they mature to a certain level. And I think we're going to continue to see that dynamic. The nature of distributed infrastructure continues to drive that. And so you're seeing hyperscalers expand their edge or their presence. They're both their edge and their core. And we want to be a partner to them in that. And so I think you'll expect us, you should expect us to see continued investment to align with that. And where the digital edge is continuing to evolve. But I do think, our commitment is to continue to be that best manifestation. And so I think we're going to continue to see geographic expansion as a driver. And then in terms of wallet share, I think it's one, we are \u2013 we're sort of a \u2013 we're an underlying provider to these companies as they scale their infrastructure. And I think that is allowing us to play in a very significant way. But then, also capturing net new markets. I think if you look at service providers, for example, the number of service providers and the life cycle from a small service provider to a scaled service provider is changing in this sort of more cloud-centric world. And so I think we're going to continue to have opportunities against both new market expansion, product line extension and new customer growth. All of those things I think are going to be drivers growth for us over time. No, I mean, I think, in terms of character of the churn, I think there's a certain amount of ours that is more frictional churn associated with people evolving their footprints, how they're serving in customers. That's particularly true in network providers and some other service provider types. I think that, I think you are seeing, you are going to continue to see some level of cloud migration workloads that are well adapted to the cloud ought to go there. I always \u2013 I keep sort of reiterating that, and so I think we see some level of that, but more typical \u2013 most typically that is in the context of sort of an evolution towards a long-term hybrid multi-cloud architecture state that really plays to our strengths. And the last comment I would make is that we keep, we always say this regard to churn, the best defense against churn is getting the right opportunities to begin with. And so sales discipline and executing as I've talked about earlier and in the script, that's really central to sort of maintaining that churn. And I think our teams have done a great job on that. And interestingly, I guess the last category I'd give you when we do M&A, you find that there's often sort of a churn tale that comes from that because people underwrite to a different sort of an approach. And so, you saw that in Verizon and you look at \u2013 we now are reaping the other side of that as we've sort of managed through that. And I'll tell you that transaction is looking super attractive, right? And so I think you see some of that comes on the back end of M&A transactions that's a sort of a third category. Thank you, everyone. This concludes our Q1 earnings call."

At this time, I'll turn the call over to Adaire.\nAdaire Fox-Martin: Thank you. Chip Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We had an outstanding quarter. We delivered record growth bookings with strong performance across each of our three regions. We had solid deal conversion rates and pricing remained robust. Cabinets billing increased meaningfully. All of this translated into our 87th quarter of consecutive revenue growth with attractive AFFO per share profitability, highlighting the scale and differentiation that reinforces our market position. Importantly, given the robust demand for digital infrastructure to enable AI capabilities across industries and regions, our forward-looking pipeline remains strong with healthy pre sales activities supporting our momentum in Q4 and beyond. Turning to our strategy, as I discussed last quarter, Equinix has developed a differentiated and successful business over the last two and a half decades, creating exceptional value for our customers and our shareholders. Our strength is underpinned by our position as the world's leading digital infrastructure company, our truly global footprint and scale, our neutrality and our singular value proposition around interconnection. However, we recognize that our industry landscape is dynamic and increasingly complex. Customer requirements and data center designs are evolving rapidly. Energy constraints and long-term development cycles pose challenges to our industry's ability to serve customers effectively. Equinix is particularly well positioned to address these challenges as an industry leader to seize the significant opportunities ahead and drive future growth. To this end, we will focus on three strategic areas built on the tenets I shared on last quarter's earnings call of clarity, simplicity and focus. First, we will start outside in with our customers. We will focus on enhancing how we engage with our customers at every milestone in our relationship with them. Our goal is to be the partner of choice for our customer\u2019s most critical infrastructure workloads. To achieve this, we intend to evolve our go-to-market engine in a structured and coordinated manner to deliver a frictionless customer experience that is segment appropriate. We have already seen the benefit of solution and segment focus in our record Q3 gross bookings outcome. Second, we will deliver integrated solutions that make it easier for our customers and partners to deploy and consume solutions at Equinix. Our initial efforts will focus on developing smarter solutions that extend our core co-location and interconnection offerings. This is where we have the right to win and the right to lead. In support of this, we have brought together our data center services team and our digital services team into a single business area led by Jon Lin. Third, we have been innovating in data center design and our approach to data center construction. We are fortunate to have industry leading procurement, design and construction teams. We intend to build for the future and accelerate our development of differentiated campuses that support the broad range of our customer\u2019s needs. Essentially, this means moving from many smaller builds with phased capacity delivery to fewer larger bills, balancing location with access to power on campuses that can service the full range of our customer\u2019s needs from SMEs to hyperscalers. At the same time, we will remain focused on delivering industry leading investment returns by continuing to meet the evolving needs of our customers, placing the right application into the right footprint for the best business outcome. Taken together, I believe these strategic moves which are about doing less so that we can deliver more, will drive significant long-term value for our customers, partners and shareholders. We continue to invest in the market opportunities we believe lie ahead. Earlier this month we announced our plans to nearly triple the investment capital of our xScale program with the agreement to form a greater than 15 billion joint venture with the CPP Investment Board and GIC. With the capital raised through this new JV, Equinix expects to build new state of the art xScale facilities on multiple campuses across the U.S. each with the capacity of multiple hundreds of megawatts. As discussed previously, we've already closed on land and power for a 240 megawatt xScale campus in Atlanta which we expect to contribute to this new JV. We are currently in active diligence to secure power and land in additional U.S. markets and look forward to providing more details in the coming quarters. Since our last earnings call in our established JVs, we have leased an incremental 20 megawatts in our SOL 2 [ph] data center. This brings total xScale leasing to 385megawatts globally with nearly 90% of our operational and under construction capacity leased. We believe Equinix is uniquely positioned to innovate with and for hyperscalers and we are excited about the opportunities ahead. Enterprise demand is steadily building for AI related workloads. We remain the preferred location for server provider onramps supporting the data ingestion and distribution requirements of AI workloads. Equinix customers can enjoy low latency access to native hyperscaler on ramps in 47 metros across 25 countries. This includes 12 metros with onramps to five or more providers. This is six times the coverage of our nearest competitor. Recent key service provider wins and production use cases include Nebius, a full stack AI infrastructure provider. Their new deployment in Paris will be among the first in Europe to offer NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs in support of providing essential resources for customer AI journeys. Sakura Internet, a Japanese cloud service provider is actively involved in the development of large scale cloud services for generative AI and aims to enhance its GPU based cloud services to explore new business opportunities in Asia. For Enterprise AI, Equinix is supporting our Fortune 200 shipping and logistics company who deployed at Equinix to unlock predictive capabilities in logistics and build intelligent data driven supply chains. We are also supporting a leading med tech company who is leveraging AI algorithms to analyze endoscopic images in real time. This will save lives through enhancing diagnostic precision. Our unique business model enables us to serve the full spectrum of our customers AI requirements. Our retail footprint is well positioned to serve the inferencing and private AI workloads of enterprises of varying sizes. Our rapidly expanding xScale offering can meet the significant requirements of hyperscalers and service providers. Our ability to satisfy these needs fortifies our resilience in capturing upside and managing potential downside in a highly dynamic and evolving AI landscape. Turning to our results, as depicted on slide 3 Q3 revenues were 2.2 billion, up 7% over the same quarter last year driven by strong recurring revenue growth and xScale fees. Adjusted EBITDA was up 12% year-over-year with solid AFFO per share profitability. Interconnection revenues increased 10% year-over-year with continued strength from Equinix Fabric. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Fueling our industry leading global interconnection franchise we now have 478,000 total interconnections deployed across our footprint. Growth Interconnection additions remain strong and pricing continues to trend favorably. Net interconnection additions improved to 5,700 due to strong increase in hyperscale across connects and the continued diversification of our ecosystems. Equinix Fabric saw continued solid growth and is now operating at an annual revenue run rate of greater than US$250 million with an attach rate of approximately 40% across our global customer base. Our fabric business grew thanks to 100 gigabit port editions and higher bandwidth virtual connections. Equinix Internet Exchange saw peak traffic surpass 40 terabits per second for the first time. In August we opened our first data center in Johannesburg to support the growing digital infrastructure and connectivity needs of enterprises and service providers in the rapidly growing African continent. We also opened the first phases of our New York 3 and Tokyo 15 IBXs this quarter, easing capacity constraints in two of our key metros. Customers taking advantage of our expanding global footprint include PubMatic, a digital advertising firm who expanded their partnership with Equinix to leverage AI powered predictive analytics for their ad campaigns. SaaS provider Zoho chose Equinix so they could better support their customers in complying with European data sovereignty requirements. Our channel program delivered another solid quarter contributing approximately 50% of new logos. We continued to see growth from partners like Avant, Dell, Orange Business and WWT with wins across a wide range of industry segments and use cases including AI. Q3 wins include a data center modernization project with AT&T. Together we helped a customer experience technology company blend cloud and private infrastructure resources, enable multi cloud networking and accelerate AI and automation enhancements for customer interactions. We believe this quarter is a testament to the trust our customers place in us and the value they realize from partnering strategically with us. With that, I'll turn it over to Keith to cover the quarter's financials.\nKeith Taylor: Thanks Adaire and good afternoon to everyone. Let me start by saying we once again delivered another strong quarter. The business continues to execute against its short term goals, another step in our journey while setting the stage for the years ahead. We finished the quarter with record gross bookings with each of our regions at or very near their all-time highs. Our net bookings were also very strong with net megawatts sold in our core business up 60% over the previous quarter, a reflection of the growth and density of our bookings activity. Additionally, we pre- sold a meaningful amount of future capacity which is neither included in our bookings nor our backlog metrics. We closed more than 4,100 deals with more than 3,200 customers and our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO were at the high end of our expectations, the result of solid revenue growth and disciplined cost management. As it relates to our non financial metrics, we saw meaningful improvements across net billable cabinets and interconnections and higher NMR per cabinet. Net billable cabinet stepped up by 3,100 globally driven by strong bookings and capacity openings in certain key markets. Given our record Q3 gross bookings and our elevated backlog of cabinets sold but not yet installed, we expect our net billable cabinet additions to remain strong through the end of the year. Net interconnection additions had a healthy step up as our gross interconnection activity remains at its highest level. Interconnection revenues increased to 19% of recurring revenues. Our MRR per cabinet metric continues to trend favorably, increasing 6% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis to over $2,300 per cabinet, driven by favorable pricing environments and increasing power densities. In the quarter, the average cabinet booked had an average density of 6.2 kilowatts per cabinet, while the density of our turn cabinets was 4 kilowatts per cabinet. As Adaire highlighted, we're excited about the next phase of our xScale initiative. The announcement of our greater than $15 billion joint venture with CPP, IB and GIC is another milestone for Equinix. We continue to believe this off balance sheet joint venture structure will enable us to serve the significant needs of our largest customers for both traditional cloud and emerging AI workloads while delivering significant value to our investors on a per share basis. Bottom line, given the strength of our balance sheet, including our low debt leverage and strategic and operational liquidity alongside the xScale partnerships, we believe that Equinix represents the best opportunity to create value in the digital infrastructure space. Now let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on slide 4, global Q3 revenues were $2.201 billion, up 7% over the same quarter last year at the midpoint of our guidance range due to the deferral of planned xScale fees into 2025. For Q4, our revenue guidance implies a meaningful step up in non-recurring revenues related to xScale fit out activities and other sales activity. Net of our FX hedges, there was a minimal FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 adjusted EBITDA was 1.048 billion or approximately 48% of revenues, up 12% over the same quarter last year at the top end of our guidance range due to strong operating performance. Q3 adjusted EBITDA net of our FX hedges included a $1 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and included $2 million of integration costs. Global Q3 FFO was 866 million, up 12% over the same quarter last year, better than our expectation due to strong operating performance, favorable net interest expense and the timing of our Singapore 6 land lease payment. Q3AFFO included a minimal FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 MRR Churn was lower than planned due to the Deferral of forecasted MRR Churn from late September into early October. As such, when we averaged the expected quarterly churn over the second half of the year, we expect MRR Churn to be in the middle of our 2% to 2.5% quarterly guidance range. Turning to our regional highlights whose full results are covered on slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized basis, APAC was our fastest growing region at 15%, followed by the Americas and EMEA regions growing at 6% and 3% respectively. Excluding the impact of par price actions, APAC grew 17% and EMEA grew 5%. The Americas region delivered very strong bookings across many of our Tier one metros including Dallas, New York, Silicon Valley and Washington DC. Demand continues to outpace supply in top markets driving a favorable pricing environment. Our new business also delivered a great quarter with record gross bookings activity, firm pricing and robust AI deal activity led by our Dubai, Frankfurt, London and Paris metros. We also had healthy activity in our growth in emerging market metros as global scale and reach continue to be a point of differentiation for our business. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a great quarter with near record gross bookings and strong inter-region activity resulting in quarterly revenues reaching the $500 million milestone for the very first time. We experienced continued momentum in our Hong Kong, Osaka, Singapore and Tokyo markets including significant AI demand in Japan for service provider, enterprise and government use cases. And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our balance sheet increased to approximately $35.4 billion including elevated cash and short term investments of $3.2 billion ahead of our $1 billion maturing bond payment in November. In the quarter, we issued more than 750 million in senior green bonds across our Euro and Swiss franc offerings as we continue to align our financings across our investing markets while supporting our Future for Sustainability strategy. To date, Equinix has issued approximately 5.6 billion of green bonds, making our company one of the top 10 largest U.S. investment grade corporate issuers in the green bond market. Additionally, we settled both Forward and spot ATM activity of approximately 975 million in the quarter. We plan to continue to take a balanced and opportunistic approach to accessing the capital markets as and when market conditions are favorable to fund our future growth, including future capital commitment purchases. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter, capital expenditures were $724 million, including recurring CapEx of $69 million, a $24 million increase over the prior quarter. As planned, we have 57 major projects underway in 35 markets across 22 countries, including 13 xScale projects. This represents more than 22,000 cabinets of retail and more than 100 megawatts of xScale capacity to be delivered through 2025. We opened seven major projects in the quarter across seven metros including new data centers in Johannesburg, Istanbul, New York and Tokyo. We also purchased land for development in Amsterdam and Bangkok as we continue to expand our footprint across South East Asia. More than 85% of our current retail expansion spend is on our own land, our own buildings with long-term ground leases. Our capital investments deliver strong returns as shown on Slide 10, our 180 stabilized assets increase revenues by 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis excluding the impact of prior price actions. Stabilized assets were collectively 84% utilized and generated a 26% cash-on-cash return on the gross PPE invested. And finally, please refer to slides 11 through 15 for our updated summary of 2024 guidance and bridges. Do note, all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. For the full year we're raising our revenue guidance by $36 million and our adjusted EBITDA guidance by $10 million due to strong bookings, performance and favorable FX rates. This guidance implies a top line growth rate of 7% to 8%. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be about 47% which includes the acceleration of certain costs into Q3 and Q4. We're also raising our full year AFFO guidance by $18 million and now 11% to 13% increase over the previous year primarily due to operating performance and favorable net interest expense and does include the acceleration of costs into Q3 and Q4. AFFO per share is expected to now grow between 9% and 10% at the top end of our guidance range. And finally, our full year CapEx is expected to range between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion, including about $240 million of recurring CapEx spend. So let me stop here and I'm going to turn the call back to Adaire.\nAdaire Fox-Martin: Thank you Keith. In closing, we had a great third quarter, achieving record growth bookings and delivering robust performance across key financial and non financial metrics. We are more committed than ever to seizing the vast and evolving opportunities in AI. We will nearly triple the investment capital of our xScale program once our latest joint venture is fully realized. But xScale is more than an investment vehicle for Equinix. Our xScale program is a force multiplier. Only Equinix is positioned to offer integrated infrastructure at scale across the spectrum of workload requirements from hyperscalers to enterprises to SMEs. Only Equinix can offer this globally. Only Equinix can provide this in an interconnection rich architecture. The combination of these elements marks Equinix as unique amongst our industry peers. The future of Equinix and the digital infrastructure industry is incredibly bright. I firmly believe our relentless customer focus, ability to execute effectively and highly differentiated market position will continue to drive significant long-term value for our customers, our partners, our employees and our shareholders. With that, I'll stop here and open it up to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAri Klein: Thanks and good afternoon. Maybe, Adaire, you talked a little bit about the shifting strategic focus to large campuses. Can you talk a little bit about some of the benefits you would expect from that? And does that change the value proposition of any of your existing markets in any way?\nAdaire Fox-Martin: Hi, thank you. Thank you very much for the question. And this is a key part of the strategy that we put together with our team recently. We have already got a long pipeline of builds that are committed and construction projects that are underway, as Keith mentioned, 57 major programs under work at this point in time. And of course, as we look through that, we will work through that and look at the opportunity to accelerate some of these builds and some of their phases into earlier timeframes so that we can deliver this capacity to our customers and to the market. As we look at the intention to build fewer and larger campuses, this is really a multifaceted approach that enables us to look at this through the lens of securing the power that's necessary to execute in these campuses, doing so in the context of a location that is adjacent to the metros that we operate in and allowing us to offer, which I think is unique in the industry, the entire spectrum of our product continuum to customers that range from hyperscalers with their requirements to enterprises with their large footprint requirements all the way through to our retail business and customers who require interconnection rich capabilities in our environment. So this is, I think, something that will augment our approach to our strategy around design and construction and how we deliver capacity to the market to enable us to continue on our growth trajectory.\nKeith Taylor: Ari, if I may just add one other comment to Adaire's comment. You also have to appreciate that there are certain economies of scale. If you talk about Ralph [ph] with his global design and construction team, there's just too many small, small phases that we do along the process. And it's, the stage of where we are in the industry is just, is inherently inefficient and the average size of the deals that we're seeing today are much larger. And so as Adaire says, it just, it makes sense to aggregate into the, into the major metros in which we focus, the, through the extension of those major metros into other markets as well. And do it in scale and size. And so we get an outsized return relative to where we were. And you sort of service, service the customer with a larger set of capacity available for them.\nAri Klein: Thanks. And maybe a somewhat of a follow up on the development side. It looks like you're adding a significant number of cabinets specifically in the D.C. market, including DC 16, Phase 2 and 3, essentially back to back. Is there something specific you're seeing in that market? Does that go to, that shift to two larger campuses? And just even more broadly in the Americas you have a large amount of cabinets expected to come online over the next 12 to 18 months. Is that to meet backlog? Are you preempting inference demand in any way or is there something else?\nAdaire Fox-Martin: Well, I think we're in the very unfortunate position that market wise demand outstrips supply at the moment. And that is particularly true I think in the North American theater of operation. So we are looking forward to having the opportunity to release this capacity into the market where we know that we will not only be able to serve the needs of our customers, but also command a price premium in this robust pricing environment for the cabs that we release.\nAri Klein: Thank you.\nAdaire Fox-Martin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Good evening Keith. I wanted to just come back to revenue growth. I think the underlying adjusted for power pass through growth this year, 7% to 8%. Could we revisit the investor day last year? I think you talked about this being something of a transition year but longer term you saw 8% to 10% growth and there was just talking about the strong demand and pricing. So how do we think about that as we head into 2025 with the bookings backlog and how that relates to CapEx, especially given some of your new plans on expansion. Thanks.\nAdaire Fox-Martin: Thanks for the question, Simon. I might just jump in first and maybe just comment on some of the dynamics that we saw in the market in Q3 and then pass over to Keith to address some of the specificity of the question that you raised there. I think when we look at the first half of this year we certainly saw some headwinds, even though I believe that performance was solid during the first half of the year. And it would be fair to say that whilst in Q3 some of these headwinds still persist. We saw incredible improvement in our bookings trajectory and there are some underpinning reasons why I believe that to be the case. First of all, we are as we know, in a very strong demand environment. But our sales teams executed with precision on our pipeline and we had phenomenal execution that led to this record gross bookings which of course facilitates the growth in our backlog. And we did that in a way that means that our forward looking pipeline is also strong. So there were no major pull forwards into our Q3 outcomes as a result of the wonderful execution of the sales team. We also focused on some sales plays that cornered in particular conversations for us with our customers, enabling us to deliver solutions in very particular contexts that meet requirements for customer\u2019s right across the spectrum of the market. And we also adopted an approach where we began to demand shape so how we could look at capacity that existed in our tier two metros and demand shape the workload in concurrence with the customer so that we were actually utilizing the capacity in these non tier one metros. And it's interesting to see that the megawatts landing in our non tier 1 metros was 80% up Q on Q. So this coupled with this very strong pipe and Keith alluded to it in his opening remarks where we have already undertaken some presale activity that I think derisks both Q4 and future quarters, and enables us to look, to look forward in a positive way. We've delivered in Q3 some critical capacity into the market and pricing continues to be robust. As you heard, our interconnection ads are strong, power density is rising. So whilst we've had some puts and takes for us Q4 will be about focusing on delivering another great quarter so that we have a strong exit into 2025.\nKeith Taylor: Simon, maybe just adding on to Adaire's comments which I think really hit the mark in so many different ways, but as you can appreciate, our business is very geographically dispersed. As Adaire said, there's demand shaping into markets and that affects that has some impact on price and price points. That all said, the number of core markets that we are currently constrained in is something that has caused us to reflect on how we're going to grow and build the platform and so hence why we're going to build bigger in particular the markets that are the most important ones. And so that is something that I think that you'll continue to hear us talk about. There's the crosscurrents that we referred to at the beginning part of the year and still exist today. But we're seeing thankfully we're seeing the growth activity that more than outweighs these cross currents. The cross currents are really about optimization you've heard us speak about previously, particularly around network companies as they optimize whether it's their cross connect or other services, whether it's DDN providers and the like that tend to be very cross connected. So those are some of the things I think that are the forefront of our mind. That all said, we've set ourselves up for what we believe is going to be a really good Q4. That's going to be the strong indication coming off a record Q3, what does Q4 look like? And then what is the ability of the matrix our sorry, our xScale 2.0 initiative look like as we look into 2025 as well. So it's the combination of those things I think that will allow or give us the confidence that we think we're going to have a very strong exit rate to the business. And maybe just a last couple of points. One of the things we said in our prepared remarks was interconnection. Interconnection revenues have increased. Not only do we see a nice year-over-year growth rate at 10% but the average price point is moving up on a per cross connect basis. And so you're seeing increased density, increased pricing and the componentry of that relative to the size of our total revenue base has been increasing. And so it's the combination of those matters as well that we think will influence our growth rate as we look into 2025 and beyond.\nSimon Flannery: Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Your line is open.\nJonathan Atkin: Thanks. So I have a balance sheet question just with the 2.8 billion in cash, three and a half times net leverage and just given the operating trends that you've talked about, what would you potentially have in how you plan to use some of the cash going forward? Whether it might be like land acquisitions or tuck in or other data center acquisitions. And then I have a follow up. Thanks.\nKeith Taylor: Well Jon, you know the business really well. So with the short term investments which are very, as you can appreciate are very liquid, the cash on the balance sheet at September 30 was $3.2 billion cash and short term investments. We're going to use a billion of that to pay down our debt in November. And so on a pro forma basis, clearly that we have a smaller balance than you're probably anticipating. That all said, given the capital plans that we have, the closure of the Philippines acquisition, the dividend, we're probably going to end the year around $1.5 billion of cash. And as you and the other analysts and some investors are aware, we have a really meaningful capital appetite looking forward into 2025, but maybe even more so in 2026 and 2027 as the growth opportunity presents itself. And then you sort of tie that into also our xScale 2.0 initiative with CPPIB and GIC we're going to be a 25% partner to a $15 billion plus venture. And so we're going to have to fund that as well. And we're already seeing the initial sort of cash demands from that initiative both in what we need to do with the power, the power generator, the utility provider, as well as the long need items with the partners and the vendors. And it's really around the MEP, all the mechanical and electric and plumbing equipment and, and the like. And so that's also a, big consumer of cash on our balance sheet as we anticipate what will happen in the future, which is a lot of revenue coming from those investments. But again, we have to get ahead of them today. And so we need the cash on the balance sheet to certainly fund that future growth, pay the dividend, and continue to scale the business.\nAdaire Fox-Martin: Thanks, Keith. We're very focused on getting that capital into capacity as quickly as possible, right?\nKeith Taylor: Yes. And the leverage, the leverage is, the net leverage number, Jon, as you know, is three and a half times leverage, which is great for the industry, but we do carry a little bit more cash, as you know. But that all said, when you look at it, we still have a tremendous amount of strategic flexibility in our balance sheet and so we'll continue to. We're going to go raise more debt capital. We already have our sites on different parts of the world. We're going to raise the next tranches of debt capital. We've been really efficient with our ATM program. We can put more leverage on the books with great comfort without finding ourselves in harm's way with any of the rating agencies. And so we have a lot of strategic flexibility there. So I think suffice it to say we are in a very enviable position vis-a-vis the liquidity and strategic flexibility we have and the partners we're engaging with to continually to scale the business in the xScale franchise.\nJonathan Atkin: Thank you. My follow up just relates to digital and I might have missed you talked about attach rates. I think that might have been for fabric, but can you just update us on metal and Network Edge and what the plans are going forward, how you see those businesses progressing or not. Thanks.\nAdaire Fox-Martin: Sure. Thank you for the question. I think from an overall digital services portfolio, Equinix has certainly demonstrated some success and some very strong success in the products that are natively digitally enabled, such as fabric and such as Network Edge. Fabric achieved a greater than $250 million annual revenue run rate with a 40% attach. This 40% attach number is a focus point for us and moving forward into Q4 and next year, we think there's the opportunity to increase that attach rate. The growth in fabric was underpinned by solid 1 gigabyte port editions and we continue to see the potential in fabric almost diversifying as an exchange where we have almost 4,000 customers who are connecting to 1,300 cloud and network destinations. Underpinning fabric is obviously Fabric Cloud router which is available in 61 of our metros. And of course all of the key cloud providers are part of this fabric infrastructure. Network Edge 450 plus customers at the moment using this service. It is yet not a meaningful revenue contributor for us at this time, but we do believe that it drives ecosystem magnetism for us and is it is an evolving part of our business and one that we are focusing on under our digital services portfolio. Overall for us, as it relates to the products in this portfolio, we're really looking to ensure that we enhance the customer experience that we deliver improved digital interactions for our customers. That includes the portal capabilities through which the customers connect with us. That includes the API footprint that partners can use to deploy their solutions into our environment. And that will include capabilities like observability providing that view to our customers. Our get started position though our first focus for our digital services portfolio will be around our interconnection product portfolio and continuing to evolve and grow that great franchise.\nJonathan Atkin: Anything on metal then to kind of round out the discussion?\nKeith Taylor: Not at this point. Let me just give you a general, maybe another general comment, Jon, that when we look at digital services they represent just under 8% of our revenues. Metal in and of itself represents 1 1/4% of our revenues. It was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter.\nJonathan Atkin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we will hear from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJames Schneider: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. It was encouraging to see your new xScale joint venture with CPP and GIC. Can you maybe talk about the pace of new capacity additions you expect from that joint venture? Could we see anything by the first half of 2027 or is that early and how should we expect the ratability of that capacity to come on through the 2029 timeframe?\nAdaire Fox-Martin: Yes, we're very excited as well about the opportunity that this represents for us and really does allow us to serve the needs of our customer\u2019s right across the spectrum that we engage. So we agree with you in terms of the enthusiasm here. And this is a transaction that will close shortly and as soon as that transaction closes, given that we have already closed Atlanta and that we will move the Atlanta campus into the JV. This is where we will begin our work using the model that we have redefined in our design process for our data centers. So in terms of timeframe, it's hard to give you the specificity of that right now. I believe that we are probably looking at a 12 to 18 month cycle to introduce this capacity into our footprint. But we are working to ensure that we can bring capacity on as quickly as possible. And that's part of the process that will kick in following the formal close of this transaction.\nKeith Taylor: And Jim, I'll just elaborate a little bit further. We've already placed a number of orders for the long lead items as it relates to the Atlanta and the next campus. So two campuses out, we're currently negotiating with the local power provider in Atlanta. There's multiple other sites in the U.S. that we're working alongside different power producers to enter into an agreement. And so the combination of all those would probably allow you to make the assumption that the delivery of value will start much sooner than 2029. But still a little bit premature to give you exact dates. But it suffice it to say we're getting ready to start preparing the land in Atlanta and that will put us in pretty good position to deliver something much sooner than the 2029 timeframe.\nJames Schneider: Great, thank you. And then maybe as a follow up, it was encouraging to see the resumption in growth in your new cabinet net additions in this quarter. You maybe would love to get a sense of your confidence that the momentum in either the growth rate or the number of cabinets can continue to accelerate from here and maybe talk about some of the underlying drivers of that. Thank you.\nAdaire Fox-Martin: Yes, thank you. Yes, we were also very happy about how this measure showed up in Q3. The volume that came through for us was quite impressive. And I think despite the continuation of the power density gap that we've been highlighting over previous quarters. And underpinning the net billable cabinets, we saw strong bookings, we had lower churn, and we had capacity opening up in some of our key metros, which all contributed to that 3100 number. As we look forward, we think based on the backlog of what's been sold but not being installed, that this will remain solid into Q4 and into early 2025. And so, yep, we're very happy with, as I said, how this showed up, even given, the increasing power density which allowed us to have a churn of 4 kilowatt cab, but to sell it at 6.2 kilowatt cab.\nJames Schneider: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Barden with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Barden: Hey guys, thanks so much for taking the question. So I just want to follow up on, on Jim's question. So, Keith, no good deed goes unpunished. So slide 22. Footnote 2. You highlight that you've made some adjustments to the cabinet disclosure by making a cabinet equivalent. And we talked about this, I think, for several quarters. Could you elaborate a little bit on what is the adjustment? How does this affect, is it equal adjustments in each region? You didn't make the adjustment in Asia. Does it affect the MRR per cabinet disclosures? I mean, it would be helpful to have this conversation. I think, and then if I could. Well, I'll just let you go. And then I have a question for Adaire.\nKeith Taylor: Yes. No, it's a fair question. So this -- again, for those that aren't -- maybe haven't looked at the notes similar to how David has looked at them, this really is more about available cabinet capacity given the demand profile and the density of certain -- density of certain deployments relative to where the power exists today. And so we take -- and this is something from the beginning of time as we continue to -- again, for those that have walked through a data center, you walk through a data center, and you'll see that the site has a very dense cage. There could be idle capacity, at least from an infrastructure perspective. And largely that's because a prior customer has taken the infrastructure that would support that environment. And so we adjust the net cabinets. This is really about us creating that visibility to you, knowing that as density goes up, absent the augmentation of power in certain markets that we will take some of the inventory out. And of course, it adjusts the net utilization. But of course, because you increase density, you're increasing your price points and the volume of revenue going through that cabinet. And again, as I've said publicly in many venues, we price to yield. So we price on a kilowatt basis. And so where they use 1 cabinet or 1,000 cabinets, depending on how much infrastructure you use, that's the revenue that we would earn from the business. So again, there's nothing meaningful here other than to say that given the density factor of some of the deals that we're doing and some of the AI workloads that we're winning, it's adjusting basically the available physical cabinet of capacity that's available. And that offsets some of the builds that we basically brought to market this past quarter. So let me stop there, David, and see if I answered your question or whether there's anything else you'd like us to touch on there.\nDavid Barden: So I just want to clarify. So to the comments that Adaire was making about 4 dubs [ph] is traditional and kind of 6.2 is incremental. Are each of these new cabinets being considered a 1.5 cabinet?\nKeith Taylor: Well, it depends on the configuration and what the specifications were for the data center. Again, we measure this down to the asset level, as you would appreciate. And Ralph and his team do a great job of allocating the available energy across the floor plate depending on the consumption parameters of the customer. And so all that to say is some -- I suppose a network data center like Silicon Valley 1 or DC 2, the kilowatt per cabinet is much lower than it is in some of the newer builds. And so that's just us modifying it. But it's really more about what is that new deployment. But let me give an example. If a customer took a cabinet that was now consuming 20 kilowatts per cabinet, obviously, that has a much more material impact on cabinets we take out of available capacity versus something if that was in a network data center versus a cloud data center. So those are the things that we think about, but it's really about optimization of the asset. Ralph and his team manage it specifically. We also put things on hold in anticipation of introducing -- as you know, we do additional power blocks. We are building more phases. There's a lot of things that go into this. And so if there's something that happened in a given environment, that just might be temporary because we bring things in and out of availability depending on where we are with our power utilization statistics.\nDavid Barden: And then just my final question on that, and I'm sorry to kind of thank you for Keith, for sharing all the insights. But so if I'm going to do an MRR per cabinet, then is the denominator the cabinet or is it the cabinet equivalent, which would be a larger denominator? And so what I'm looking at is more of a normalized MRR cabinet as opposed to a MRR Cabinet?\nKeith Taylor: Yes. We've always measured things out of what we call a cab basis, a cabinet equivalent because you might have a scenario where you sell a cage but you have fewer cabinets. There are a lot of other infrastructure that's gone into the cage. So we always measure on a cab basis.\nDavid Barden: Okay. Good. And then, if I could, I apologize. So maybe it's just me, but it was interesting to read through the prepared remarks and listen to the prepared remarks because we talked maybe 50% of the time about the xScale program and all the investments and the balance sheet management, and it's 1% of revenue. Is this an effort to change the narrative about Equinix being a part of this kind of AI training? Because I feel like the old regime works really hard to convince people that this was not where Equinix was. Then it was all about inference was almost the future, but we're talking a lot about it, and I'm not sure why.\nAdaire Fox-Martin: Okay, that's a great question. Thank you for the opportunity to answer it for you. As we've navigated our xScale journey, I think as we've gained momentum it has become clear to us that xScale is an opportunity to be a multiplier for our core retail co location business. And let me explain why I say that and how. I mean that. First of all, I see it very much as a business where we have a huge opportunity to maintain our already high degree of relevance in the supply chain for construction and design. And as Keith has already alluded to, we manage a whole series of very strategic suppliers to enable us to build as quickly as possible and deliver revenue as quickly as possible for all of our new builds. xScale has a benefit in ensuring that as we're building at this kind of scale and this kind of size, supply chain, position and stature remains for Equinix where it is now, which is in the top quadrant. The second element around, the narrative around xScale is that we have recognized that with the xScale footprint we have a complete product set that addresses the evolving needs of our customers. So I feel that our process and our approach is very balance orientated and very about xScale being an and to our existing business instead of a nor. First off, with hyperscalers we are able obviously to capture the training workloads and the large data store requirements of the hyperscaler community. xScale gives us the facility and the ability to do that. For service providers it also gives us the opportunity perhaps to unlock some large footprint. We've seen large footprint demand even for our enterprise customer\u2019s increase over the course of the last period of time. And this enables us to be able to provide that capability to enterprises who are looking to perhaps do private AI with Equinix, who are looking to operate with Equinix at scale across a number of geographic locations. We gave some examples of customers that are enterprise based and who are using Equinix capabilities in order to underpin their AI strategies. So I believe that this full and rich product continuum from hyperscalers, serving enterprises and our retail rich colocation facility is actually the winning strategy because the landscape continues to evolve and we now have an opportunity to be able to respond to how that landscape evolves over time. So please see this as an and not an or. We want to very clearly articulate that for us this is about being balanced in our approach to the opportunity and that whilst training workloads have dominated the total kilowatts leased at this particular point moment in time we see significant opportunity as customers move through the stages of AI adoption at a much more accelerated pace than they move through the stages of cloud adoption. And we are actually talking to our customers not just about AI projects, but about AI enabled strategies. And when you speak about AI enabled strategies, there's a thoughtful process that one needs to consider around how you integrate in a hybrid and multi cloud architecture where you store your data, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. So please, for us this is very much clearly an and motion. And as we've understood more about our momentum and the opportunity in xScale, we see that it allows us to provide a full and rich product continuum serving customers across the spectrum.\nKeith Taylor: All right, thank you. Maybe speaking just a little bit financially on what it means, because it's not lost to me the comment that you made about it being small relative to the size of the business. One of the things we historically said and goes back to 2018, that xScale would be 1% to 2% of revenues and 3% to 5% accretive to our AFFO. As Adaire said, we're going to triple the size of that now. And the fact of the matter is the value accretion from xScale today is probably greater than it was previously, particularly given the new price points, the yields one can derive from that type of investment. So what you're going to see over time is I think, a larger contributor to the cash flow in the business, not only directly but indirectly through the joint venture structure as well. And we're just at the front edge of it today. We get the fee stream, the non-recurring fee stream. You've seen us, we talked about that periodically. But that's not what's going to drive the consistent and recurring value for our franchise. It's the recurring fees and the performance of the JV and our ownership of that JV or JVs that will make a difference to the cash flow and the AFFO that you'll enjoy on a per share basis. And maybe the last comment is, look, on the last earnings call we talked about, the business that we've already sold into, xScale 1.0 is on a run rate basis when installed is $700 million of revenue. It's a substantial adder to growth and it's $6 billion plus of contract value. Now magnify that and think about what is the value that accretes to the businesses that Adaire highlighted. And maybe one last comment which is something that we'll absolutely be thinking about. It's not lost to me that xScale, whether it's Venture 1, Venture 2 or whichever Venture it may be, can be a provider of future inventory to the, to the core business, which is the most important part of what we do as an organization. And so using other people's capital, including part of ours to grow our portfolio is really valuable. And so we see xScale as a really important additive. As Adaire said, it's an and not an or. This is we're going to augment value substantially by the investment decisions we're making and the realization of how important it is to our future.\nDavid Barden: Thank you both. Thank you. Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nTimothy Horan: Hey guys. Keith, just a clarification on that point. Your longer term guide for the xScale of 1% to 2%, 3% to 5% for AFFO. Where are we in that process now or in those numbers now?\nKeith Taylor: Well the revenue is very as you know Tim, and you see it in our disclosures is on a recurring revenue basis is very small because we've sold the, if you will, the space and it's being deployed. I think we're at 385 megawatts. So that's going to get deployed until very, very low recurring, a lot of non-recurring. So that's one. And then when you think about the cost model, all the work that we're doing and the debt that we've consumed and how that appears in the venture, it's not delivering a lot of incremental AFFO yet. Oh sorry AFFO yet. We get AFFO from the non-recurring fees and some of the fit out costs. So it's still on the come which is something that I hope pleases everybody. We see the opportunity in front of us and when this gets to run rate of 700 million plus or wherever we'll ever, wherever we end up with the 2.0 version, it's going to be a much more meaningful line than I think than you would appreciate. And just recognizing today you're not feeling the value yet from it. You get the cash flow from the fee stream, the non-recurring fee stream, but the real value will come in the recurring fee stream and the performance of the joint ventures.\nTimothy Horan: Sure. And does that start to hit like mid next year do you think? Or when does that really start to hit?\nKeith Taylor: Yes, we're already. Well, we're realizing a little bit of it, but certainly you're going to see it, you're going to start to see it accelerate through 25 into 26.\nTimothy Horan: Great. Can you talk about the progression of pricing? Has it gotten better every single quarter as supply has started to kind of dry up? And related to this, how much of future capacity have you presold capacity under development be pre sold?\nAdaire Fox-Martin: Okay. Certainly in terms of what we're seeing from a pricing perspective, the pricing remains robust right across all theaters of operation, but particularly in the Americas market where we are, as I said earlier, not just demand shaping towards our tier one metros, but our non tier one metros who have capacity available, also demand shaping and landing megawatts into those environments and at premium rate prices. So we continue to see robust pricing, we continue to see the opportunity, particularly in high demand environments, in capacity constrained environments, to support a churn that is positive to us where we are able to take workloads that are no longer required in that environment and replace them with much higher value workloads utilizing the same space and the same power. Sorry, the second part of the question, just remind me?\nKeith Taylor: Was just on the volume of prebooking 2 assets that have not yet -- right?\nAdaire Fox-Martin: Yes.\nKeith Taylor: So let me take the second part of the question, Tim. We don't -- we're not ready to give you that number. But suffice it to say, we've got 57 projects currently underway across many markets in many countries. That all said, part of the reason you're hearing us talk about it today, and we haven't talked a lot about it previously, is unless something was available for sale within 6 months, the team was not allowed to book it. Today, given the environment that we all live in and the supply and demand -- or sort of the supply constraints, we're now, if you will, preselling into future development sites that are certainly under construction today. And then on the joint venture basis, those will be things that will be built out tomorrow. And we're not talking about that. We're just talking about things that are -- assets that are under construction today we're preselling. And to give you an order of magnitude, just in order of magnitude, think of it as roughly 20% of the growth activity in the core business. That's what tells you that -- so what I mean that when you think about it, if we did X on core, think about another 20% to 25% you could add to that or business that we're not yet recording as a booking.\nAdaire Fox-Martin: Right. That's in our retail business. And of course, in our xScale business, we've preleased at 92%.\nTimothy Horan: Thanks for all the color guys.\nKeith Taylor: Thanks, Tim.\nChip Newcom: Thank you for joining our Q3 conference call. This concludes the call today.\nAdaire Fox-Martin: Good-bye.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you again for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Keith Taylor",
            "content": "Thanks Adaire and good afternoon to everyone. Let me start by saying we once again delivered another strong quarter. The business continues to execute against its short term goals, another step in our journey while setting the stage for the years ahead. We finished the quarter with record gross bookings with each of our regions at or very near their all-time highs. Our net bookings were also very strong with net megawatts sold in our core business up 60% over the previous quarter, a reflection of the growth and density of our bookings activity. Additionally, we pre- sold a meaningful amount of future capacity which is neither included in our bookings nor our backlog metrics. We closed more than 4,100 deals with more than 3,200 customers and our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO were at the high end of our expectations, the result of solid revenue growth and disciplined cost management. As it relates to our non financial metrics, we saw meaningful improvements across net billable cabinets and interconnections and higher NMR per cabinet. Net billable cabinet stepped up by 3,100 globally driven by strong bookings and capacity openings in certain key markets. Given our record Q3 gross bookings and our elevated backlog of cabinets sold but not yet installed, we expect our net billable cabinet additions to remain strong through the end of the year. Net interconnection additions had a healthy step up as our gross interconnection activity remains at its highest level. Interconnection revenues increased to 19% of recurring revenues. Our MRR per cabinet metric continues to trend favorably, increasing 6% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis to over $2,300 per cabinet, driven by favorable pricing environments and increasing power densities. In the quarter, the average cabinet booked had an average density of 6.2 kilowatts per cabinet, while the density of our turn cabinets was 4 kilowatts per cabinet. As Adaire highlighted, we're excited about the next phase of our xScale initiative. The announcement of our greater than $15 billion joint venture with CPP, IB and GIC is another milestone for Equinix. We continue to believe this off balance sheet joint venture structure will enable us to serve the significant needs of our largest customers for both traditional cloud and emerging AI workloads while delivering significant value to our investors on a per share basis. Bottom line, given the strength of our balance sheet, including our low debt leverage and strategic and operational liquidity alongside the xScale partnerships, we believe that Equinix represents the best opportunity to create value in the digital infrastructure space. Now let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on slide 4, global Q3 revenues were $2.201 billion, up 7% over the same quarter last year at the midpoint of our guidance range due to the deferral of planned xScale fees into 2025. For Q4, our revenue guidance implies a meaningful step up in non-recurring revenues related to xScale fit out activities and other sales activity. Net of our FX hedges, there was a minimal FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 adjusted EBITDA was 1.048 billion or approximately 48% of revenues, up 12% over the same quarter last year at the top end of our guidance range due to strong operating performance. Q3 adjusted EBITDA net of our FX hedges included a $1 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and included $2 million of integration costs. Global Q3 FFO was 866 million, up 12% over the same quarter last year, better than our expectation due to strong operating performance, favorable net interest expense and the timing of our Singapore 6 land lease payment. Q3AFFO included a minimal FX impact when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q3 MRR Churn was lower than planned due to the Deferral of forecasted MRR Churn from late September into early October. As such, when we averaged the expected quarterly churn over the second half of the year, we expect MRR Churn to be in the middle of our 2% to 2.5% quarterly guidance range. Turning to our regional highlights whose full results are covered on slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized basis, APAC was our fastest growing region at 15%, followed by the Americas and EMEA regions growing at 6% and 3% respectively. Excluding the impact of par price actions, APAC grew 17% and EMEA grew 5%. The Americas region delivered very strong bookings across many of our Tier one metros including Dallas, New York, Silicon Valley and Washington DC. Demand continues to outpace supply in top markets driving a favorable pricing environment. Our new business also delivered a great quarter with record gross bookings activity, firm pricing and robust AI deal activity led by our Dubai, Frankfurt, London and Paris metros. We also had healthy activity in our growth in emerging market metros as global scale and reach continue to be a point of differentiation for our business. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a great quarter with near record gross bookings and strong inter-region activity resulting in quarterly revenues reaching the $500 million milestone for the very first time. We experienced continued momentum in our Hong Kong, Osaka, Singapore and Tokyo markets including significant AI demand in Japan for service provider, enterprise and government use cases. And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our balance sheet increased to approximately $35.4 billion including elevated cash and short term investments of $3.2 billion ahead of our $1 billion maturing bond payment in November. In the quarter, we issued more than 750 million in senior green bonds across our Euro and Swiss franc offerings as we continue to align our financings across our investing markets while supporting our Future for Sustainability strategy. To date, Equinix has issued approximately 5.6 billion of green bonds, making our company one of the top 10 largest U.S. investment grade corporate issuers in the green bond market. Additionally, we settled both Forward and spot ATM activity of approximately 975 million in the quarter. We plan to continue to take a balanced and opportunistic approach to accessing the capital markets as and when market conditions are favorable to fund our future growth, including future capital commitment purchases. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter, capital expenditures were $724 million, including recurring CapEx of $69 million, a $24 million increase over the prior quarter. As planned, we have 57 major projects underway in 35 markets across 22 countries, including 13 xScale projects. This represents more than 22,000 cabinets of retail and more than 100 megawatts of xScale capacity to be delivered through 2025. We opened seven major projects in the quarter across seven metros including new data centers in Johannesburg, Istanbul, New York and Tokyo. We also purchased land for development in Amsterdam and Bangkok as we continue to expand our footprint across South East Asia. More than 85% of our current retail expansion spend is on our own land, our own buildings with long-term ground leases. Our capital investments deliver strong returns as shown on Slide 10, our 180 stabilized assets increase revenues by 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis excluding the impact of prior price actions. Stabilized assets were collectively 84% utilized and generated a 26% cash-on-cash return on the gross PPE invested. And finally, please refer to slides 11 through 15 for our updated summary of 2024 guidance and bridges. Do note, all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. For the full year we're raising our revenue guidance by $36 million and our adjusted EBITDA guidance by $10 million due to strong bookings, performance and favorable FX rates. This guidance implies a top line growth rate of 7% to 8%. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be about 47% which includes the acceleration of certain costs into Q3 and Q4. We're also raising our full year AFFO guidance by $18 million and now 11% to 13% increase over the previous year primarily due to operating performance and favorable net interest expense and does include the acceleration of costs into Q3 and Q4. AFFO per share is expected to now grow between 9% and 10% at the top end of our guidance range. And finally, our full year CapEx is expected to range between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion, including about $240 million of recurring CapEx spend. So let me stop here and I'm going to turn the call back to Adaire. Ari, if I may just add one other comment to Adaire's comment. You also have to appreciate that there are certain economies of scale. If you talk about Ralph [ph] with his global design and construction team, there's just too many small, small phases that we do along the process. And it's, the stage of where we are in the industry is just, is inherently inefficient and the average size of the deals that we're seeing today are much larger. And so as Adaire says, it just, it makes sense to aggregate into the, into the major metros in which we focus, the, through the extension of those major metros into other markets as well. And do it in scale and size. And so we get an outsized return relative to where we were. And you sort of service, service the customer with a larger set of capacity available for them. Simon, maybe just adding on to Adaire's comments which I think really hit the mark in so many different ways, but as you can appreciate, our business is very geographically dispersed. As Adaire said, there's demand shaping into markets and that affects that has some impact on price and price points. That all said, the number of core markets that we are currently constrained in is something that has caused us to reflect on how we're going to grow and build the platform and so hence why we're going to build bigger in particular the markets that are the most important ones. And so that is something that I think that you'll continue to hear us talk about. There's the crosscurrents that we referred to at the beginning part of the year and still exist today. But we're seeing thankfully we're seeing the growth activity that more than outweighs these cross currents. The cross currents are really about optimization you've heard us speak about previously, particularly around network companies as they optimize whether it's their cross connect or other services, whether it's DDN providers and the like that tend to be very cross connected. So those are some of the things I think that are the forefront of our mind. That all said, we've set ourselves up for what we believe is going to be a really good Q4. That's going to be the strong indication coming off a record Q3, what does Q4 look like? And then what is the ability of the matrix our sorry, our xScale 2.0 initiative look like as we look into 2025 as well. So it's the combination of those things I think that will allow or give us the confidence that we think we're going to have a very strong exit rate to the business. And maybe just a last couple of points. One of the things we said in our prepared remarks was interconnection. Interconnection revenues have increased. Not only do we see a nice year-over-year growth rate at 10% but the average price point is moving up on a per cross connect basis. And so you're seeing increased density, increased pricing and the componentry of that relative to the size of our total revenue base has been increasing. And so it's the combination of those matters as well that we think will influence our growth rate as we look into 2025 and beyond. Well Jon, you know the business really well. So with the short term investments which are very, as you can appreciate are very liquid, the cash on the balance sheet at September 30 was $3.2 billion cash and short term investments. We're going to use a billion of that to pay down our debt in November. And so on a pro forma basis, clearly that we have a smaller balance than you're probably anticipating. That all said, given the capital plans that we have, the closure of the Philippines acquisition, the dividend, we're probably going to end the year around $1.5 billion of cash. And as you and the other analysts and some investors are aware, we have a really meaningful capital appetite looking forward into 2025, but maybe even more so in 2026 and 2027 as the growth opportunity presents itself. And then you sort of tie that into also our xScale 2.0 initiative with CPPIB and GIC we're going to be a 25% partner to a $15 billion plus venture. And so we're going to have to fund that as well. And we're already seeing the initial sort of cash demands from that initiative both in what we need to do with the power, the power generator, the utility provider, as well as the long need items with the partners and the vendors. And it's really around the MEP, all the mechanical and electric and plumbing equipment and, and the like. And so that's also a, big consumer of cash on our balance sheet as we anticipate what will happen in the future, which is a lot of revenue coming from those investments. But again, we have to get ahead of them today. And so we need the cash on the balance sheet to certainly fund that future growth, pay the dividend, and continue to scale the business. Yes. And the leverage, the leverage is, the net leverage number, Jon, as you know, is three and a half times leverage, which is great for the industry, but we do carry a little bit more cash, as you know. But that all said, when you look at it, we still have a tremendous amount of strategic flexibility in our balance sheet and so we'll continue to. We're going to go raise more debt capital. We already have our sites on different parts of the world. We're going to raise the next tranches of debt capital. We've been really efficient with our ATM program. We can put more leverage on the books with great comfort without finding ourselves in harm's way with any of the rating agencies. And so we have a lot of strategic flexibility there. So I think suffice it to say we are in a very enviable position vis-a-vis the liquidity and strategic flexibility we have and the partners we're engaging with to continually to scale the business in the xScale franchise. Not at this point. Let me just give you a general, maybe another general comment, Jon, that when we look at digital services they represent just under 8% of our revenues. Metal in and of itself represents 1 1/4% of our revenues. It was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. And Jim, I'll just elaborate a little bit further. We've already placed a number of orders for the long lead items as it relates to the Atlanta and the next campus. So two campuses out, we're currently negotiating with the local power provider in Atlanta. There's multiple other sites in the U.S. that we're working alongside different power producers to enter into an agreement. And so the combination of all those would probably allow you to make the assumption that the delivery of value will start much sooner than 2029. But still a little bit premature to give you exact dates. But it suffice it to say we're getting ready to start preparing the land in Atlanta and that will put us in pretty good position to deliver something much sooner than the 2029 timeframe. Yes. No, it's a fair question. So this -- again, for those that aren't -- maybe haven't looked at the notes similar to how David has looked at them, this really is more about available cabinet capacity given the demand profile and the density of certain -- density of certain deployments relative to where the power exists today. And so we take -- and this is something from the beginning of time as we continue to -- again, for those that have walked through a data center, you walk through a data center, and you'll see that the site has a very dense cage. There could be idle capacity, at least from an infrastructure perspective. And largely that's because a prior customer has taken the infrastructure that would support that environment. And so we adjust the net cabinets. This is really about us creating that visibility to you, knowing that as density goes up, absent the augmentation of power in certain markets that we will take some of the inventory out. And of course, it adjusts the net utilization. But of course, because you increase density, you're increasing your price points and the volume of revenue going through that cabinet. And again, as I've said publicly in many venues, we price to yield. So we price on a kilowatt basis. And so where they use 1 cabinet or 1,000 cabinets, depending on how much infrastructure you use, that's the revenue that we would earn from the business. So again, there's nothing meaningful here other than to say that given the density factor of some of the deals that we're doing and some of the AI workloads that we're winning, it's adjusting basically the available physical cabinet of capacity that's available. And that offsets some of the builds that we basically brought to market this past quarter. So let me stop there, David, and see if I answered your question or whether there's anything else you'd like us to touch on there. Well, it depends on the configuration and what the specifications were for the data center. Again, we measure this down to the asset level, as you would appreciate. And Ralph and his team do a great job of allocating the available energy across the floor plate depending on the consumption parameters of the customer. And so all that to say is some -- I suppose a network data center like Silicon Valley 1 or DC 2, the kilowatt per cabinet is much lower than it is in some of the newer builds. And so that's just us modifying it. But it's really more about what is that new deployment. But let me give an example. If a customer took a cabinet that was now consuming 20 kilowatts per cabinet, obviously, that has a much more material impact on cabinets we take out of available capacity versus something if that was in a network data center versus a cloud data center. So those are the things that we think about, but it's really about optimization of the asset. Ralph and his team manage it specifically. We also put things on hold in anticipation of introducing -- as you know, we do additional power blocks. We are building more phases. There's a lot of things that go into this. And so if there's something that happened in a given environment, that just might be temporary because we bring things in and out of availability depending on where we are with our power utilization statistics. Yes. We've always measured things out of what we call a cab basis, a cabinet equivalent because you might have a scenario where you sell a cage but you have fewer cabinets. There are a lot of other infrastructure that's gone into the cage. So we always measure on a cab basis. All right, thank you. Maybe speaking just a little bit financially on what it means, because it's not lost to me the comment that you made about it being small relative to the size of the business. One of the things we historically said and goes back to 2018, that xScale would be 1% to 2% of revenues and 3% to 5% accretive to our AFFO. As Adaire said, we're going to triple the size of that now. And the fact of the matter is the value accretion from xScale today is probably greater than it was previously, particularly given the new price points, the yields one can derive from that type of investment. So what you're going to see over time is I think, a larger contributor to the cash flow in the business, not only directly but indirectly through the joint venture structure as well. And we're just at the front edge of it today. We get the fee stream, the non-recurring fee stream. You've seen us, we talked about that periodically. But that's not what's going to drive the consistent and recurring value for our franchise. It's the recurring fees and the performance of the JV and our ownership of that JV or JVs that will make a difference to the cash flow and the AFFO that you'll enjoy on a per share basis. And maybe the last comment is, look, on the last earnings call we talked about, the business that we've already sold into, xScale 1.0 is on a run rate basis when installed is $700 million of revenue. It's a substantial adder to growth and it's $6 billion plus of contract value. Now magnify that and think about what is the value that accretes to the businesses that Adaire highlighted. And maybe one last comment which is something that we'll absolutely be thinking about. It's not lost to me that xScale, whether it's Venture 1, Venture 2 or whichever Venture it may be, can be a provider of future inventory to the, to the core business, which is the most important part of what we do as an organization. And so using other people's capital, including part of ours to grow our portfolio is really valuable. And so we see xScale as a really important additive. As Adaire said, it's an and not an or. This is we're going to augment value substantially by the investment decisions we're making and the realization of how important it is to our future. Well the revenue is very as you know Tim, and you see it in our disclosures is on a recurring revenue basis is very small because we've sold the, if you will, the space and it's being deployed. I think we're at 385 megawatts. So that's going to get deployed until very, very low recurring, a lot of non-recurring. So that's one. And then when you think about the cost model, all the work that we're doing and the debt that we've consumed and how that appears in the venture, it's not delivering a lot of incremental AFFO yet. Oh sorry AFFO yet. We get AFFO from the non-recurring fees and some of the fit out costs. So it's still on the come which is something that I hope pleases everybody. We see the opportunity in front of us and when this gets to run rate of 700 million plus or wherever we'll ever, wherever we end up with the 2.0 version, it's going to be a much more meaningful line than I think than you would appreciate. And just recognizing today you're not feeling the value yet from it. You get the cash flow from the fee stream, the non-recurring fee stream, but the real value will come in the recurring fee stream and the performance of the joint ventures. Yes, we're already. Well, we're realizing a little bit of it, but certainly you're going to see it, you're going to start to see it accelerate through 25 into 26. Was just on the volume of prebooking 2 assets that have not yet -- right? So let me take the second part of the question, Tim. We don't -- we're not ready to give you that number. But suffice it to say, we've got 57 projects currently underway across many markets in many countries. That all said, part of the reason you're hearing us talk about it today, and we haven't talked a lot about it previously, is unless something was available for sale within 6 months, the team was not allowed to book it. Today, given the environment that we all live in and the supply and demand -- or sort of the supply constraints, we're now, if you will, preselling into future development sites that are certainly under construction today. And then on the joint venture basis, those will be things that will be built out tomorrow. And we're not talking about that. We're just talking about things that are -- assets that are under construction today we're preselling. And to give you an order of magnitude, just in order of magnitude, think of it as roughly 20% of the growth activity in the core business. That's what tells you that -- so what I mean that when you think about it, if we did X on core, think about another 20% to 25% you could add to that or business that we're not yet recording as a booking. Thanks, Tim."

            "name": "Adaire Fox-Martin",
            "content": "Thank you. Chip Good afternoon and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We had an outstanding quarter. We delivered record growth bookings with strong performance across each of our three regions. We had solid deal conversion rates and pricing remained robust. Cabinets billing increased meaningfully. All of this translated into our 87th quarter of consecutive revenue growth with attractive AFFO per share profitability, highlighting the scale and differentiation that reinforces our market position. Importantly, given the robust demand for digital infrastructure to enable AI capabilities across industries and regions, our forward-looking pipeline remains strong with healthy pre sales activities supporting our momentum in Q4 and beyond. Turning to our strategy, as I discussed last quarter, Equinix has developed a differentiated and successful business over the last two and a half decades, creating exceptional value for our customers and our shareholders. Our strength is underpinned by our position as the world's leading digital infrastructure company, our truly global footprint and scale, our neutrality and our singular value proposition around interconnection. However, we recognize that our industry landscape is dynamic and increasingly complex. Customer requirements and data center designs are evolving rapidly. Energy constraints and long-term development cycles pose challenges to our industry's ability to serve customers effectively. Equinix is particularly well positioned to address these challenges as an industry leader to seize the significant opportunities ahead and drive future growth. To this end, we will focus on three strategic areas built on the tenets I shared on last quarter's earnings call of clarity, simplicity and focus. First, we will start outside in with our customers. We will focus on enhancing how we engage with our customers at every milestone in our relationship with them. Our goal is to be the partner of choice for our customer's most critical infrastructure workloads. To achieve this, we intend to evolve our go-to-market engine in a structured and coordinated manner to deliver a frictionless customer experience that is segment appropriate. We have already seen the benefit of solution and segment focus in our record Q3 gross bookings outcome. Second, we will deliver integrated solutions that make it easier for our customers and partners to deploy and consume solutions at Equinix. Our initial efforts will focus on developing smarter solutions that extend our core co-location and interconnection offerings. This is where we have the right to win and the right to lead. In support of this, we have brought together our data center services team and our digital services team into a single business area led by Jon Lin. Third, we have been innovating in data center design and our approach to data center construction. We are fortunate to have industry leading procurement, design and construction teams. We intend to build for the future and accelerate our development of differentiated campuses that support the broad range of our customer's needs. Essentially, this means moving from many smaller builds with phased capacity delivery to fewer larger bills, balancing location with access to power on campuses that can service the full range of our customer's needs from SMEs to hyperscalers. At the same time, we will remain focused on delivering industry leading investment returns by continuing to meet the evolving needs of our customers, placing the right application into the right footprint for the best business outcome. Taken together, I believe these strategic moves which are about doing less so that we can deliver more, will drive significant long-term value for our customers, partners and shareholders. We continue to invest in the market opportunities we believe lie ahead. Earlier this month we announced our plans to nearly triple the investment capital of our xScale program with the agreement to form a greater than 15 billion joint venture with the CPP Investment Board and GIC. With the capital raised through this new JV, Equinix expects to build new state of the art xScale facilities on multiple campuses across the U.S. each with the capacity of multiple hundreds of megawatts. As discussed previously, we've already closed on land and power for a 240 megawatt xScale campus in Atlanta which we expect to contribute to this new JV. We are currently in active diligence to secure power and land in additional U.S. markets and look forward to providing more details in the coming quarters. Since our last earnings call in our established JVs, we have leased an incremental 20 megawatts in our SOL 2 [ph] data center. This brings total xScale leasing to 385megawatts globally with nearly 90% of our operational and under construction capacity leased. We believe Equinix is uniquely positioned to innovate with and for hyperscalers and we are excited about the opportunities ahead. Enterprise demand is steadily building for AI related workloads. We remain the preferred location for server provider onramps supporting the data ingestion and distribution requirements of AI workloads. Equinix customers can enjoy low latency access to native hyperscaler on ramps in 47 metros across 25 countries. This includes 12 metros with onramps to five or more providers. This is six times the coverage of our nearest competitor. Recent key service provider wins and production use cases include Nebius, a full stack AI infrastructure provider. Their new deployment in Paris will be among the first in Europe to offer NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs in support of providing essential resources for customer AI journeys. Sakura Internet, a Japanese cloud service provider is actively involved in the development of large scale cloud services for generative AI and aims to enhance its GPU based cloud services to explore new business opportunities in Asia. For Enterprise AI, Equinix is supporting our Fortune 200 shipping and logistics company who deployed at Equinix to unlock predictive capabilities in logistics and build intelligent data driven supply chains. We are also supporting a leading med tech company who is leveraging AI algorithms to analyze endoscopic images in real time. This will save lives through enhancing diagnostic precision. Our unique business model enables us to serve the full spectrum of our customers AI requirements. Our retail footprint is well positioned to serve the inferencing and private AI workloads of enterprises of varying sizes. Our rapidly expanding xScale offering can meet the significant requirements of hyperscalers and service providers. Our ability to satisfy these needs fortifies our resilience in capturing upside and managing potential downside in a highly dynamic and evolving AI landscape. Turning to our results, as depicted on slide 3 Q3 revenues were 2.2 billion, up 7% over the same quarter last year driven by strong recurring revenue growth and xScale fees. Adjusted EBITDA was up 12% year-over-year with solid AFFO per share profitability. Interconnection revenues increased 10% year-over-year with continued strength from Equinix Fabric. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Fueling our industry leading global interconnection franchise we now have 478,000 total interconnections deployed across our footprint. Growth Interconnection additions remain strong and pricing continues to trend favorably. Net interconnection additions improved to 5,700 due to strong increase in hyperscale across connects and the continued diversification of our ecosystems. Equinix Fabric saw continued solid growth and is now operating at an annual revenue run rate of greater than US$250 million with an attach rate of approximately 40% across our global customer base. Our fabric business grew thanks to 100 gigabit port editions and higher bandwidth virtual connections. Equinix Internet Exchange saw peak traffic surpass 40 terabits per second for the first time. In August we opened our first data center in Johannesburg to support the growing digital infrastructure and connectivity needs of enterprises and service providers in the rapidly growing African continent. We also opened the first phases of our New York 3 and Tokyo 15 IBXs this quarter, easing capacity constraints in two of our key metros. Customers taking advantage of our expanding global footprint include PubMatic, a digital advertising firm who expanded their partnership with Equinix to leverage AI powered predictive analytics for their ad campaigns. SaaS provider Zoho chose Equinix so they could better support their customers in complying with European data sovereignty requirements. Our channel program delivered another solid quarter contributing approximately 50% of new logos. We continued to see growth from partners like Avant, Dell, Orange Business and WWT with wins across a wide range of industry segments and use cases including AI. Q3 wins include a data center modernization project with AT&T. Together we helped a customer experience technology company blend cloud and private infrastructure resources, enable multi cloud networking and accelerate AI and automation enhancements for customer interactions. We believe this quarter is a testament to the trust our customers place in us and the value they realize from partnering strategically with us. With that, I'll turn it over to Keith to cover the quarter's financials. Thank you Keith. In closing, we had a great third quarter, achieving record growth bookings and delivering robust performance across key financial and non financial metrics. We are more committed than ever to seizing the vast and evolving opportunities in AI. We will nearly triple the investment capital of our xScale program once our latest joint venture is fully realized. But xScale is more than an investment vehicle for Equinix. Our xScale program is a force multiplier. Only Equinix is positioned to offer integrated infrastructure at scale across the spectrum of workload requirements from hyperscalers to enterprises to SMEs. Only Equinix can offer this globally. Only Equinix can provide this in an interconnection rich architecture. The combination of these elements marks Equinix as unique amongst our industry peers. The future of Equinix and the digital infrastructure industry is incredibly bright. I firmly believe our relentless customer focus, ability to execute effectively and highly differentiated market position will continue to drive significant long-term value for our customers, our partners, our employees and our shareholders. With that, I'll stop here and open it up to questions. Hi, thank you. Thank you very much for the question. And this is a key part of the strategy that we put together with our team recently. We have already got a long pipeline of builds that are committed and construction projects that are underway, as Keith mentioned, 57 major programs under work at this point in time. And of course, as we look through that, we will work through that and look at the opportunity to accelerate some of these builds and some of their phases into earlier timeframes so that we can deliver this capacity to our customers and to the market. As we look at the intention to build fewer and larger campuses, this is really a multifaceted approach that enables us to look at this through the lens of securing the power that's necessary to execute in these campuses, doing so in the context of a location that is adjacent to the metros that we operate in and allowing us to offer, which I think is unique in the industry, the entire spectrum of our product continuum to customers that range from hyperscalers with their requirements to enterprises with their large footprint requirements all the way through to our retail business and customers who require interconnection rich capabilities in our environment. So this is, I think, something that will augment our approach to our strategy around design and construction and how we deliver capacity to the market to enable us to continue on our growth trajectory. Well, I think we're in the very unfortunate position that market wise demand outstrips supply at the moment. And that is particularly true I think in the North American theater of operation. So we are looking forward to having the opportunity to release this capacity into the market where we know that we will not only be able to serve the needs of our customers, but also command a price premium in this robust pricing environment for the cabs that we release. Thank you. Thanks for the question, Simon. I might just jump in first and maybe just comment on some of the dynamics that we saw in the market in Q3 and then pass over to Keith to address some of the specificity of the question that you raised there. I think when we look at the first half of this year we certainly saw some headwinds, even though I believe that performance was solid during the first half of the year. And it would be fair to say that whilst in Q3 some of these headwinds still persist. We saw incredible improvement in our bookings trajectory and there are some underpinning reasons why I believe that to be the case. First of all, we are as we know, in a very strong demand environment. But our sales teams executed with precision on our pipeline and we had phenomenal execution that led to this record gross bookings which of course facilitates the growth in our backlog. And we did that in a way that means that our forward looking pipeline is also strong. So there were no major pull forwards into our Q3 outcomes as a result of the wonderful execution of the sales team. We also focused on some sales plays that cornered in particular conversations for us with our customers, enabling us to deliver solutions in very particular contexts that meet requirements for customer's right across the spectrum of the market. And we also adopted an approach where we began to demand shape so how we could look at capacity that existed in our tier two metros and demand shape the workload in concurrence with the customer so that we were actually utilizing the capacity in these non tier one metros. And it's interesting to see that the megawatts landing in our non tier 1 metros was 80% up Q on Q. So this coupled with this very strong pipe and Keith alluded to it in his opening remarks where we have already undertaken some presale activity that I think derisks both Q4 and future quarters, and enables us to look, to look forward in a positive way. We've delivered in Q3 some critical capacity into the market and pricing continues to be robust. As you heard, our interconnection ads are strong, power density is rising. So whilst we've had some puts and takes for us Q4 will be about focusing on delivering another great quarter so that we have a strong exit into 2025. Thanks, Keith. We're very focused on getting that capital into capacity as quickly as possible, right? Sure. Thank you for the question. I think from an overall digital services portfolio, Equinix has certainly demonstrated some success and some very strong success in the products that are natively digitally enabled, such as fabric and such as Network Edge. Fabric achieved a greater than $250 million annual revenue run rate with a 40% attach. This 40% attach number is a focus point for us and moving forward into Q4 and next year, we think there's the opportunity to increase that attach rate. The growth in fabric was underpinned by solid 1 gigabyte port editions and we continue to see the potential in fabric almost diversifying as an exchange where we have almost 4,000 customers who are connecting to 1,300 cloud and network destinations. Underpinning fabric is obviously Fabric Cloud router which is available in 61 of our metros. And of course all of the key cloud providers are part of this fabric infrastructure. Network Edge 450 plus customers at the moment using this service. It is yet not a meaningful revenue contributor for us at this time, but we do believe that it drives ecosystem magnetism for us and is it is an evolving part of our business and one that we are focusing on under our digital services portfolio. Overall for us, as it relates to the products in this portfolio, we're really looking to ensure that we enhance the customer experience that we deliver improved digital interactions for our customers. That includes the portal capabilities through which the customers connect with us. That includes the API footprint that partners can use to deploy their solutions into our environment. And that will include capabilities like observability providing that view to our customers. Our get started position though our first focus for our digital services portfolio will be around our interconnection product portfolio and continuing to evolve and grow that great franchise. Yes, we're very excited as well about the opportunity that this represents for us and really does allow us to serve the needs of our customer's right across the spectrum that we engage. So we agree with you in terms of the enthusiasm here. And this is a transaction that will close shortly and as soon as that transaction closes, given that we have already closed Atlanta and that we will move the Atlanta campus into the JV. This is where we will begin our work using the model that we have redefined in our design process for our data centers. So in terms of timeframe, it's hard to give you the specificity of that right now. I believe that we are probably looking at a 12 to 18 month cycle to introduce this capacity into our footprint. But we are working to ensure that we can bring capacity on as quickly as possible. And that's part of the process that will kick in following the formal close of this transaction. Yes, thank you. Yes, we were also very happy about how this measure showed up in Q3. The volume that came through for us was quite impressive. And I think despite the continuation of the power density gap that we've been highlighting over previous quarters. And underpinning the net billable cabinets, we saw strong bookings, we had lower churn, and we had capacity opening up in some of our key metros, which all contributed to that 3100 number. As we look forward, we think based on the backlog of what's been sold but not being installed, that this will remain solid into Q4 and into early 2025. And so, yep, we're very happy with, as I said, how this showed up, even given, the increasing power density which allowed us to have a churn of 4 kilowatt cab, but to sell it at 6.2 kilowatt cab. Okay, that's a great question. Thank you for the opportunity to answer it for you. As we've navigated our xScale journey, I think as we've gained momentum it has become clear to us that xScale is an opportunity to be a multiplier for our core retail co location business. And let me explain why I say that and how. I mean that. First of all, I see it very much as a business where we have a huge opportunity to maintain our already high degree of relevance in the supply chain for construction and design. And as Keith has already alluded to, we manage a whole series of very strategic suppliers to enable us to build as quickly as possible and deliver revenue as quickly as possible for all of our new builds. xScale has a benefit in ensuring that as we're building at this kind of scale and this kind of size, supply chain, position and stature remains for Equinix where it is now, which is in the top quadrant. The second element around, the narrative around xScale is that we have recognized that with the xScale footprint we have a complete product set that addresses the evolving needs of our customers. So I feel that our process and our approach is very balance orientated and very about xScale being an and to our existing business instead of a nor. First off, with hyperscalers we are able obviously to capture the training workloads and the large data store requirements of the hyperscaler community. xScale gives us the facility and the ability to do that. For service providers it also gives us the opportunity perhaps to unlock some large footprint. We've seen large footprint demand even for our enterprise customer's increase over the course of the last period of time. And this enables us to be able to provide that capability to enterprises who are looking to perhaps do private AI with Equinix, who are looking to operate with Equinix at scale across a number of geographic locations. We gave some examples of customers that are enterprise based and who are using Equinix capabilities in order to underpin their AI strategies. So I believe that this full and rich product continuum from hyperscalers, serving enterprises and our retail rich colocation facility is actually the winning strategy because the landscape continues to evolve and we now have an opportunity to be able to respond to how that landscape evolves over time. So please see this as an and not an or. We want to very clearly articulate that for us this is about being balanced in our approach to the opportunity and that whilst training workloads have dominated the total kilowatts leased at this particular point moment in time we see significant opportunity as customers move through the stages of AI adoption at a much more accelerated pace than they move through the stages of cloud adoption. And we are actually talking to our customers not just about AI projects, but about AI enabled strategies. And when you speak about AI enabled strategies, there's a thoughtful process that one needs to consider around how you integrate in a hybrid and multi cloud architecture where you store your data, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. So please, for us this is very much clearly an and motion. And as we've understood more about our momentum and the opportunity in xScale, we see that it allows us to provide a full and rich product continuum serving customers across the spectrum. Okay. Certainly in terms of what we're seeing from a pricing perspective, the pricing remains robust right across all theaters of operation, but particularly in the Americas market where we are, as I said earlier, not just demand shaping towards our tier one metros, but our non tier one metros who have capacity available, also demand shaping and landing megawatts into those environments and at premium rate prices. So we continue to see robust pricing, we continue to see the opportunity, particularly in high demand environments, in capacity constrained environments, to support a churn that is positive to us where we are able to take workloads that are no longer required in that environment and replace them with much higher value workloads utilizing the same space and the same power. Sorry, the second part of the question, just remind me? Yes. Right. That's in our retail business. And of course, in our xScale business, we've preleased at 92%. Good-bye."

Our focus on customer value and outcomes has created interconnected digital ecosystems unrivaled in our industry. It is a phenomenal foundation to build upon as CEO. As the stewards of some of the most important digital infrastructure in the world, we are exceptionally and uniquely positioned to capitalize on the immense opportunities that lie ahead. Business transformation remains a critical priority for our customers, and the emergence of AI marks a pivotal point for our industry. AI, similar to the growth of cloud technologies a decade ago, will take time to fully develop. In the near term AI training workloads are driving significant demand, particularly from service providers. Our xScale program continues to be a direct beneficiary of this demand. We intend to build on this momentum meaningfully augmenting and extending our xScale portfolio, particularly in North America. This will complement our robust portfolio across Europe and Asia Pacific. We are excited to share that we recently closed on land and power for our first multi hundred megawatt xScale campus in Atlanta. We look forward to announcing details of this project and our next xScale joint venture in the coming months. At the operational end of the AI spectrum, our network nodes and inference workloads as with cloud, Equinix continues to be the preferred location for network nodes as customers seek the right connectivity solutions for data ingestion and distribution. We also see inference demand beginning to take shape. We believe the implementation and deployment of these workloads will accelerate over the coming years. The neutrality, global reach and scale of platform Equinix can deliver the performance, network density and cloud adjacency which inference workloads will require. We are already seeing significant enterprise and service provider interest in our deployment capabilities. In Q2, we partnered with WWT to serve Almavic [ph] Technologies, an AI powered marketing analytics platform for enterprise. Almavic [ph] Technologies deployed their AI infrastructure at Equinix to run proprietary inference algorithms on massive datasets for predictable cost, privacy, speed and secure access to data sources in the cloud. InstaDeep, a leading provider of AI decision making solutions, deployed an Nvidia AI cluster at our Paris 10 asset to access key ecosystems, optimize their network, and support their growth objectives. Our approach to the market opportunity created by AI is multifaceted and we believe it will deliver value in the short term and sustainable growth over the medium to long term. Our xScale offering provides the infrastructure and expertise required for massive scalable data center operations for our cloud and large scale technology customers. For our enterprise and mid-market customers, we offer AI ready data centers and turnkey solutions, enabling them to scale efficiently and effectively as they introduce AI technologies into their business operations. For those who require high performance inferencing, our Edge solutions handle the data at the edge where it is generated, ensuring optimal performance for the next generation of business applications. Over the past two months I have embarked on a listening tour across a number of our locations, meeting with our customers, partners and employees and whilst it is still early in my tenure and there is still work that I need to complete, I have noted some areas of opportunity that will underpin our strategy for the company going forward. The opportunity to simplify across numerous aspects of our business. This will allow us to accelerate our pace of execution. The opportunity to drive more focus whilst we may do less. The programs of work that we focus on will represent excellence in execution and deliver the highest quality outcomes. The opportunity to amplify our go-to-market efforts to delight our customers and energize our partners. Equinix has consistently demonstrated discipline and execution. This mantra of discipline allows us to deliver market leading returns on capital and serves as the underlying fuel for long-term growth in AFFO per share, our core financial metric. Building on this foundation and executing on the opportunities I noted should create a simpler, more focused and ultimately higher valued company. With all of this in mind, I'll turn to our Q2 performance. Equinix had a great second quarter. We delivered record growth bookings. Our pricing remains strong. We continue to invest broadly across our offerings to further enhance the scale and reach of our industry leading platform. Our delivery of Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share continues to run ahead of expectations. As you can see on Slide three Q2 revenues were $2.2 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year. This represents our 86th consecutive quarter of top line growth. Adjusted EBITDA was up 17% year-over-year with strong AFFO per share flow-through. Interconnection revenue stepped up to 9% year-over-year. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. In May, we announced the opening of our first data center in Johor with strong interest from customers across our new Malaysian footprint. In July, we announced our expansion into the Philippines through the planned acquisition of three data centers in Manila from Total Information Management. This transaction, valued at approximately $180 million, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, adding more than 1,000 cabinets of capacity, in addition to land for future development. The combination of our strong leadership position in our Singapore hub and our entries into Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines strategically position Equinix to help our customers capitalize on the expanding digital opportunity in the fast-growing Southeast Asia region. Customers taking advantage of our expanding global footprint include FirstDigital, an Internet and telecommunications provider. FirstDigital is significantly lowering total cost of ownership by building a multi-cloud network with Equinix Fabric Cloud Router to connect to Cisco WebEx and AWS across all three regions. Our global interconnection franchise continues to perform with over 472,000 total interconnections now deployed. Gross interconnection additions were at the highest level in 2 years and pricing continues to trend favorably. However, net interconnection adds were 3,900 due to grooming activity, primarily in our content and networking verticals. We do expect this grooming to lessen over time. Equinix Fabric growth was underpinned by 100 gigabit port additions and strong pull-through from other digital services products. Network Edge experienced continued rapid growth with an expansion activity from existing customers. The recent interconnection and ecosystem wins, include Nuam Exchange. This is a new company formed after the integration of the Santiago Lima and Colombia Stock Exchanges. Capital market participants can now benefit from Nuam's extended reach, low latency and secure connectivity supported by Equinix in key markets like New York and Sao Paulo. Our channel program delivered another solid quarter, accounting for over 30% of new bookings and 55% of company new logos. We continue to see growth from partners like AT&T, Avant, Dell, HPE and Orange business, with wins across a wide range of industry segments and use cases. Notable wins included an AI as a service solution via our distribution partner, Tech Data and MSP partner AsiaPac. Leveraging a combination of co-location and Equinix Fabric, our partners are delivering an LLM for a high-level learning institution based in Malaysia. Now before I turn the call over to Keith, I wanted to recognize that we believe we are in a position of strength financially from both a balance sheet and from an access to capital perspective. Our investment strategy delivers a strong return on invested capital, all of which gives us the flexibility to execute our go-forward strategy. With that, I'll turn it over to Keith to cover the results from the quarter.\nKeith Taylor: Great. Thanks, Adaire. Now let me first say, I look forward to the next phase of the Equinix journey alongside you and I know it's going to be a very exciting time for all of us at Equinix. And also good afternoon to all of those that are on the call today or who might be listening later. So to start, we had a great second quarter as the team continued to execute against our plans. We had record gross bookings, closing more than 4,000 deals with more than 3,000 customers. We continued our trend of net positive pricing actions, and we ended the quarter with solid net bookings. Our forward-looking pipeline remains deep, which we expect will drive momentum in the second half of the year, and we're delivering profitability ahead of our expectations. As a result, we're again raising our full year adjusted EBITDA and AFFO guidance, and therefore, AFFO per share too, our lighthouse metric. Also, as Adaire highlighted, I'm excited about the next phase of our xScale initiatives. We plan to lean into this program as we've seen strong demand from this offering -- for this offering, as evidenced by both our cloud and AI bookings momentum. We continue to believe this off-balance sheet JV structure with our equity partners is the right model to pursue this significant opportunity, which also drives durable value on a per share basis. To date, through the xScale JVs, we've invested about $4.7 billion in the program. Since our last earnings call, we leased an incremental 17 megawatts of capacity in our Silicon Valley 12 and Paris 13 assets. This brings our total global xScale leasing to 365 megawatts, representing nearly $6 billion of total contract value and more than $700 million of annualized revenue once these assets are fully ramped. Looking forward, we have a strong funnel of additional xScale opportunities and we look forward to updating you on our future JV partnerships in the near term. For non-financial metrics, MR per cabinet is rising, increasing 7% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis to $2,287 per cabinet, driven by favorable pricing environment, solid interconnection attach rates and increasing prior densities. As discussed on our last earnings call, as expected, we saw continued pressure on our unadjusted net cabinets billing metric due to capacity constraints in certain key markets, increasing power density and timing of churn. StackPath unexpectedly announced their immediate liquidation in June, resulting in 300 cabinets churning at quarter end as an example. Related to cabinet density, the Q2 cabinet churn were on an average density of 4 kilowatts per cabinet while the new cabinets booked were at an average density of 5.9 kilowatts per cabinet. In Q2, non-xScale net megawatts sold increased meaningfully compared to the prior six quarters. As we look forward, given our strong gross bookings and as a result, the rising backlog of cabinets sold but not yet installed, we expect billable cabinets to improve in the second half of the year. On the sustainability front, we're continuing to advance our bold Future First agenda, implementing innovative ways to integrate into the communities in which we operate. This includes new heat export programs across Europe and the Americas, including our new Paris 10 IBX, which helps heat a portion of the aquatic center at the Paris Olympics. This is one example of a sustainability initiative that we believe will become commonplace in the markets we serve in the future. Now let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, Global Q2 revenues were $2.59 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year and in the upper half of our guidance range on a constant currency basis, including the impact of a one-off charge against recurring revenues. As expected, non-recurring revenue stepped up sequentially due to strong xScale leasing activity in the quarter. Q2 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $6 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates due to the weaker Brazilian real and the Japanese yen in the quarter. Global Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $1.036 billion or 48% of revenues, up 17% over the same quarter last year and above the $1 billion quarterly threshold for the very first time. Relative to our expectations, adjusted EBITDA was at the top end of our guidance range due to strong operating profits and timing of spend. Q2-adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, included a $3 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and $4 million of integration costs. Global Q2 AFFO was $877 million, up 17% over the same quarter last year, better than our expectations due to strong operating performance and the timing of the land lease payment related to our upcoming Singapore 6 build. Q2 AFFO included a $3 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q2 MRR churn was 2.3%. For the balance of the year, we expect MRR churn to remain in the 2% to 2.5% quarterly guidance range. Turning to our regional highlights, the results, which are covered on Slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized basis, APAC was our fastest-growing region at 11%, followed by the Americas and EMEA regions growing at 9% and 5%, respectively. The Americas region had a great quarter with record gross bookings led by strong financial services activity, firm pricing and a higher mix of medium and large footprint deals. We saw particular strength in our Tier 1 markets, including Dallas, New York, Washington, D.C. Our EMEA business delivered a solid quarter with healthy bookings activity and strong pricing. The team did an excellent job selling our global platform with record exports and strong intra-region activity, including into growth in emerging markets such as Abu Dhabi, Istanbul and Warsaw. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a strong quarter with momentum in our largest markets in the region, including Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo as well as strong customer interest in our new Asian metros. Encouragingly, we saw strong intra-region activity driven by customers deploying AI workloads in both Japan and Malaysia. And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our balance sheet increased to approximately $33 billion, including an unrestricted cash balance of $2 billion. Our cash balance increased quarter-over-quarter due to strong operating cash flow and the debt raised in the quarter, offset by our growth investments and the cash dividend. In May, we raised $750 million of senior U.S. dollar notes due in 2034, and we immediately swapped these notes into euros at an effective interest rate of 3.9%. Our net leverage remains low relative to our peers of 3.5x our annualized adjusted EBITDA. Our blended debt borrowing rate is now 2.4%, the lowest in our industry. As noted previously, given the global nature of our business, we plan to opportunistically raise additional debt capital in low rate markets where we intend to expand, creating both incremental debt capital to fund our growth but also placing a natural hedge into these markets. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were $648 million, including recurring CapEx of $45 million. We continue to invest across our platform with 54 major projects currently underway in 36 markets in 24 countries, including 15 xScale scale projects. Since our last earnings call, we opened 10 projects across 8 metros, including new data centers in Johor, Osaka, Silicon Valley and Warsaw. We also purchased our Helsinki 5 and Madrid 2 assets and land for development in Atlanta, Dallas and Milan. Revenues from owned assets increased to 69% of our recurring revenues and more than 80% of our current retail expansion will be on our own land or own buildings with long-term ground leases. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. 180 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Stabilized assets were collectively 83% utilized and generated a 26% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP invested. And finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for an updated summary of 2024 guidance and bridges. Do note all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. For the full year 2024, we're maintaining our underlying revenue outlook with expected top line growth of 7% to 8%. This reflects our solid execution in the first half of the year and a strong pipeline to drive momentum in the second half of the year. We're raising our underlying 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance by another $15 million due to strong operating performance and lower integration costs. We're raising our underlying 2024 AFFO guidance by $15 million, an 11% to 13% increase over the previous year. AFFO per share is expected to grow between 9% and 11% at or above the top end of our long-term plan as we continue to compound value for our shareholders. And finally, 2024 CapEx is expected to range between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion, including about $240 million of recurring CapEx. So let me stop here. I will turn the call back to Adaire.\nAdaire Fox-Martin: Thank you, Keith. In closing, we had a strong first half of 2024. We stand apart from our competitors by seamlessly integrating a global footprint with cutting-edge infrastructure. This allows us to effectively address the wide range of opportunities in the era of AI from the training needs of the service providers to the business needs of our enterprise customers. It also positions us to continue to effectively address the broader set of demands of our customer base. We believe our unwavering commitment to discipline, simplicity and focus. Combined with our amplified go-to-market efforts, we'll continue to drive growth and deliver higher value for our employees, customers, partners and shareholders. With that, I'll stop here and open it up to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Hi, thank you, good evening. Adaire, congratulations on the new position. And thank you for the comments on your Listening Tour. And where you see the opportunities. I'd love to get your high-level perspective on what led you to take the role at Equinix. Obviously, you've known them from the Board, but you came from Google, you worked at SAP before that. So you've got a great perspective on the cloud needs of the hyperscalers, the AI opportunity. So it'd be great if you could just put all of that into context on where you see Equinix being positioned for the training, but particularly for the inference wave of AI? Thank you.\nAdaire Fox-Martin: Thanks very much for the question, Simon, and thank you for the kind words. It's certainly being a whirlwind of 10 weeks since I formally took the position and a lot that I've heard and understood during the listening and learning sessions. I have to say I remain exceptionally positive about the opportunity ahead. One of the reasons or one of the main reasons or one of the many reasons actually why I took the role with Equinix is obviously understanding the strategy of the company and its unique position in the ecosystem. I believe that Equinix is uniquely positioned to offer a range of enabling services for our customers so that they can actually capitalize on the opportunities presented by various different technology platforms. When I think about our demand and the customer needs, it is actually much broader than the AI portfolio. Many of our customers have made a very significant commitment to hybrid and to multi-cloud. And as customers become more at ease with cloud as a technology paradigm, we can see many more workload-based decisions beginning to occur. So decisions about where particular workloads are best suited. As I look at this in the context of AI and the AI demand, that initial short-term demand is coming indeed from the service providers. And this is reflected in our xScale business and in the bookings performance that we've seen in the xScale business. And as you heard in our remarks, this is something that we're looking to expand globally. But many CIOs like during the early days of cloud are looking to ensure that they have an AI strategy. And we are beginning to see the beginnings of enterprise training and enterprise funnel as we look at customers, looking to evolve their strategy into proof-of-concept and beyond that into working production systems. As I said, I think retail will have a much broader demand and a more meaningful long-term upside from AI as these use cases move from proof-of-concepts into production. There is, of course, a lot that Equinix is offering to our customers here, both in our retail business and of course, on the xScale side of the house. And I think this unique balanced approach to the opportunity represented in the broader demand context but also in the era of cloud is something that's extremely exciting. I'm looking forward to leading the company through this journey.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks for your thoughts.\nAdaire Fox-Martin: Thank you Simon.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Nick Del Deo from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nNicholas Del Deo: Hey Afternoon. Again congratulations, Adaire on taking the helm. Adaire you had mentioned simplification focus and amplifying go-to-market as some of the areas that seemed interesting to you initially. I guess, can you expand a little bit on what you saw and things you might see on that front in the coming years?\nAdaire Fox-Martin: For sure. Thank you very much again for the congrats Nick. I appreciate that. First of all, when I look at the overall approach that I will take, it is about creating value, and it will always have a customer lens an outside-in perspective ensuring that customer success translates and is equal to Equinix success in many regards. When I look at this, this means looking at how we continue to evolve the product portfolio, how we continue to drive critical partnerships so that we're at the center of the digital ecosystem and how we continue to enhance and evolve our go-to-market engine. Let me specifically pick up on the notion of simplification. When one simplifies, you bring core processes back to their very core. This enables you to be agile in your response and helps you to accelerate the underpinning pace of the business. And whilst this list is not exhaustive, there are definitely a few areas that I see we have some opportunity to continue to evolve and simplify things like our quote-to-cash process, elements like our customer life cycle and ways that we can systematize and process the customer's journey with us throughout their life cycle. These type of enterprise-grade processes will help us remove friction within the system and help deliver that pace, agility and simplicity. When I look at it from a focus point of view, it is about understanding not just the footprint that's in our core, but how we continue to grow and evolve our core business, to meet the needs of our customers. And this is both in our xScale business but also on retail, where we look at how our global footprint enables customers to operate and transact in environments where they may not need to invest in the physical infrastructure themselves to do that. I also think that focus is an important point when we consider our digital services portfolio and look at this through the lens of where we have adjacency, and augmenting some of that core functionality that we have that exists in the core footprint of the Equinix data center world. This is a point where we have the right to win where customers would expect us to lead. And so for instance, I look at the underpinning growth in our fabric business, how important that can be as we look to continue to evolve our virtual interconnections portfolio. And this enables us to focus in perhaps on certain aspects of our product portfolio in order to ensure that we're investing where we can have the highest level of returns. And on our go-to-market side, we have new leadership in our go-to-market team. I think it's a very important aspect of our business to underpin our go-to-market processes with a very clear segmentation strategy that allows us to identify those customers that have the highest revenue perspective for us and to manage those customers in a high-touch environment but likewise, to enable us to extend our reach through channels and distribution effectively to customers who are in SME more general business type space. So I hope that's given you a little bit of amplification on simplicity, focus and the actual augmentation of our go-to-market. Thank you for the question, Nick\nNicholas Del Deo: Yes. That was terrific detail. Can I follow up with 1 on interconnection adds. Obviously, they dropped quite a bit sequentially. I think you called out optimization, grooming and content and networking as drivers of that, but also noted strong adds. Maybe can you just expand a little bit on those puts and takes and how we should think about the path to getting interconnection adds back to a healthier and more sustainable level?\nAdaire Fox-Martin: I'm happy to comment on that, and I can ask any of my colleagues here to us if there's anything that they would need to add to my commentary. So first of all, as we noted, we had 3,900 net adds. We had, as Keith mentioned in his comments, the StackPath liquidation, which impacted us negatively 400. And so without that, we would have had 4,300 adds. Now let me just unpack some of the trends for you, Nick, to build on your question. First, on the positive side. When I look at the gross adds, it's the highest level in 2 years. And year-to-date, this interconnection demand is actually back to peak pandemic levels. In absolute numbers, our A-to-Z connections continue to increase, and we've seen this quarter-over-quarter. And this is obviously the way that we define unique relationships between companies in a metro. And I think this really truly speaks to the value of Equinix. So those things coupled together, the gross adds, the absolute number of A to Z continuing to increase. The fact that we're at a peak pandemic levels, I think they are very good indicators of future momentum. Pricing is also trending very favorably. We have 11% spread between churn and new additions. And you see revenue up to 9% year-on-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. So a number of positives as we look at the interconnection lens. On the churn side, we saw the churn elevated in 2023 and continued to worsen in early 2024. And this was up especially in the EMEA Theater of operation. I think networks have had the most toughest operating environment, and we're continuing to see pressure in that segment of our industry customers. I would also say that M&A affects this where we have paid cross connects, but unpaid intercompany cross connects and often replacing those in an M&A trajectory, and this takes some time for us to work through. But specifically, as it relates to EMEA, we can see that the data indicating some decelerating churn rate from the top 10 who have been churning in the past. So that again gives me the confidence to say that I can believe we'll move forward on a positive trajectory here, and this is an area of focus for me as we move forward over the course of this quarter.\nNicholas Del Deo: That\u2019s great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Hey guys, thank you so much for taking questions and Adair, welcome. I guess I have to be the one to ask. So obviously, the DOJ, SEC subpoenas [ph] continue to kind of be subject of conversation around the company. So I guess if you could kind of give us an update on where we are and what we'll take to put that to bed to be great. Also, a follow-up on that is in the aftermath of the conclusion of the independent review conducted by the Board. Were there any changes that you guys have made in this past quarter with respect to any kind of internal or external reporting? And then the last one, if I could, Keith, you referenced the unadjusted cabinets. I think this is the third or fourth quarter in a row. We had to talk about why cabinets are in volume terms living up to expectations. And it's because of the densities and the better revenue per cabinet where we are kind of coming up with some language that represents the adjustment that you think investors need to see when they read the release or the first time around? Thanks.\nAdaire Fox-Martin: Okay. David, thank you very much for the words of welcome. Maybe we'll start with the muted -- the cabinet growth scenario. I'll throw that to Keith and then he can perhaps comment on the kind of investigation status.\nKeith Taylor: David. So first and foremost, look, we continue to see the net cabinet billings as an area of high focus. As I said sort of in the prepared remarks, roughly 300 of those cabinets related to StackPath announced their liquidation at the end of the quarter. Put that aside, there's a number of things that are impacting. And one of them I'll refer to and why we say unadjusted. But capacity constraints, of course, has continued to have an impact on base of the net cabinets billing and then the timing of churn, which is an obvious statement. The increasing density continues to be a factor. And as we said, there's two things I wanted to pull out for you. As I said in the prepared remarks, but I want to make sure that it's understood in its fullest context. First and foremost, we had record gross bookings. So it gives you a sense that the volume in the businesses is there. So that gives me great confidence, and we had record gross bookings in the Americas theater more specifically. You add to that that we had the best net megawatts billing in the retail space. I'm not talking about xScale in retail, and that tells in the last seven quarters. So this is six quarters prior, we've done meaningfully better than we had done before. So it tells you about the health of the underlying business and it really ties into what Adaire was talking about on the sort of gross interconnects. So there's the volume there. But there's this element of the business both on how things are timing out. We knew -- as you know, we're sort of forecasting Q2 would be probably a negative quarter again. There's the timing of the churn. But when I talk about the unadjusted is we do that -- we can do that math for you, which basically says, well, when you turn out a certain number of cabinets at that level of density and you apply different factors to it with a higher level of density, you're basically dealing with a whole of roughly 2,000 just because of density. And so that's why we say the unadjusted. I think the most important thing is that, look, we've given you a good sense of there's great momentum in the business. We're seeing great gross values. Yes, there's an element of churn that's coming through the business. We've been talking about that for many quarters now, the economic climate in which we operate. But overall, with the depth of the pipeline and the momentum we see in our business, that's what gives us confidence that you're going to see that abate. And then the last part I would just say is the backlog has been as high as we've seen in a very long period of time and it's substantial. Not a surprise, largely because we did more medium to larger-sized deals in the quarter. And when you do that, you have some level of extension in the book-to-bill interval, and therefore, the backlog does creep up as we work to to configure those deployments and get them into implementation. So hopefully, that answers that question. And let me then just go over to the DOJ, which I think Adaire was going to pass to me anyway, no surprise to you. We're continuing to work with the SEC and the DOJ. It's a process. We're working through that process. We continue to feel very confident in that process and how we're responding to it. I would like you to draw great comfort from the fact that not only did we file our 10-Q last quarter, but today, we filed our 10-Q today. And so when you think about the reinforcement we got from the Audit Committee's investigation of our financials, you should draw great comfort from it. But like anything, with the short seller report as it comes out and the following subpoenas that came from the SEC and DOJ, we have to respond to it and therefore, it is a process. In your question to -- was there anything that came out of what we want to do differently? I think it was very important when you look at what we announced in May, we were clear that not only did we not have any restatements but we didn't have any adjustments. Restatements is a fact about materiality. Adjustment is an adjustment. And so the system is working as it should, which is great. We have the controls, the team does the work. And overall, we feel very confident about it. But like anything, you're always are going to step back and reflect that there are other things that we could do that are different. And so that's where the team, they're looking at all the things that we do and saying, do we do different type of disclosures. You saw us recently talk about the redevelopment CapEx, which we thought one was a very important disclosure, we had already been planning for it in advance of the short seller report, but those are the kind of things that we just -- we make sure that there's appropriate augmentation of policy and disclosure, And I think it puts us in a much better position. But relating to, is there any adjustments? The answer is no. But we always think that there's things we can do better. And I'm drawing from a line of one of my co-CFO friends, he always says better, better, never done because we're always looking to do better every single quarter. And we're never going to be done. So we'll take the advice and guidance from both the council and whether anything comes back from DOJ and SEC, and we'll get better. But overall, I feel very comfortable in our financial disclosures.\nDavid Barden: Alright guys, thank you so much. Thank you both.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJames Schneider: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions and welcome, Adaire. I was wondering if you can maybe expand on your comments earlier about AI workloads moving from service providers to enterprise. From your vantage point, how long do you believe it will be before that AI demand becomes more directly material on the enterprise side to Equinix on the sort of conventional retail side?\nAdaire Fox-Martin: Thanks very much, Jim, and thanks for your question and your words of welcome. I think in the short term, the demand that we're seeing is primarily for training based workloads. This is primarily driven in the short term by cloud and the various different technology partners that we have. And this, as I've mentioned, is how our near-term pipeline is being represented and the beneficiary of this in many instances is our xScale business. In the enterprise mid-market retail business, we absolutely have AI-ready data centers, ready to take customer workloads. We have already closed a number of transactions where we are running smaller, AI-based workload scenarios in the training world for enterprise-based customers. We are working with many of our CIOs to support their AI strategy as they look to integrate AI into their business and manage their cost whilst they're doing so. And of course, some of our ecosystem partners have created almost a magnetism around Equinix as it relates to AI, companies like CoreWeave and Lambda that we announced last year in 2023, who have capabilities available today in Equinix data centers and, of course, the NVIDIA DGX private cloud offering that we also announced late in 2023. All of these have very active work pipelines. Some of them have active users who are making use of this system now. So I'd say that we're seeing early traction in the enterprise level inference and type workloads beginning to occur in our data center environment. But that is something that we'll see extrapolate and grow over the medium to longer term.\nJames Schneider: Thanks. And then as a follow-up, last quarter, you outlined your plan for your DC1 data center to both modernize and expand capacity. As you look across your portfolio, do you foresee the opportunity to do this more broadly across more facilities?\nKeith Taylor: Yes. I think, Jim, you're referring to our DC2 redevelopment, if I'm not mistaken.\nJames Schneider: DC2, excuse me.\nKeith Taylor: And I just want to make sure. We think the universe of what we call redevelopment projects like that is 5 to 7-ish. They're strategic, they have scale, they are of size and of great importance. We're doing those type of redevelopments because of the value that we get to create introduce more capacity into that highly connected data center and get a good return, not only a good return on both the element of it, which is redevelopment, but also the enhancement aspect of it. And so overall, the universe isn't massive. We have 264 data centers, as Adaire alluded to, we think is 5 to 7 strategic assets strewn throughout the world that we'll do that, too.\nJames Schneider: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Michael Elias from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMichael Elias: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. And Adaire, congratulations on taking the helm. Maybe to kick things off, one of the things that we've noticed is the differential in densities between what's being churned and what's coming in. As I think through kind of the evolution at the chip level, it seems like there's an acceleration in power consumption there. Do you view this as a structural trend, i.e., we could be talking about 4 or 5 quarters from now, you taking in cabinets at 7 kW per cab and churning at 4. Thus, this represents an increasing headwind to that cabinet number. I guess that's my first question. Just trying to get a sense around is this going to become a greater and greater headwind?\nAdaire Fox-Martin: Yes. 10 weeks in. So this is certainly one of the areas that I've done a little bit of a double click on here. And I can certainly see that there are absolutely some shifting dynamics in the business. And Keith highlighted this increasing power density in the cabs that are churning in versus, as you pointed, those that are churning out. And for us, perhaps, this is something where we would look to see the billable cabs as a measure, maybe not being as tightly tied to revenue growth as we've seen it in the past. And that's something that I think we're reflecting on. If I think about our xScale business, kilowatts probably is a cleaner metric. But when I think about it from retail, our MRR per cab and our billable cabs that, perhaps, is the right P times Q math that we have now, even though growth is probably more weighted towards the cabin yield versus the cabin count at this point. And I think that we can continue to supplement that with quarterly insights into how we're seeing the density evolve as our business evolves and as the capabilities within our data centers continue to evolve. So it's certainly something that's a whole process for us here. I think as Keith mentioned, just to reiterate, I think those very strong gross bookings plus the leading indicator of cabinets sold, not yet installed are indicators that we will improve on this number in the second half.\nKeith Taylor: And maybe, Michael, if I can just add on to what Adaire said. I think it's important, as Adaire said, look, we got to keep on looking at and David asked the question earlier on, we wanted to be able to respond to it in a way that absolutely makes sense and give you all the statistics at least, so you can have the same sort of view that we have. Clearly, the shifting dynamics is more density. So that's a positive. But I think what's really -- the crux of what is going to come here, if you have more density, you your price per unit is going up and you're seeing that in the ARPU or the MR per cabinet. But we're also -- when we look to monetize the capital that we invest in the business, no surprise to you, we're looking at a return on that investment. But those targeted IRRs are 20% to 30% fee leverage. And so you're seeing the cash-on-cash yield still deliver. But that one core metric really feels like it's, again, something that I think makes sense to keep on tracking. But we're really going to have to give you other components so that you get the full value of what's going on in the business. But the underlying bias is more density and that's how -- where retail is multi-tenant data center player, you need to deal with the changing shifts in customer expectations. And that -- when you go into one of our data centers, you get a real good feel for that, the true difference between something may be in 1 aisle versus something in a different aisle and that tells you like there are shifting dynamics taking place in a really live environment, and it is an ecosystem that thrives with a propensity to increase density.\nMichael Elias: Great, thanks for the color there. And if I could just squeeze one more in. I believe the expectation at the beginning of the year was for churn to step down in the back half. Is that still your expectation? And maybe as part of that, could you give us a sense for the churn that you're seeing among medium and small-sized deployments? Thanks.\nAdaire Fox-Martin: Yes. I'll comment on this, and then perhaps, Keith, feel free to add. I mean, certainly, we're seeing that our churn in the range of 2% to 2.5%, which is the range that we guided to is something that we can continue to manage to. I think that if we normalized for StackPath in this quarter, we'd have been slightly better than our expectations in terms of where we landed. We also have a supply and demand situation in the market, which has a very positive trajectory on pricing. So maybe this gives us the opportunity to be thoughtful about managing our overall churn dynamic so that we could selectively use proactive churn to help us drive and improve some yields here. I see that some of the challenges that we had in the first half will still exist at the macro level. There's certainly there's need for customers across all industry segments to do more with less. Optimization is still something that customers are looking to do because it does give them that outcome on the more with less tangent. And we definitely have a number of our customers who are in a tougher environment in terms of the industry that they're operating in and the dynamics of that industry. That being said, we see that we will be managing within our full year as per the guide to the ranges that we set. And then I guess, just from a thought process incoming to this, in the world of cloud, this is quite a usual process. I think that there is an opportunity for us to look at some -- to some enhancements in terms of management and proactive management early on of our customer engaged with us as it relates to their use profile and intention to churn. And so I think there is a potential for us to lean in and support our customers as they optimize and to engage in churn-type discussions much earlier in the process than we've been doing thus far.\nKeith Taylor: Michael, maybe I just -- I'll just add on one additional thing given Adaire's comments. Through the second half of the year, the pipeline is deep. The underlying expectation really is to see, obviously, our gross booking activity continuing to go up. We expect churn is going to be consistent with how we've previously guided, which is important. And then in the fourth quarter, we've already sort of telegraphed we're working with one customer in Singapore that is coming in size. That we're asking -- we're working with them to vacate the premises. We will update you on that by the time we get to the back end of the third quarter. So on the October call, but that's the one area that is a [indiscernible] churn. It was built into our guide. And as I said, it should happen by the end of the year and that gives us back some very valuable capacity in Singapore that we'd like to have to put to our use and our Singapore 6 asset isn't going to be available until probably sometime in late 2026, I would think by the time it's up and running.\nMichael Elias: Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. And Adaire, congratulations on the new role. I'd like to get your thoughts on the addressable market for your retail data center services maybe in a slightly different way. So the deck -- the presentation deck cites that you have about 2,000 networks, over 4,800 enterprises, and I think about 3,000 cloud and IT service providers. And when you look at the opportunity for future revenue growth, curious how much more room do you have to grow the customers in each of these verticals relative to the opportunity to increase the spend from the customers that you have. And then just a follow-up, if I could, as well. Keith, just following up from your comments about second half influences. When we take a look at the constant currency, normalized ex-PPI revenue growth for the last two quarters, it seems like the first half average was roughly 8%, which is at the high end of the 7% to 8% target for the year. And then you made comments, I think, a few times now on the gross bookings environment, the pipeline. So can you share a bit more of what's happening in the back half of the year that's meeting the annual range at that 7% to 8%. Thanks.\nAdaire Fox-Martin: You want to take that first, Keith?\nKeith Taylor: Yes, sure. I will do the first one.\nAdaire Fox-Martin: Yes, I'll take first or you go first.\nKeith Taylor: Why don't I take it? Let me take the second half of the year, first, Michael, if I may. Look, the -- it's not lost on you, and I'm sure all the other listeners that the business is performing well. The one thing that has been persistent is although we're comfortable with the range of churn, our ability to guide, it has been persistently high, and we had a tough fourth quarter in 2023, and that translates into momentum into 2024. That all said, when you look at this particular quarter, 21.59 [ph], there's an element of quarter-over-quarter currency movement. We've given you all those numbers. I won't repeat them. We also felt the drag related to energy. As you know, we have -- we're going through power price decreases. Then we had this one-off large charge to our recurring revenues that, that we booked in the quarter. To size it for you, it's roughly $7 million. And so there's a number of things that sort of have affected the sequential movement quarter-over-quarter. And that's on the recurring side of it. There's great variability in the non-recurring. We'll do our best to guide you each quarter on what's going on. Suffice it to say, the success in the xScale business has created some volatility with nonrecurring and we'll reconcile that and normalize it out for next year as well, just so you can truly get the sense of how the underlying business is performing. So all that said, we said that churn would slow down in the second half of the year and our bookings would accelerate. The pipeline is at the highest level we have ever seen in our business. So that's good churn. We have, I think, good visibility to. And as a result, that's the momentum you're seeing that you should see in the business. And so we continue to remain confident. And as Adaire said, despite the macroeconomic conditions, we know they're tough out there. Companies like StackPath when they hit the wall at full speed and just liquidate, it gives you a sense that some companies aren't doing well out there. But you've got an evolving economic environment. We know our relevance. We know the digital environment is very friendly to Equinix, and we know the supply environment is going to continue to get more constrained. So the combination of all of that continues to give us the optimism that we have, not only in how we exit year but also how we position ourselves for 2025 again, you know what our lighthouse metric is, is driving value on a per share basis. That is our whole intention. But we believe we can do that with both good fiscal management and top line growth. So hopefully, that gives you the answer that you're looking for.\nAdaire Fox-Martin: And perhaps, just building on that and to address the first part of the question around the opportunity in our installed base and new market opportunities. This is something that I feel very, very positive about. Not only have we undertaken or already commenced a very deep refresh of our segmentation of our customer base. But in the context of that, we have looked at each of those elements and how we can create sales place scenarios that allow us to have almost like a rinse-and-repeat model from a selling perspective into a cohort of customers. So very excited about the upsell opportunity as a result of some of those programs in our installed base, but also about the outcomes of the segmentation exercise and the way that we will define our coverage model to enable us to reach further to prospects and bring them into the Equinix family as customers. So a piece of work that's underway, and I'm very confident about the prognosis and outcome of that work.\nChip Newcom: Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. This concludes our Q2 call.\nOperator: Thank you all for participating in the Equinix Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. That concludes today's conference. Please disconnect at this time, and have great rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Keith Taylor",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Adaire. Now let me first say, I look forward to the next phase of the Equinix journey alongside you and I know it's going to be a very exciting time for all of us at Equinix. And also good afternoon to all of those that are on the call today or who might be listening later. So to start, we had a great second quarter as the team continued to execute against our plans. We had record gross bookings, closing more than 4,000 deals with more than 3,000 customers. We continued our trend of net positive pricing actions, and we ended the quarter with solid net bookings. Our forward-looking pipeline remains deep, which we expect will drive momentum in the second half of the year, and we're delivering profitability ahead of our expectations. As a result, we're again raising our full year adjusted EBITDA and AFFO guidance, and therefore, AFFO per share too, our lighthouse metric. Also, as Adaire highlighted, I'm excited about the next phase of our xScale initiatives. We plan to lean into this program as we've seen strong demand from this offering -- for this offering, as evidenced by both our cloud and AI bookings momentum. We continue to believe this off-balance sheet JV structure with our equity partners is the right model to pursue this significant opportunity, which also drives durable value on a per share basis. To date, through the xScale JVs, we've invested about $4.7 billion in the program. Since our last earnings call, we leased an incremental 17 megawatts of capacity in our Silicon Valley 12 and Paris 13 assets. This brings our total global xScale leasing to 365 megawatts, representing nearly $6 billion of total contract value and more than $700 million of annualized revenue once these assets are fully ramped. Looking forward, we have a strong funnel of additional xScale opportunities and we look forward to updating you on our future JV partnerships in the near term. For non-financial metrics, MR per cabinet is rising, increasing 7% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis to $2,287 per cabinet, driven by favorable pricing environment, solid interconnection attach rates and increasing prior densities. As discussed on our last earnings call, as expected, we saw continued pressure on our unadjusted net cabinets billing metric due to capacity constraints in certain key markets, increasing power density and timing of churn. StackPath unexpectedly announced their immediate liquidation in June, resulting in 300 cabinets churning at quarter end as an example. Related to cabinet density, the Q2 cabinet churn were on an average density of 4 kilowatts per cabinet while the new cabinets booked were at an average density of 5.9 kilowatts per cabinet. In Q2, non-xScale net megawatts sold increased meaningfully compared to the prior six quarters. As we look forward, given our strong gross bookings and as a result, the rising backlog of cabinets sold but not yet installed, we expect billable cabinets to improve in the second half of the year. On the sustainability front, we're continuing to advance our bold Future First agenda, implementing innovative ways to integrate into the communities in which we operate. This includes new heat export programs across Europe and the Americas, including our new Paris 10 IBX, which helps heat a portion of the aquatic center at the Paris Olympics. This is one example of a sustainability initiative that we believe will become commonplace in the markets we serve in the future. Now let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. As depicted on Slide 4, Global Q2 revenues were $2.59 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year and in the upper half of our guidance range on a constant currency basis, including the impact of a one-off charge against recurring revenues. As expected, non-recurring revenue stepped up sequentially due to strong xScale leasing activity in the quarter. Q2 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $6 million headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates due to the weaker Brazilian real and the Japanese yen in the quarter. Global Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $1.036 billion or 48% of revenues, up 17% over the same quarter last year and above the $1 billion quarterly threshold for the very first time. Relative to our expectations, adjusted EBITDA was at the top end of our guidance range due to strong operating profits and timing of spend. Q2-adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, included a $3 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and $4 million of integration costs. Global Q2 AFFO was $877 million, up 17% over the same quarter last year, better than our expectations due to strong operating performance and the timing of the land lease payment related to our upcoming Singapore 6 build. Q2 AFFO included a $3 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q2 MRR churn was 2.3%. For the balance of the year, we expect MRR churn to remain in the 2% to 2.5% quarterly guidance range. Turning to our regional highlights, the results, which are covered on Slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized basis, APAC was our fastest-growing region at 11%, followed by the Americas and EMEA regions growing at 9% and 5%, respectively. The Americas region had a great quarter with record gross bookings led by strong financial services activity, firm pricing and a higher mix of medium and large footprint deals. We saw particular strength in our Tier 1 markets, including Dallas, New York, Washington, D.C. Our EMEA business delivered a solid quarter with healthy bookings activity and strong pricing. The team did an excellent job selling our global platform with record exports and strong intra-region activity, including into growth in emerging markets such as Abu Dhabi, Istanbul and Warsaw. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a strong quarter with momentum in our largest markets in the region, including Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo as well as strong customer interest in our new Asian metros. Encouragingly, we saw strong intra-region activity driven by customers deploying AI workloads in both Japan and Malaysia. And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our balance sheet increased to approximately $33 billion, including an unrestricted cash balance of $2 billion. Our cash balance increased quarter-over-quarter due to strong operating cash flow and the debt raised in the quarter, offset by our growth investments and the cash dividend. In May, we raised $750 million of senior U.S. dollar notes due in 2034, and we immediately swapped these notes into euros at an effective interest rate of 3.9%. Our net leverage remains low relative to our peers of 3.5x our annualized adjusted EBITDA. Our blended debt borrowing rate is now 2.4%, the lowest in our industry. As noted previously, given the global nature of our business, we plan to opportunistically raise additional debt capital in low rate markets where we intend to expand, creating both incremental debt capital to fund our growth but also placing a natural hedge into these markets. Turning to Slide 9 for the quarter. Capital expenditures were $648 million, including recurring CapEx of $45 million. We continue to invest across our platform with 54 major projects currently underway in 36 markets in 24 countries, including 15 xScale scale projects. Since our last earnings call, we opened 10 projects across 8 metros, including new data centers in Johor, Osaka, Silicon Valley and Warsaw. We also purchased our Helsinki 5 and Madrid 2 assets and land for development in Atlanta, Dallas and Milan. Revenues from owned assets increased to 69% of our recurring revenues and more than 80% of our current retail expansion will be on our own land or own buildings with long-term ground leases. Our capital investments delivered strong returns as shown on Slide 10. 180 stabilized assets increased recurring revenues by 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Stabilized assets were collectively 83% utilized and generated a 26% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP invested. And finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for an updated summary of 2024 guidance and bridges. Do note all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. For the full year 2024, we're maintaining our underlying revenue outlook with expected top line growth of 7% to 8%. This reflects our solid execution in the first half of the year and a strong pipeline to drive momentum in the second half of the year. We're raising our underlying 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance by another $15 million due to strong operating performance and lower integration costs. We're raising our underlying 2024 AFFO guidance by $15 million, an 11% to 13% increase over the previous year. AFFO per share is expected to grow between 9% and 11% at or above the top end of our long-term plan as we continue to compound value for our shareholders. And finally, 2024 CapEx is expected to range between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion, including about $240 million of recurring CapEx. So let me stop here. I will turn the call back to Adaire. David. So first and foremost, look, we continue to see the net cabinet billings as an area of high focus. As I said sort of in the prepared remarks, roughly 300 of those cabinets related to StackPath announced their liquidation at the end of the quarter. Put that aside, there's a number of things that are impacting. And one of them I'll refer to and why we say unadjusted. But capacity constraints, of course, has continued to have an impact on base of the net cabinets billing and then the timing of churn, which is an obvious statement. The increasing density continues to be a factor. And as we said, there's two things I wanted to pull out for you. As I said in the prepared remarks, but I want to make sure that it's understood in its fullest context. First and foremost, we had record gross bookings. So it gives you a sense that the volume in the businesses is there. So that gives me great confidence, and we had record gross bookings in the Americas theater more specifically. You add to that that we had the best net megawatts billing in the retail space. I'm not talking about xScale in retail, and that tells in the last seven quarters. So this is six quarters prior, we've done meaningfully better than we had done before. So it tells you about the health of the underlying business and it really ties into what Adaire was talking about on the sort of gross interconnects. So there's the volume there. But there's this element of the business both on how things are timing out. We knew -- as you know, we're sort of forecasting Q2 would be probably a negative quarter again. There's the timing of the churn. But when I talk about the unadjusted is we do that -- we can do that math for you, which basically says, well, when you turn out a certain number of cabinets at that level of density and you apply different factors to it with a higher level of density, you're basically dealing with a whole of roughly 2,000 just because of density. And so that's why we say the unadjusted. I think the most important thing is that, look, we've given you a good sense of there's great momentum in the business. We're seeing great gross values. Yes, there's an element of churn that's coming through the business. We've been talking about that for many quarters now, the economic climate in which we operate. But overall, with the depth of the pipeline and the momentum we see in our business, that's what gives us confidence that you're going to see that abate. And then the last part I would just say is the backlog has been as high as we've seen in a very long period of time and it's substantial. Not a surprise, largely because we did more medium to larger-sized deals in the quarter. And when you do that, you have some level of extension in the book-to-bill interval, and therefore, the backlog does creep up as we work to to configure those deployments and get them into implementation. So hopefully, that answers that question. And let me then just go over to the DOJ, which I think Adaire was going to pass to me anyway, no surprise to you. We're continuing to work with the SEC and the DOJ. It's a process. We're working through that process. We continue to feel very confident in that process and how we're responding to it. I would like you to draw great comfort from the fact that not only did we file our 10-Q last quarter, but today, we filed our 10-Q today. And so when you think about the reinforcement we got from the Audit Committee's investigation of our financials, you should draw great comfort from it. But like anything, with the short seller report as it comes out and the following subpoenas that came from the SEC and DOJ, we have to respond to it and therefore, it is a process. In your question to -- was there anything that came out of what we want to do differently? I think it was very important when you look at what we announced in May, we were clear that not only did we not have any restatements but we didn't have any adjustments. Restatements is a fact about materiality. Adjustment is an adjustment. And so the system is working as it should, which is great. We have the controls, the team does the work. And overall, we feel very confident about it. But like anything, you're always are going to step back and reflect that there are other things that we could do that are different. And so that's where the team, they're looking at all the things that we do and saying, do we do different type of disclosures. You saw us recently talk about the redevelopment CapEx, which we thought one was a very important disclosure, we had already been planning for it in advance of the short seller report, but those are the kind of things that we just -- we make sure that there's appropriate augmentation of policy and disclosure, And I think it puts us in a much better position. But relating to, is there any adjustments? The answer is no. But we always think that there's things we can do better. And I'm drawing from a line of one of my co-CFO friends, he always says better, better, never done because we're always looking to do better every single quarter. And we're never going to be done. So we'll take the advice and guidance from both the council and whether anything comes back from DOJ and SEC, and we'll get better. But overall, I feel very comfortable in our financial disclosures. Yes. I think, Jim, you're referring to our DC2 redevelopment, if I'm not mistaken. And I just want to make sure. We think the universe of what we call redevelopment projects like that is 5 to 7-ish. They're strategic, they have scale, they are of size and of great importance. We're doing those type of redevelopments because of the value that we get to create introduce more capacity into that highly connected data center and get a good return, not only a good return on both the element of it, which is redevelopment, but also the enhancement aspect of it. And so overall, the universe isn't massive. We have 264 data centers, as Adaire alluded to, we think is 5 to 7 strategic assets strewn throughout the world that we'll do that, too. And maybe, Michael, if I can just add on to what Adaire said. I think it's important, as Adaire said, look, we got to keep on looking at and David asked the question earlier on, we wanted to be able to respond to it in a way that absolutely makes sense and give you all the statistics at least, so you can have the same sort of view that we have. Clearly, the shifting dynamics is more density. So that's a positive. But I think what's really -- the crux of what is going to come here, if you have more density, you your price per unit is going up and you're seeing that in the ARPU or the MR per cabinet. But we're also -- when we look to monetize the capital that we invest in the business, no surprise to you, we're looking at a return on that investment. But those targeted IRRs are 20% to 30% fee leverage. And so you're seeing the cash-on-cash yield still deliver. But that one core metric really feels like it's, again, something that I think makes sense to keep on tracking. But we're really going to have to give you other components so that you get the full value of what's going on in the business. But the underlying bias is more density and that's how -- where retail is multi-tenant data center player, you need to deal with the changing shifts in customer expectations. And that -- when you go into one of our data centers, you get a real good feel for that, the true difference between something may be in 1 aisle versus something in a different aisle and that tells you like there are shifting dynamics taking place in a really live environment, and it is an ecosystem that thrives with a propensity to increase density. Michael, maybe I just -- I'll just add on one additional thing given Adaire's comments. Through the second half of the year, the pipeline is deep. The underlying expectation really is to see, obviously, our gross booking activity continuing to go up. We expect churn is going to be consistent with how we've previously guided, which is important. And then in the fourth quarter, we've already sort of telegraphed we're working with one customer in Singapore that is coming in size. That we're asking -- we're working with them to vacate the premises. We will update you on that by the time we get to the back end of the third quarter. So on the October call, but that's the one area that is a [indiscernible] churn. It was built into our guide. And as I said, it should happen by the end of the year and that gives us back some very valuable capacity in Singapore that we'd like to have to put to our use and our Singapore 6 asset isn't going to be available until probably sometime in late 2026, I would think by the time it's up and running. Yes, sure. I will do the first one. Why don't I take it? Let me take the second half of the year, first, Michael, if I may. Look, the -- it's not lost on you, and I'm sure all the other listeners that the business is performing well. The one thing that has been persistent is although we're comfortable with the range of churn, our ability to guide, it has been persistently high, and we had a tough fourth quarter in 2023, and that translates into momentum into 2024.

We'll do our best to guide you each quarter on what's going on. Suffice it to say, the success in the xScale business has created some volatility with nonrecurring and we'll reconcile that and normalize it out for next year as well, just so you can truly get the sense of how the underlying business is performing. So all that said, we said that churn would slow down in the second half of the year and our bookings would accelerate. The pipeline is at the highest level we have ever seen in our business. So that's good churn. We have, I think, good visibility to. And as a result, that's the momentum you're seeing that you should see in the business. And so we continue to remain confident. And as Adaire said, despite the macroeconomic conditions, we know they're tough out there. Companies like StackPath when they hit the wall at full speed and just liquidate, it gives you a sense that some companies aren't doing well out there. But you've got an evolving economic environment. We know our relevance. We know the digital environment is very friendly to Equinix, and we know the supply environment is going to continue to get more constrained. So the combination of all of that continues to give us the optimism that we have, not only in how we exit year but also how we position ourselves for 2025 again, you know what our lighthouse metric is, is driving value on a per share basis. That is our whole intention. But we believe we can do that with both good fiscal management and top line growth. So hopefully, that gives you the answer that you're looking for."

            "name": "Adaire Fox-Martin",
            "content": "Thank you, Chip. Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. I'm honored to be hosting my first earnings call today as CEO and President of Equinix, I'm immensely proud to lead our dedicated team of more than 13,000 employees around the world. I would like to express my gratitude to Charles and the entire Equinix team for the warm welcome and the facilitation of a smooth transition over the past two months. I look forward to the continued partnership with Charles in his role as Executive Chairman, and I'm excited and optimistic about the road ahead. As a board member for the past four years, I've witnessed many of the unique qualities that have driven Equinix's durable success. Our 25 years of investment has built a business now spanning 264 data centers in 72 metros across six continents. Our focus on customer value and outcomes has created interconnected digital ecosystems unrivaled in our industry. It is a phenomenal foundation to build upon as CEO. As the stewards of some of the most important digital infrastructure in the world, we are exceptionally and uniquely positioned to capitalize on the immense opportunities that lie ahead. Business transformation remains a critical priority for our customers, and the emergence of AI marks a pivotal point for our industry. AI, similar to the growth of cloud technologies a decade ago, will take time to fully develop. In the near term AI training workloads are driving significant demand, particularly from service providers. Our xScale program continues to be a direct beneficiary of this demand. We intend to build on this momentum meaningfully augmenting and extending our xScale portfolio, particularly in North America. This will complement our robust portfolio across Europe and Asia Pacific. We are excited to share that we recently closed on land and power for our first multi hundred megawatt xScale campus in Atlanta. We look forward to announcing details of this project and our next xScale joint venture in the coming months. At the operational end of the AI spectrum, our network nodes and inference workloads as with cloud, Equinix continues to be the preferred location for network nodes as customers seek the right connectivity solutions for data ingestion and distribution. We also see inference demand beginning to take shape. We believe the implementation and deployment of these workloads will accelerate over the coming years. The neutrality, global reach and scale of platform Equinix can deliver the performance, network density and cloud adjacency which inference workloads will require. We are already seeing significant enterprise and service provider interest in our deployment capabilities. In Q2, we partnered with WWT to serve Almavic [ph] Technologies, an AI powered marketing analytics platform for enterprise. Almavic [ph] Technologies deployed their AI infrastructure at Equinix to run proprietary inference algorithms on massive datasets for predictable cost, privacy, speed and secure access to data sources in the cloud. InstaDeep, a leading provider of AI decision making solutions, deployed an Nvidia AI cluster at our Paris 10 asset to access key ecosystems, optimize their network, and support their growth objectives. Our approach to the market opportunity created by AI is multifaceted and we believe it will deliver value in the short term and sustainable growth over the medium to long term. Our xScale offering provides the infrastructure and expertise required for massive scalable data center operations for our cloud and large scale technology customers. For our enterprise and mid-market customers, we offer AI ready data centers and turnkey solutions, enabling them to scale efficiently and effectively as they introduce AI technologies into their business operations. For those who require high performance inferencing, our Edge solutions handle the data at the edge where it is generated, ensuring optimal performance for the next generation of business applications. Over the past two months I have embarked on a listening tour across a number of our locations, meeting with our customers, partners and employees and whilst it is still early in my tenure and there is still work that I need to complete, I have noted some areas of opportunity that will underpin our strategy for the company going forward. The opportunity to simplify across numerous aspects of our business. This will allow us to accelerate our pace of execution. The opportunity to drive more focus whilst we may do less. The programs of work that we focus on will represent excellence in execution and deliver the highest quality outcomes. The opportunity to amplify our go-to-market efforts to delight our customers and energize our partners. Equinix has consistently demonstrated discipline and execution. This mantra of discipline allows us to deliver market leading returns on capital and serves as the underlying fuel for long-term growth in AFFO per share, our core financial metric. Building on this foundation and executing on the opportunities I noted should create a simpler, more focused and ultimately higher valued company. With all of this in mind, I'll turn to our Q2 performance. Equinix had a great second quarter. We delivered record growth bookings. Our pricing remains strong. We continue to invest broadly across our offerings to further enhance the scale and reach of our industry leading platform. Our delivery of Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share continues to run ahead of expectations. As you can see on Slide three Q2 revenues were $2.2 billion, up 8% over the same quarter last year. This represents our 86th consecutive quarter of top line growth. Adjusted EBITDA was up 17% year-over-year with strong AFFO per share flow-through. Interconnection revenue stepped up to 9% year-over-year. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. In May, we announced the opening of our first data center in Johor with strong interest from customers across our new Malaysian footprint. In July, we announced our expansion into the Philippines through the planned acquisition of three data centers in Manila from Total Information Management. This transaction, valued at approximately $180 million, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, adding more than 1,000 cabinets of capacity, in addition to land for future development. The combination of our strong leadership position in our Singapore hub and our entries into Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines strategically position Equinix to help our customers capitalize on the expanding digital opportunity in the fast-growing Southeast Asia region. Customers taking advantage of our expanding global footprint include FirstDigital, an Internet and telecommunications provider. FirstDigital is significantly lowering total cost of ownership by building a multi-cloud network with Equinix Fabric Cloud Router to connect to Cisco WebEx and AWS across all three regions. Our global interconnection franchise continues to perform with over 472,000 total interconnections now deployed. Gross interconnection additions were at the highest level in 2 years and pricing continues to trend favorably. However, net interconnection adds were 3,900 due to grooming activity, primarily in our content and networking verticals. We do expect this grooming to lessen over time. Equinix Fabric growth was underpinned by 100 gigabit port additions and strong pull-through from other digital services products. Network Edge experienced continued rapid growth with an expansion activity from existing customers. The recent interconnection and ecosystem wins, include Nuam Exchange. This is a new company formed after the integration of the Santiago Lima and Colombia Stock Exchanges. Capital market participants can now benefit from Nuam's extended reach, low latency and secure connectivity supported by Equinix in key markets like New York and Sao Paulo. Our channel program delivered another solid quarter, accounting for over 30% of new bookings and 55% of company new logos. We continue to see growth from partners like AT&T, Avant, Dell, HPE and Orange business, with wins across a wide range of industry segments and use cases. Notable wins included an AI as a service solution via our distribution partner, Tech Data and MSP partner AsiaPac. Leveraging a combination of co-location and Equinix Fabric, our partners are delivering an LLM for a high-level learning institution based in Malaysia. Now before I turn the call over to Keith, I wanted to recognize that we believe we are in a position of strength financially from both a balance sheet and from an access to capital perspective. Our investment strategy delivers a strong return on invested capital, all of which gives us the flexibility to execute our go-forward strategy. With that, I'll turn it over to Keith to cover the results from the quarter. Thank you, Keith. In closing, we had a strong first half of 2024. We stand apart from our competitors by seamlessly integrating a global footprint with cutting-edge infrastructure. This allows us to effectively address the wide range of opportunities in the era of AI from the training needs of the service providers to the business needs of our enterprise customers. It also positions us to continue to effectively address the broader set of demands of our customer base. We believe our unwavering commitment to discipline, simplicity and focus. Combined with our amplified go-to-market efforts, we'll continue to drive growth and deliver higher value for our employees, customers, partners and shareholders. With that, I'll stop here and open it up to questions. Thanks very much for the question, Simon, and thank you for the kind words. It's certainly being a whirlwind of 10 weeks since I formally took the position and a lot that I've heard and understood during the listening and learning sessions. I have to say I remain exceptionally positive about the opportunity ahead. One of the reasons or one of the main reasons or one of the many reasons actually why I took the role with Equinix is obviously understanding the strategy of the company and its unique position in the ecosystem. I believe that Equinix is uniquely positioned to offer a range of enabling services for our customers so that they can actually capitalize on the opportunities presented by various different technology platforms. When I think about our demand and the customer needs, it is actually much broader than the AI portfolio. Many of our customers have made a very significant commitment to hybrid and to multi-cloud. And as customers become more at ease with cloud as a technology paradigm, we can see many more workload-based decisions beginning to occur. So decisions about where particular workloads are best suited. As I look at this in the context of AI and the AI demand, that initial short-term demand is coming indeed from the service providers. And this is reflected in our xScale business and in the bookings performance that we've seen in the xScale business. And as you heard in our remarks, this is something that we're looking to expand globally. But many CIOs like during the early days of cloud are looking to ensure that they have an AI strategy. And we are beginning to see the beginnings of enterprise training and enterprise funnel as we look at customers, looking to evolve their strategy into proof-of-concept and beyond that into working production systems. As I said, I think retail will have a much broader demand and a more meaningful long-term upside from AI as these use cases move from proof-of-concepts into production. There is, of course, a lot that Equinix is offering to our customers here, both in our retail business and of course, on the xScale side of the house. And I think this unique balanced approach to the opportunity represented in the broader demand context but also in the era of cloud is something that's extremely exciting. I'm looking forward to leading the company through this journey. Thank you Simon. For sure. Thank you very much again for the congrats Nick. I appreciate that. First of all, when I look at the overall approach that I will take, it is about creating value, and it will always have a customer lens an outside-in perspective ensuring that customer success translates and is equal to Equinix success in many regards. When I look at this, this means looking at how we continue to evolve the product portfolio, how we continue to drive critical partnerships so that we're at the center of the digital ecosystem and how we continue to enhance and evolve our go-to-market engine. Let me specifically pick up on the notion of simplification. When one simplifies, you bring core processes back to their very core. This enables you to be agile in your response and helps you to accelerate the underpinning pace of the business. And whilst this list is not exhaustive, there are definitely a few areas that I see we have some opportunity to continue to evolve and simplify things like our quote-to-cash process, elements like our customer life cycle and ways that we can systematize and process the customer's journey with us throughout their life cycle. These type of enterprise-grade processes will help us remove friction within the system and help deliver that pace, agility and simplicity. When I look at it from a focus point of view, it is about understanding not just the footprint that's in our core, but how we continue to grow and evolve our core business, to meet the needs of our customers. And this is both in our xScale business but also on retail, where we look at how our global footprint enables customers to operate and transact in environments where they may not need to invest in the physical infrastructure themselves to do that. I also think that focus is an important point when we consider our digital services portfolio and look at this through the lens of where we have adjacency, and augmenting some of that core functionality that we have that exists in the core footprint of the Equinix data center world. This is a point where we have the right to win where customers would expect us to lead. And so for instance, I look at the underpinning growth in our fabric business, how important that can be as we look to continue to evolve our virtual interconnections portfolio. And this enables us to focus in perhaps on certain aspects of our product portfolio in order to ensure that we're investing where we can have the highest level of returns. And on our go-to-market side, we have new leadership in our go-to-market team. I think it's a very important aspect of our business to underpin our go-to-market processes with a very clear segmentation strategy that allows us to identify those customers that have the highest revenue perspective for us and to manage those customers in a high-touch environment but likewise, to enable us to extend our reach through channels and distribution effectively to customers who are in SME more general business type space. So I hope that's given you a little bit of amplification on simplicity, focus and the actual augmentation of our go-to-market. Thank you for the question, Nick I'm happy to comment on that, and I can ask any of my colleagues here to us if there's anything that they would need to add to my commentary. So first of all, as we noted, we had 3,900 net adds. We had, as Keith mentioned in his comments, the StackPath liquidation, which impacted us negatively 400. And so without that, we would have had 4,300 adds. Now let me just unpack some of the trends for you, Nick, to build on your question. First, on the positive side. When I look at the gross adds, it's the highest level in 2 years. And year-to-date, this interconnection demand is actually back to peak pandemic levels. In absolute numbers, our A-to-Z connections continue to increase, and we've seen this quarter-over-quarter. And this is obviously the way that we define unique relationships between companies in a metro. And I think this really truly speaks to the value of Equinix. So those things coupled together, the gross adds, the absolute number of A to Z continuing to increase. The fact that we're at a peak pandemic levels, I think they are very good indicators of future momentum. Pricing is also trending very favorably. We have 11% spread between churn and new additions. And you see revenue up to 9% year-on-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. So a number of positives as we look at the interconnection lens. On the churn side, we saw the churn elevated in 2023 and continued to worsen in early 2024. And this was up especially in the EMEA Theater of operation. I think networks have had the most toughest operating environment, and we're continuing to see pressure in that segment of our industry customers. I would also say that M&A affects this where we have paid cross connects, but unpaid intercompany cross connects and often replacing those in an M&A trajectory, and this takes some time for us to work through. But specifically, as it relates to EMEA, we can see that the data indicating some decelerating churn rate from the top 10 who have been churning in the past. So that again gives me the confidence to say that I can believe we'll move forward on a positive trajectory here, and this is an area of focus for me as we move forward over the course of this quarter. Okay. David, thank you very much for the words of welcome. Maybe we'll start with the muted -- the cabinet growth scenario. I'll throw that to Keith and then he can perhaps comment on the kind of investigation status. Thanks very much, Jim, and thanks for your question and your words of welcome. I think in the short term, the demand that we're seeing is primarily for training based workloads. This is primarily driven in the short term by cloud and the various different technology partners that we have. And this, as I've mentioned, is how our near-term pipeline is being represented and the beneficiary of this in many instances is our xScale business. In the enterprise mid-market retail business, we absolutely have AI-ready data centers, ready to take customer workloads. We have already closed a number of transactions where we are running smaller, AI-based workload scenarios in the training world for enterprise-based customers. We are working with many of our CIOs to support their AI strategy as they look to integrate AI into their business and manage their cost whilst they're doing so. And of course, some of our ecosystem partners have created almost a magnetism around Equinix as it relates to AI, companies like CoreWeave and Lambda that we announced last year in 2023, who have capabilities available today in Equinix data centers and, of course, the NVIDIA DGX private cloud offering that we also announced late in 2023. All of these have very active work pipelines. Some of them have active users who are making use of this system now. So I'd say that we're seeing early traction in the enterprise level inference and type workloads beginning to occur in our data center environment. But that is something that we'll see extrapolate and grow over the medium to longer term. Yes. 10 weeks in. So this is certainly one of the areas that I've done a little bit of a double click on here. And I can certainly see that there are absolutely some shifting dynamics in the business. And Keith highlighted this increasing power density in the cabs that are churning in versus, as you pointed, those that are churning out. And for us, perhaps, this is something where we would look to see the billable cabs as a measure, maybe not being as tightly tied to revenue growth as we've seen it in the past. And that's something that I think we're reflecting on. If I think about our xScale business, kilowatts probably is a cleaner metric. But when I think about it from retail, our MRR per cab and our billable cabs that, perhaps, is the right P times Q math that we have now, even though growth is probably more weighted towards the cabin yield versus the cabin count at this point. And I think that we can continue to supplement that with quarterly insights into how we're seeing the density evolve as our business evolves and as the capabilities within our data centers continue to evolve. So it's certainly something that's a whole process for us here. I think as Keith mentioned, just to reiterate, I think those very strong gross bookings plus the leading indicator of cabinets sold, not yet installed are indicators that we will improve on this number in the second half. Yes. I'll comment on this, and then perhaps, Keith, feel free to add. I mean, certainly, we're seeing that our churn in the range of 2% to 2.5%, which is the range that we guided to is something that we can continue to manage to. I think that if we normalized for StackPath in this quarter, we'd have been slightly better than our expectations in terms of where we landed. We also have a supply and demand situation in the market, which has a very positive trajectory on pricing. So maybe this gives us the opportunity to be thoughtful about managing our overall churn dynamic so that we could selectively use proactive churn to help us drive and improve some yields here. I see that some of the challenges that we had in the first half will still exist at the macro level. There's certainly there's need for customers across all industry segments to do more with less. Optimization is still something that customers are looking to do because it does give them that outcome on the more with less tangent. And we definitely have a number of our customers who are in a tougher environment in terms of the industry that they're operating in and the dynamics of that industry. That being said, we see that we will be managing within our full year as per the guide to the ranges that we set. And then I guess, just from a thought process incoming to this, in the world of cloud, this is quite a usual process. I think that there is an opportunity for us to look at some -- to some enhancements in terms of management and proactive management early on of our customer engaged with us as it relates to their use profile and intention to churn. And so I think there is a potential for us to lean in and support our customers as they optimize and to engage in churn-type discussions much earlier in the process than we've been doing thus far. You want to take that first, Keith? Yes, I'll take first or you go first. And perhaps, just building on that and to address the first part of the question around the opportunity in our installed base and new market opportunities. This is something that I feel very, very positive about. Not only have we undertaken or already commenced a very deep refresh of our segmentation of our customer base. But in the context of that, we have looked at each of those elements and how we can create sales place scenarios that allow us to have almost like a rinse-and-repeat model from a selling perspective into a cohort of customers. So very excited about the upsell opportunity as a result of some of those programs in our installed base, but also about the outcomes of the segmentation exercise and the way that we will define our coverage model to enable us to reach further to prospects and bring them into the Equinix family as customers. So a piece of work that's underway, and I'm very confident about the prognosis and outcome of that work."

In the interest of wrapping this call up in 1 hour, we'd like to ask these analysts to limit any follow-on questions to one.   At this time, I'll turn the call over to Charles. \nCharles Meyers: Thank you, Chip. Good afternoon and welcome to our Q1 earnings call.   We had a great start to 2024 driven by our highest Q1 bookings performance on record, strong conversion rates, completely favorable pricing dynamics, and lower-than-expected churn, all resulting in our 85th key quarter of top-line revenue growth, the longest such streak of any S&P 500 company. We closed more than 3,800 deals across more than 3,100 customers for the quarter demonstrating both the scale and the consistency of our go-to-market machine. And we again saw accelerating hyperscale demand translate into robust xScale leasing in both EMEA and Asia. While we continue to operate in an environment of broader economic uncertainty, and see some level of corresponding customer caution, our forward-looking pipeline is strong, and we remain optimistic about the opportunity ahead.   Digital transformation, particularly given the rapid adoption of AI, serves as a powerful catalyst for economic expansion, and our customers remain steadfastly committed to their digital initiatives, recognizing the pivotal role they play in fostering long-term revenue growth and driving operational efficiency.   As we continue to make digital infrastructure more powerful, more accessible and more sustainable, we're thrilled that Merrie Williamson has joined our team as chief customer and revenue officer. Merrie is an operational and visionary leader with unique skills and experience to help drive the next chapter of our growth and brings a proven track record of building new routes to market, enhancing the customer experience, and accelerating go-to-market productivity.   On the sustainability front, we continue to advance our bold future first agenda, with Gartner estimating that by 2027, 80% of CIOs will have performance metrics tied to the sustainability of their IT organization. It's clear to us that companies are prioritizing sustainability in their digital infrastructure decisions. We recently published our ninth Annual ISR Report and continued our industry leadership with 96% renewable energy coverage across our growing portfolio, marking our sixth consecutive year with over 90% coverage. Equinix PPAs now support more than one gigawatt of new clean energy in high-impact markets, and we continue to seek additional clean energy projects that will support our growth.   In late April, we were pleased to announce our first renewable PPA in Singapore, an important part of our plan to continue to grow in this strategically critical market. This project will provide 75 megawatts of solar and is in line with Singapore's Green Plan 2030, which seeks to have all business sectors supported by cleaner energy sources.   In parallel, we remain highly focused on improving the energy efficiency of our existing facilities as measured by power usage effectiveness. In 2023, we invested $78 million in high-returning efficiency projects, improving our average annual PP&E by over 8% year over year to 1.42, another lever in continuing to drive performance in our stabilized assets. We also continue to make progress on adjusting the thermostat in our facilities, with more than 50 of our data centers now operationally ready to enable A1A and strong industry support for the implementation of this important new temperature standard.   Turning to our results as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q1 were $2.1 billion, up 7% over the same quarter last year driven by strong recurring revenues and xScale fees. Adjusted EBITDA was up 6% year-over-year and AFFO per share was meaningfully better than expectations due to strong operating performance. Interconnection revenues stepped up 9% year over year. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant-currency basis. Our unmatched scale and reach continue to drive performance in our data center services portfolio. Given strong underlying demand for digital infrastructure and the long duration in delivering new capacity, we see a growing scarcity mindset, and therefore we continue to invest broadly across our global footprint. We currently have 50 major projects underway in 34 markets across 21 countries, including 14 xScale builds, representing more than 16,000 cabinets of retail and more than 50 megawatts of xScale capacity through the end of 2024. This quarter we added new projects in Frankfurt, Madrid, Osaka, and Silicon Valley. Key multi-market wins this quarter include ServiceNow, expanding with Equinix in multiple locations globally, powering their continued growth including new GenAI workloads, and Wasabi technologies, a cloud object storage service provider expanding across all three regions to support their continued growth.   Our MRR per cabinet continues to rise increasing $119 year over year on a normalized and constant-currency basis to $2,258 driven by continued mark-to-market momentum, solid attach rates for interconnection and digital services, and increasing power densities.  With respect to our net cabinets building capacity constraints in certain key markets and the meaningful delta in power density between churned cabs and booked cabs continues to pressure this metric. But gross additions remain strong and our booked kilowatts in the retail business were at near-record levels. Given strong bookings and upcoming capacity additions, we expect billable cabs to increase in the second half and continue to see cabinet growth as part of the long-term growth story for the business.   Turning to our industry-leading global interconnection franchise, we now have more than 468,000 total interconnections deployed on our platform. In Q1, interconnection adds picked up to 6,200 supported by healthy gross adds and a moderation of consolidations into higher bandwidth connections, and we continue to see a healthy pricing dynamic with a roughly 16% spread in the quarter between churned interconnects and new additions. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 5% quarter over quarter and 24% year over year to nearly 38 terabits per second led by the Americas.   We remain confident that Equinix's unique and durable advantages will continue to position our platform as the logical point of nexus for buyers and sellers of digital services to come together to fuel digital transformation and unlock the enormous potential of AI. This year, Gartner projects the spending on public cloud services will grow 20% to reach $679 billion as business needs and emerging technologies, including GenAI, drive cloud model innovation. We're seeing this translate into strong demand across multiple vectors with key cloud and IT customers broadly and with the hyperscalers specifically. In the quarter, we added one new native cloud on-ramp in Madrid, bringing us to 220 native cloud on-ramps across our portfolio, spanning 47 metros. This represents a nearly 40% market share of private cloud on-ramps in the markets where we operate.  We remain an integral and growing part of hyperscaler architectures, with these customers collectively representing more than $1.3 billion of annualized revenue in Q1 in our retail business alone, with deployments across an average of more than 60 of our data centers around the world. Importantly, we're also seeing strong go-to-market momentum with these market-shaping players as we partner to meet end-customer needs for hybrid cloud and private AI, making the hyperscalers some of our most productive channel partners.   In our xScale program, demand remains robust as cloud and AI needs are translating into strong pre-leasing activity. Since our last earnings call, we've pre-leased an incremental 48 megawatts capacity across our Frankfurt 10, Osaka 4, and Osaka 5 assets, including approximately 34 megawatts leased in mid-April. This brings total xScale leasing to nearly 350 megawatts globally with nearly 90% of our operational and underconstruction capacity leased, and a meaningful pipeline of opportunities to drive continued xScale momentum in the quarters to come.   Additionally, in mid-April, we announced our first U.S. xScale joint venture with PGIM Real Estate for our SV12x asset. When combined with our existing joint ventures in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America, this new JV will bring the expected global xScale portfolio to more than $8 billion in investment across more than 35 facilities and greater than 725 megawatts of power capacity when fully built out. We're also making good progress on additional planned xScale opportunities in the U.S, and we look forward to updating you on those developments in the coming quarters.   Shifting to our digital services portfolio, Equinix Fabric and Network Edge continue to overindex relative to the broader business. We see solid interest from customers looking to use the combination of Fabric, Network Edge and Metal for their digital infrastructure requirements. In support of this need, our engineering teams recently completed the integration of Metal and Fabric, significantly improving the VC creation experience for Metal users. Wins across the business included global security leader CrowdStrike, exploring a cloud-adjacent storage solution on platform Equinix in EMEA to leverage proximity to Equinix's rich ecosystem of cloud and storage provider customers. And an online AI and data analytics education company building out AI infrastructure to support learning for global practitioners.   Our channel program delivered another solid quarter with channel and partner influence deals accounting for over 30% of gross bookings and over 60% of new logos. We continue to see growth from the hyperscalers and from other key partners like AT&T, Avant, Dell, Kyndryl, and Zenlayer with wins across a wide range of industry segments and a broad mix of Equinix services. As we expand into new markets, our partners are accelerating our efforts to sell the global platform.   In Q1, we had a number of wins with Zenlayer in Malaysia, including delivering co-locations and interconnection solutions to a fintech firm, extending its reach into Kuala Lumpur, as well as supporting logistics consulting firm extending into Johor. We also saw a win with Kyndryl who also selected Platform Equinix to service some of its largest customers in Canada, including from the public sector.   So, let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results for the quarter. \nKeith Taylor: Great. Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone.   As highlighted by Charles, we had a strong start to the year, delivering better-than-planned results across each of our core financial metrics. Our net bookings were meaningfully better than expected. We had strong customer momentum, lower-than-expected churn, and continued positive pricing actions, and our forward-looking pipeline remains deep as we look to execute against our plan for the remainder of the year.   Global MRR per cabinet, our ARPU metric measured in U.S. dollars, continues to show momentum across all three regions. With each of our regions now eclipsing to $2,000 for the first time despite the weaker foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar.  Also, our xScale business continues to perform very well having leased another five assets year to date with a meaningful pipeline of opportunities for the quarters to come.   Now, as many of you know, Equinix's competitive advantage in the marketplace is derived from both our interconnected digital ecosystems and our industry-leading global scale and reach. But also, Equinix's operational reliability and putting the customer at the center of everything we do is a third competitive advantage.  As an example, our global ops teams strive to deliver greater than six-ninths of annual availability to our customers, which means being up and running for all, but approximately 30 seconds a year on average. To achieve this outcome, our ops team performed thorough capacity reviews and regularly monitored both our average and peak customer power draw against the shared facility capacity to ensure we can support our commitments to our customers. As demonstrated throughout our greater than 25-year history, we've reliably delivered against these operational commitments, which is why nearly 90% of our new reported bookings activity has historically come from existing customers, and by reliably delivering on our commitments to our customers, our team has also been able to deliver sustained value accretion to you, our shareholders.  As an additional update, we're also pleased to share that the audit committee of the company's board of directors conducted and has substantially completed a previously announced independent investigation with the assistance of independent third-party professional advisors. Based on the findings of the independent investigation, the audit committee has concluded that Equinix's financial reporting has been accurate and the application of its accounting practices has resulted in an appropriate representation of its operating performance. The audit committee had full discretion over the scope of the investigation and was not restricted in any way. As part of this assessment, the audit committee did not identify any accounting inconsistencies or errors requiring an adjustment to or restatement of previously issued financial statements or non-GAAP measures.  Also, as previously disclosed, shortly after the release of the short seller report, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office from the Northern District of California. Additionally, on April 30th, 2024, we received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are cooperating fully with both subpoenas and do not expect to comment further on such matters until appropriate to do so.  Now, let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant-currency basis.   As depicted on Slide 4, global revenues were $2.127 billion, up 7% over the same quarter last year in the upper half of our guidance range on a constant-currency basis. As expected, non-recurring revenue stepped down sequentially yet still remained elevated as a percentage of revenue due to the level of xScale leasing activity in the quarter.  For Q2, given our strong Q1 net bookings activity and increased non-recurring revenues related to our APAC xScale business in April, Q2 revenues are expected to step up 2% to 3% over the prior quarter.   Q1 revenues, net of our FX hedges included a $14 million headwinds when compared to our prior FX guidance rates due to the strong U.S. dollar in the quarter. Global Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $992 million or 47% of revenues, up 6% over the same quarter last year and above the top end of our guidance range due to lower utilities expense and timing of spend. Q1 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, included $6 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and $1 million of integration costs. Global Q1 AFFO was $843 million, up 8% over the same quarter last year and above our expectations due to strong operating performance and lower-than-expected net interest expense. As planned, we had seasonally lower recurring capex spend, consistent with prior years. Q1 AFFO included a $4 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q1 MRR was better than expected at 2.1%. For the full year, we continue to expect MRR churn to average in the 2% to 2.5% quarterly guidance range.   Turning to our regional highlights, these full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized basis, APAC was our fastest-growing region at 12% followed by the Americas and EMEA regions both growing at 6%.  The Americas region had a great quarter with strong bookings performance led by the public sector activity and healthy pickup in exports to the other regions as our team sold across our global platform. We saw particular strength in our Atlanta, Culpeper, and Miami metros, as well as a strong interest in the additional soon-to-be open capacity in the New York Metro.   Our EMEA business delivered a strong quarter with robust gross bookings activity including an increased mix of medium and larger footprint deals. In the quarter, we saw booking strength in our Barcelona, Frankfurt and Paris markets.  And finally, Asia Pacific region had a great quarter with firm pricing and strength from our digital services products, including increased adoption of inter metro connections on Equinix Fabric as customers continue to focus on their network optimization efforts. In the quarter, we saw Good Inc. recently opened capacity in Malaysia and continued momentum in our largest markets in the region including Hong Kong, Tokyo and Sydney.   And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our net leverage remained low relative to our peers at 3.6 times our annualized adjusted EBITDA. Our balance sheet decreased approximately $31.9 billion, including unrestricted cash balance of over $1.5 billion. Our cash balance decreased quarter-over-quarter as our strong operating cash flow was more than offset by the growth investments and the quarterly cash dividend. As noted previously, and given our strong balance sheet and liquidity position, we plan to remain opportunistic as it relates to the timing, size and currency of our future capital market activities, including when we plan to refinance the $1 billion of debt maturing later this year.  Turning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $707 million including seasonally lowered recurring capex of $21 million. Since our last earnings call, we opened three retail projects in Mexico City, Mumbai and Paris. We also purchased our Dublin 2, Mumbai 2 and Stockholm 3 assets, as well as land for development in Santiago, Chile. Revenues from owned assets increased at 67% of our recurring revenues, and more than 90% of the current retail expansion investment will be on owned land or owned buildings with long-term ground leases.  Now, we're also entering a stage in our asset lifecycle where we're evaluating select opportunities to invest in highly valued IBXs that have been operating for 20 years or longer. Starting this quarter, we added a new category of non-recurring capex spend to our disclosures, referred to as redevelopment capex, to track these investments to enhance the capacity, efficiency and operating standards of facilities in this category, and to attract capital investments that are intended to meaningfully extend the economic life of assets. Our first redevelopment project is DC2, one of our original IBXs that opened in the early 2000s, and home to our networking ecosystem in northern Virginia. Total estimated spend on this DC2 project will approximate $76 million broken into two primary categories of capex investment, redevelopment and recurring. We expect the $56 million redevelopment portion of the investment to yield meaningful additional space and power capacity, and, given the favorable pricing environment and high customer demand for the DC2 asset, we anticipate that this capacity will generate additional revenues and cash flow that should result in an IR well above our current stabilized asset yields. The remaining portion of the investment, which relates to maintaining our existing revenues, such as roof replacement, will be categorized as typical as recurring capex.   Now moving to Slide 10. Our capital investments have continued to deliver strong returns. Consistent with prior years in Q1, we completed the annual refresh of our IBX categorization exercise, and our stabilized asset count increased by a net six IBXs. Our now 180-stabilized asset increased recurring revenues by 5% year over year on a constant-currency basis, a quarter-over-quarter step-down as we lap the power price actions in 2023. Stabilized assets were collectively 84% utilized and generated a 26% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested.  And finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for updated summary of 2024 guidance and bridges. Do note all growth rates are on a normalized and constant-currency basis. For the full year 2024, we're maintaining our underlying revenue outlook with expected top-line growth of 7% to 8%, a reflection of our continued strong momentum. We're raising our underlying 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $5 million due to lower integration spend. We're raising our underlying 2024 AFFO guidance by $25 million to now grow between 10% and 13% compared to the previous year due to lower net interest expense. AFFO per share is now expected to grow between 8% and 11%. 2024 capex is expected to range between $2.8 billion and $3 billion including about $220 million of recurring capex spend.   So, let me stop here, and I'll turn the call back to Charles. \nCharles Meyers: Thanks, Keith.   In closing, we continue to see our customers derive compelling value from platform Equinix, leveraging our superior global reach, our scaled digital ecosystem, our market-leading interconnection platform and our greater-than-25-year track record of delivering on our commitments to fuel their investments in digital transformation. We are delighted to see the continued strength and fundamentals of our business, we remain highly confident in the integrity of our financials and we are as optimistic as ever that we'll continue to be an important partner for digital leaders as they accelerate AI investments and embrace hybrid and multi-cloud as the clear architecture of choice.  Before we turn to Q&A, I want to spend a few minutes on my transition. In reflecting on the last six years, it has been both a pleasure and a privilege to be the CEO of Equinix, showing up every day in service to our customers, to our employees, and to our shareholders. As I transition to the role of Executive Chairman later this quarter, I'll continue to take an active part in the business as Adaire Fox-Martin steps into the CEO role. Adaire is an extremely accomplished executive with a proven ability to deliver sustained value to the full range of stakeholders. I'm confident that she brings the experience, the skills, and the passion that we need to inspire our teams and support the evolving needs of our customers, driving growth and unlocking the extraordinary power of Platform Equinix. I look forward to working with Adaire in this next chapter of the Equinix journey.   I'd also like to thank Peter Van Camp, a shining example of the magic of Equinix over the last 25 years, and look forward to partnering with him as he moves from our Executive Chairman to Special Advisor to the board.   I look forward to further collaboration with both Adaire and the broader leadership team as we continue on our path as the world's digital infrastructure company capturing and creating new opportunities and leveraging our distinctive advantages to ensure digital leaders can harness our trusted platform to create and interconnect the foundational digital infrastructure that enhances our world.  So, let me stop there and open it up for questions. \nOperator: Thank you.   [Operator instructions]   Our first question will come from Jon Atkin of RBC. \nJonathan Atkin: XScale, just interested in what you're seeing in terms of targeted unlevered returns that you're underwriting. Any difference given the strong demand profile?   And then, it looks like you've got $1 billion of senior notes coming due late this year, $1.2 billion due in 2025, and I just wondered what you're thinking in terms of refinancing cost of debt and whether a non-U.S. jurisdiction might provide a cost advantage. \nCharles Meyers: Yeah, Jon. I'll take the first piece and then Keith can both add to that and then take the second piece on the refinancing.   Look, xScale, you're right, continues to perform extremely well. We've seen huge pre-leasing activity over the last several quarters and I think we continue to see a lot of demand out there and a lot of confidence that we'll be able to effectively pre-sell that capacity as well and under returns that I think are in line with -- I mean, I do think we're seeing relatively firm pricing. I also think we're seeing rising costs, and so I think that the combination of those things leaves us with, I think, a level of underwriting that is at or above kind of where we probably were last year and feeling very confident in the range where we are on cash and cash returns overall. \nKeith Taylor: And Jon, maybe I just want to add on to what Charles said there. I think it's important to appreciate that there's a fee stream that Equinix continues to enjoy on a larger revenue base to compensate for the higher costs that Charles alluded to. So, when I think about our all-in returns, they're really quite attractive as a business, and as we've talked about over the last few years, they're at a point where also that it's not only the recurring and nonrecurring stream that we get, I think there's opportunity over some period of time as our partners think about mentioning monetizing some of their investments to promote fees associated with it.  So, overall, again, I think the return profile, as Charles alluded to, is attractive, recognizing it's a higher cost model than it was previously, and you'll see that in our results. As it relates to really the debt that's being refinanced, I'm going to maybe approach it from a different perspective, because when you think about the cost, I really want to talk about the spread. Partially, the spread is really about what do we think we can borrow over whatever the base rate is. And as I made reference to it -- and I'm going to pause here for a second, Jon. Can you hear me? \nJonathan Atkin: Absolutely, yes. \nKeith Taylor: OK. Thank you. We had a funny -- something going on with our conference line here.   So, I think about it more spread, and again, I made the reference in the prepared remarks that we're going to look at the timing and the currency in which we borrow money. Suffice it to say between how we raise our capital and where we need it to refinance the existing debt, we're really looking at different markets. And so, the spread, I think, you should expect, based on where we were, I think somewhere between 105 and 115 basis points over base, whatever that is. Now, we might do it in euro, we might do it in dollar, and we could swap it depending on where the cash flows are needed, but suffice it to say, I think we're in a really good spot to enjoy a spread relative to others that is very competitive.   The last comment I would just say is, look, the markets are very volatile right now, but for obvious reasons, you see that. And that's why I think it's important to talk about the spread. Suffice it to say, I think we will have ample access to capital. It just depends on the timing of when we execute against that transaction. So, whether it's this year or it's next year refinancing, I think we're in a really good spot. And then I think as everybody is also aware, we have effectively an unused line of credit of $4 billion. So, if the markets aren't there for whatever reason, we can always draw on that and then refinance at a later date, but I don't foresee that as being an issue for us. \nCharles Meyers: Jon, I would back up a little bit to the xScale and just say in addition to the underwriting continuing to be strong, pre-leasing activity strong, I think we're seeing exactly it play out very much as we expected in terms of how the whole thing fits together from a platform strategy standpoint. So very pleased with the xScale business and very pleased with how it fits in overall in terms of driving the broader value of the platform to our customers. \nJonathan Atkin: Just given the demand profile and the pricing dynamic that we've heard elsewhere, would low teens be an unreasonable kind of assumption to think about for unlevered return development yields or not? \nKeith Taylor: I think it's reasonable. Of course, certain markets have different price points as you can appreciate. But one of the things I think, at a broad range, I think low teens is very, very appropriate on an unlevered basis. And I don't think we can -- you can't lose sight, generally speaking, of the supply and sort of the demand sort of dynamics here, that supply is going to continue to be -- it's going to be difficult to deliver into the marketplace, and so, when you look at the demand profile, I think pricing will continue to remain very, very firm. So, on an unlevered basis, we can get a really nice return and you add on the fee structure that we can enjoy as a business. And we recently announced the Silicon Valley 12 transaction. Again, we're very pleased with the overall structure and type of deal we're doing there, and we're working really hard to bring that to a fully stabilized position and you know what, the returns that you're considering. \nCharles Meyers: Thanks, Jon. \nOperator: The next question comes from Nick Del Deo of MoffettNathanson. \nNicholas Del Deo: Charles, best of luck in the new role. I appreciate all the time you spent with us on these calls and other forums over the years.  First, can you share any details regarding the mechanics of the internal review, like who is engaged to perform the work or the aspects of the accounting that was reviewed and how far back they went? Any suggestions for go-forward changes? Then anything along those lines would be super helpful. \nCharles Meyers: Sure. I'll give you a bit of that, and Keith can certainly add to it.   The mechanics that we did, the audit committee obviously was the one conducting that, and we have a very experienced audit committee acting independently. And then they retained independent advisors in WilmerHale, the law firm that led the investigation, as well as AlixPartners, the forensic accountants, independent forensic accountants that led that. And they looked at, particularly surrounding, obviously, the accounting-related matters that were sort of referenced in the allegations in the short report. And as a public company, as frustrating as it might be, that's our obligation to undertake an investigation to look into those. And so, we tried to keep people focused on the business, while that investigation took place and we tried to focus on serving our customers while the audit committee led that investigation alongside the advisors. They collected the right information that they deemed as appropriate to validate and understand the concerns that were there and making a judgment and an assessment about the accuracy of our financial reporting, both on a GAAP basis and the non-GAAP measures that were involved here. And again, as we said in the press release and in the prepared remarks here, they came back with a level of confidence in those results and in the accuracy of those results. And so, while the investigation remains open, in large part, because we have to sort of navigate the subpoenas with the SEC and the DOJ, we feel great about the outcome. I feel like it really speaks to the integrity of our team, which, as I said, I have great confidence in and in the integrity of our financials. So, I'll leave it there, and if there's anything you want to add there Keith? \nKeith Taylor: No, I think, well said, Charles. Thanks. \nNicholas Del Deo: OK. Again, great to hear. Thanks for sharing those details. I guess one other topic, Keith, you noted that DC2 is going through a redevelopment, obviously, a crown jewel facility for you guys. I guess you noted the attractive IRRs associated with the investments. I guess can you expand a little bit on the work that you're doing to that data center and what you think those capex dollars might unlock from a revenue perspective? \nKeith Taylor: Yeah, sure. It's one of those ones -- we've been working on this initiative for roughly a year, because it is a new category of expansion capex. And certainly, what you're trying to do is do two things.   One, we want to extend effectively the life of the asset further than people would typically anticipate. We're really going in and doing is really a heart transplant in a live environment. It's one of our highest-performing assets in the portfolio. And so, to give you a perspective, it's substantial because we refer to the $76 million, so you get a sense it's not something that's small. It's going to do two things. It's going to extend the life. It's going to create more revenue opportunities. And think of the range of 15% to 20% of an augmentation to an already high revenue environment. So that's the kind of value you can extract from it. The $20 million, the recurring capex component, will be doing roof replacement and some other things, and so that will go through the recurring line. But it's the $56 million -- in the prepared remarks, we really talked about the fact that this is going to get a yield, a return for us on an IRR basis better than stabilized assets. So, it gives you a sense it's in the 30s. If you decide to put sort of the end-of-life stuff that was recurring into the mix, you're still in the 20s. So, it gives you a sense of the investment decision that we're making is very, very substantial in a very critical asset.   The last thing I also want to leave you with, when we make this type of decision, part of the reason we were really calling it a redevelopment is this isn't like getting something done over a quarter. Again, high-density live environment is going to take two to three years to get this done. So, it gives you a sense of the level of investment. It's not like replacing a motor. We're basically taking out the guts of the entire IBX and replacing it with basic new and updated equipment. So, overall, I'd just say it's one of those things. There's not a huge portfolio, but I think over the next three to five years or something like that, you should expect something like six to eight assets could fall into that mix. Again, it has to be older than 20 years, and we have to invest more than $20 million for it to be considered a redevelopment capex item. \nCharles Meyers: Yeah, I'll just add a little more color, Nick, in that. So, I think that the type of capex investment, as you said, is in the base infrastructure required to operate the data center, power, cooling, etc. But the big difference here is that -- and we're seeing this dynamic play out because of the sort of rising density needs across the business, where we are, at times, needing to derate space and actually have space come off of the sort of -- go on to what we refer to as engineering hold. And in situations where you can unlock additional usable power, either through power efficiency projects or this kind of redevelopment investment, where you're putting entirely new equipment in, if you can unlock that power and match it to the space that is unused or on hold, you get meaningful, incremental capacity. And that's really the big difference here, is you're getting incremental capacity that starts to feel like another phase of a project. And so, in this case, DC2 is coming out of the stabilized assets, which, by the way, hurts stabilized asset pool, goes back into expansion. And the reason is because it's a really meaningful uptick in the overall capacity available from that facility. And that's really the litmus test that we use to say, OK, is it appropriate to qualify as a redevelopment project? And in this case, very, very much so given the customer demand for that asset. \nOperator: The next question comes from Aryeh Klein of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. \nAryeh Klein: Congrats, Charles, on the transition. I guess going back to xScale, I think about 40% of all the leasing done by xScale since launch has been since the beginning of the fourth quarter. How does the pipeline look relative to the amount of leasing that's been done recently?  And then when fully built out, you noted having about 725 megawatts of capacity. So, you're essentially almost halfway there with what's leased. Are you looking to add more to that? Are you rethinking just how big the platform can be and the investments you want to make in it? \nCharles Meyers: The short answer is absolutely. We're going to continue to grow the overall platform on the xScale side and retail side, but I think clearly there is a ton of demand out there, and we think we have a very, very credible story. And I think, as you said, the leasing momentum that we have generated over the last several quarters is quite indicative of that. And so, yeah, what we have left, we feel confident we're going to be able to lease effectively and as I said in the script, we're also excited to give you updates on what we have talked about pretty openly, and we've announced the SV12x asset, the first xScale in the Americas, but we also are deeply engaged in a set of conversations around how we're going to expand our xScale platform in the U.S. and the Americas more broadly. And so, we don't have anything specific to share with you, but we will in the not-too-distant future, and we look forward to that conversation. In terms of -- now we're not yet prepared to sort of size that precisely, but I will say that when you look back at what we said when we first talked about xScale at the Analyst Day, I don't know when that was, '18 or something, and what we said was what we thought it was going to be. It's certainly proven to be a lot more than that. And I think it continues to be a super exciting opportunity. Very proud of the team that continues to run that business for us, and they're doing great things and we're excited about the value that deliver for our customers. \nAryeh Klein: OK, thanks. And then just separately, you noted some of the reasons that cabinet adds were soft in the quarter, and you talked about seeing better growth in the second half of the year. Can you just talk about what underpins that? And is that coming from backlog? Or is there an assumption in there around some of the longer sales cycle times moderating? \nCharles Meyers: Yeah. I mean, the billable cabs, it comes from a few different things. You're right. We've always talked about the volatility in billable cabs based partially on timing of installs. It's not so much a longer sales cycle. Sometimes, it is a bit of a longer install cycle, and so, depending on the timing of installs and in fact the timing of churn, you can see volatility in any quarter. That's why we've always sort of told people over the years to look at a rolling four-quarter metric, but even that has really been under pressure, and has been under pressure primarily because of power density, and I think that kind of makes sense to people, but we're realizing, I think, that we really need to give people a bit more to hang their hat on relative to that particular metric. So, let me give you some of the math, I think, that will help people understand the billable cabs metric and how it plays here and what's causing the bit of pressure on that. We guide the 2% to 2.5% churn rate on our recurring revenue each quarter. So, we're running today at an MRR run rate of about $667 million. So, if you take 2% of that figure, at the low end of the range, so you're at $13 million to $14 million in MRR churn in any given quarter. As we said, our MRR per cab is averaging right now at 2,258. So, if you take that and divide those two together, you'd be churning roundabout 6,000 cabs in any given quarter. And more than that, if we're churning cabs that are at a lower-than-average MRR per cab, which candidly we would hope to be doing, if you're going to churn some cabs, it should be ones that are below the average, right? And so, in Q1, we were churning cabs that were at an average of 4.4 kilowatts. We were adding back cabs at an average of 5.8 kilowatts. And so, when you do that math, all in, in terms of that relatively large gap in density, you're looking at about a 1,500-cab hole that you've got to fill. So actually, staying flat on cabs is really a pretty significant win.   The density increase that's causing that sort of hole in the bucket on cab count though is a really important factor in driving the MRR per cab. So, if you go and if you look at our year-over-year growth on billable cabs, Q1 to Q1, last year to this year, it's softer for sure. It's only up about 1%. But over that same time frame, our MRR per cab is up 6% across the estate, and so, you add those two together and the composite gives you that 7% growth. So, long way of saying that, in other words that stable to slightly growing cab count is certainly a different dynamic than what we have seen. But the growth is coming. It's just coming in a slightly different shape. And so, we're still driving the growth in the business and getting the economic returns that we were anticipating. So, I think that, for us, rather than looking for a new indicator, I think, what we're going to look to do is moderate expectations on the cab growth and say, look, we're having to cover that whole quarter-over-quarter from a density standpoint, but it's really driving the MRR per cab, and it's the composite of those two things that really give you the solid growth model going forward. \nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. \nDavid Barden: So, Keith, just the first question would be, based on what Charles was just saying and the explanations that he's been having to make about this interpretation of MRR per cabinet and power density and cabinet numbers, where are we on the creation of these new metrics that I think we've been talking about for six months?   And the second question, if I could, would be, it's great that the audit committee hired these independent advisors and it exonerated itself and the company and all the words that were used. But how much daylight is there between what you looked at and what the SEC and the DOJ are looking at and your comfort factor that we've buttoned this thing up, and in what time frame can we expect a resolution to that? \nCharles Meyers: Yeah, I'm trying to decide which order to take them in. We feel like we've got the metrics that we need and I think there's a lot of complexity to introducing new metrics to the -- and so I think that the MRR per cab, even though it's probably going to have a slightly different growth profile than it has, combined with the MRR per cab are really the billable cab count and the MRR per cab. And the product of those two is really the metric that we continue to come back to. And so, I think that rather than introduce a new metric, we're going to really stick to those two and try to give you better visibility to what you should expect along the product of those two, which it really drives the growth.  As it relates to the investigation, I would say that I think we can't comment in detail on the specifics of the DOJ and the SEC subpoenas, but I would say that the investigation work conducted by the audit committee and by the independent advisors who I just talked about over the several weeks seems like an eternity, but it's been the last several weeks and a lot of amazing work done really represents, I think, the foundation of what we believe is needed to address the matters in the DOJ and SEC subpoenas. And it's not unusual for I think, the sort of discussions with those parties, DOJ and SEC to lag and take a bit longer. But I feel like we've got our arms around that solidly, and we'll provide an update on that in whatever time frame that requires. Unfortunately, I think that's very hard for us to provide any specificity around.  Keith, do you want to add that? \nKeith Taylor: Just add one, as Charles said, and I think it's important to understand that the level of work that was done since March 20th, so five, six weeks of work, was also included what was anticipated to be needed by the DOJ and the SEC. So, a tremendous amount of work has been done, and it's surrounded by what I would call the matters that relate to accounting irregularities. And I would expect, and I know this to be true, that they're already in dialogue with the parties. They're appropriately within dialogue with the parties. And again, this is going to be done independently as you would expect. Of course, they're going to draw on the resources of the company where needed to answer to questions and queries. So, I just think it takes a little bit of time, but getting to where we are that we filed the 10-Q yesterday should give you tremendous comfort on where we concluded. And, again, there is no adjustments, no findings. And so, as a result, I feel really good about where we are. And as Charles has said in his remarks, that related to both GAAP and non-GAAP, and I think that was really important. So, again, it will take probably a little bit of time, but overall, again, I feel very comfortable that by the filing of our 10-Q, it's a pretty good strong indication of where we are in the journey. \nCharles Meyers: Yeah, I think the shorter answer to your question probably would have been not a lot of light between those I think, and I think we feel confident that we're going to be able to navigate those. Again, how timely I'm not sure, because I think those are probably not things that are frequently rapid, just due to the parties you're dealing with. We'll navigate them on as rapid a time frame as we can, or the audit committee and the independent investigators will, and then we'll report that back to you as we know more. \nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. \nMichael Rollins: Charles, I want to wish you the best on the transition as well. Wanted to ask a question about some of the comments from earlier. You commented that 1Q was better, I think, on the net bookings, your budget and you had lower churn, and you maintained the outlook for constant-currency revenue growth ex PPI of 7% to 8%. And so, I'm curious, has your view evolved on how you expect the second half in terms of organic year-over-year growth to ramp relative to the first half of the year? And are there other considerations that kept the organic constant-currency revenue guidance unchanged? And then I'll have a second one if I could as well. \nCharles Meyers: Sure. Yeah. Thanks for the well wishes, Mike, and thanks for the questions.   I would say that the second half guide or the second half, I think, outlook for us doesn't look dramatically different. I think we had said that we're clearly looking at some acceleration in the back half of the year from a bookings perspective. And again, we feel good about the pipeline. We had a strong Q1, and so we probably had a slightly better Q1, and that gives us a little running start at that back half of the year. But I also think we are seeing -- although we saw lower churn than we had forecasted or expected in the prior guide, I do think we are continuing to see some level of churn in the system that I think we have to continue to navigate. And so, I think there -- not any big changes in the outlook and that's why again, you saw us maintain that outlook overall. \nKeith Taylor: And Mike, maybe just adding on to that, when you get to the second half of the year, you recognize that that, certainly it matters to the year, but it's not as important because it really matters to the year following. So, that's one of the things that you have to look at. We had a pretty good idea of what we think we could do for the first half of the year, and as Charles just mentioned, we're ahead of where we were. But offsetting some of that, of course, is some other things that have gone on inside the business, an example of metered power. And so, you're absorbing the fact that power costs have been down relative to where we were. We actually had a power price decrease, as you're aware, from the fourth quarter earnings call. And because of that, you're diluting a little bit of the growth. So, it's a combination of power being a little bit lower and sort of diluting it. In the second half of the year, we still anticipate to deliver against the expectations. But I would maybe characterize this as maybe a parting remark that when we look at risks and opportunities, the opportunities both in the revenue line and the cost line are much greater than those in the risk line. And so, where we are today, I just think that we're taking a posture that is appropriate given where we are at this time of year and just all the noise that's in the system. \nCharles Meyers: Yeah. And I mean, Mike, we've used this term on the last few calls as sort of crosscurrents, right, which is a sort of strange combination of a lot of interest in demand around digital transformation broadly speaking, around AI, in particular. I think we're still seeing that. I think we're seeing great interest in AI and in hybrid AI, private AI, sort of mixed with public cloud as a sort of preferred architecture for a lot of the AI workloads that we're looking at. I think we're seeing a lot of customers looking at where they want to place their data. And I think they are increasingly reaching the conclusion that sort of proximate to the cloud is the right answer, and I think we're really well-positioned to benefit from that, and we're seeing some demand there. We're seeing a nice pipeline on the managed DGX opportunity that we have out in the market with NVIDIA. And yet at the same time, we are also seeing, as I characterized in the script, some level of customer caution, some level of tightening and desire for optimization in a still somewhat uncertain macro environment. And so, I think it's all those things together that led us to say, hey, this guide is a good one. We feel like we've got opportunity to outperform against it, particularly, on the FFO line, but that's kind of where we landed and sort of overall balance for the guide. \nMichael Rollins: And just the second thing I want to hit was what you were just touching on, some of the use case examples for AI. So, you gave some examples of how customers can use the Equinix platform. Can you just share in terms of -- whether it was relative to the number of deals that you did in the quarter or relative to the pipeline, what you're kind of seeing in terms of that interest or the realization of that interest so far? And are there any other additional learnings on the AI front that the market should be mindful of for Equinix? \nCharles Meyers: Yeah. I would still characterize it as quite early days because I do think there is a ton of interest in AI, but I think that the actual execution of implementing infrastructure, driving workloads, etc. is I think still relatively early in the cycle. Now, I do think there is a lot of attention on really large-scale training workloads, and I do think we're seeing some of the demand in our xScale business being driven by demand from hyperscalers, which again are the largest customers of our xScale offering. And so, I think that is probably ahead of the game, but I think what we're now seeing is a really rich pipeline of enterprise training opportunities, as well as inference opportunities where inference is more distributed. And we've been saying this all along, I think that's where the unique different creation of Equinix is likely to be because of our highly distributed footprint, and because I think we bring that blend of capabilities to the table not only xScale. And we did see an uptick, I will say this quarter, in larger footprint opportunities, and I think some of that is really associated with AI-related workloads, both service provider and enterprise. And so, we're seeing a little bit of a different mix. I think still relatively early, but I think a lot of room for optimism in the AI opportunity overall for us. \nOperator: The last question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. \nSimon Flannery: Charles, best of luck with everything. I wanted to come back to the cabinets if I could. I think you mentioned, Charles, at one point that you are limited for capacity constraints in certain key markets. If we look at the overall utilization, we're seeing 78%, 79%, and that's down year-over-year. You've added a lot of capacity over the last few quarters here. So, just help us unpack that a little bit because it looks like, at least, on an aggregate level, where are the pressure points here and what's the opportunity to relieve those. \nCharles Meyers: Yeah, great question. I mean, I think there's a few markets around the world that we have recently added capacity or it is around the corner. A great example would be the New York Metro where we are already pre-selling capacity in that, but don't yet have as much available to actually bill into as we would like. And so, I think that's a classic area of constraint. We've also seen, of course, Singapore is a more, I think, more protracted area of constraint in the business. And it's one of the reasons why we talked about our sustainability efforts there, which were quite central in our ability to gain incremental capacity to sort of awards, if you will, from the Singaporean government. And so, I think that one's going to be a little bit of a longer slog for us. And I think, unfortunately, it means that we're going to have to continue to be opportunistic about churn and trying to rerate that and use that to continue to serve the capacity that is most critical there. But those are a couple of key examples. What might be some of the other ones, Keith, you already had some constraints there? \nKeith Taylor: Yeah. Overall, I mean, if you look at some of the Canadian markets, it's not so much a constraint of generation, it's a constraint of distribution, and so Northern Virginia is an example of that, some of the Canadian markets, the Irish market, the Dublin market is another place. And so overall, it's sort of trying to optimize the environment as Charles alluded to, Singapore being that perfect example of deciding how you want to rerate the space and being very disciplined about what we sell, notwithstanding just a general thought about introducing a lot of new capacity into new markets, second tier, third tier markets for us. And they take longer to ramp, while at the same time, you have these major metros around the world where we're in dire need of incremental capacity. And so, that's what we're investing in. And so, it's really trying to optimize as best as we can across the portfolio, recognizing each market has a little bit of uniqueness to it. And so, working alongside what are we churning, where are we churning, and what does the inventory hold or engineering hold on some of the capacity as we augment with efficiency initiatives and the like, it's a combination of all these things that are factoring into our decision. And it goes back to the sort of the net cabinet billing discussion. When you look at the -- when you step back and say, well, that's part of what's causing that utilization level to be where it is, but you really have to step back and understand what is the revenue drivers of the business. You saw in our second quarter guide, we have a meaningful step up in revenues. A good roughly 65% to 70% of that is coming from MRR. And so, you know that we've got more revenue coming into the next quarter. We've got some MRR activity through xScale, but there's momentum in the business, and it doesn't necessarily appear the way that some of us would expect historically because it's not necessarily going to a lot of new incremental cabinets. There's more volume attached to the cabinets that we have. And so, it's a combination of those two things that I think are causing us to, I guess, be a little bit more cautious in what we talked about on a net billing cabinet basis, but we know that the revenue is there to support our growth. \nSimon Flannery: So, we shouldn't be thinking of utilization getting back to the low to mid-80s, be more in this sort of 79, 80 level? \nKeith Taylor: Charles alluded in his prepared remarks, we see the cabinet building number is going to increase and as a result, utilization will certainly continue to increase. I just don't know if it will happen at the rate that we would expect given all the other things that are going on in the business. And the caution that Charles alluded to, we are being cautious in our guide. We left the revenue guide constant, absent currency. We have momentum. We did better than we anticipated in the first quarter. Obviously, we made a reference to the fact the pipeline is exceedingly deep. That's a positive. But we're just not at a point to say, well, what does that mean from a billing cabinet basis? Are we going to alter basically the trajectory of our revenues based on what we've already guided? And there's just a number of factors that we're considering.   But overall, I'd just say there's strong momentum in the business. I think utilization will go up. I think net cabinet spilling will go up. I think based on the power utilization that we're selling, it will cause the density of cabinets to -- or a power sold per cabinet to continue to be elevated. And for all those reasons, that's why we have, I would think, momentum on the revenue line. But we're not yet prepared to change the trajectory of the revenue guide at this point. \nCharles Meyers: But I do think that -- I mean, look, the stabilized assets are 84% utilized overall. I think we've got room in the class that just went in for additional utilization. And so, I think that we absolutely are going to continue to see improving utilization, but we are continuing to add capacity for sure just given the level of demand that's out there. So, I think it'll just depend on how that ebbs and flows into the utilization number. \nChip Newcom: This concludes our Q1 earnings call. Thank you for joining us. \nOperator: Goodbye. Again, that does conclude today's conference, you may disconnect at this time. Thank you and have a good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Keith Taylor",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone.   As highlighted by Charles, we had a strong start to the year, delivering better-than-planned results across each of our core financial metrics. Our net bookings were meaningfully better than expected. We had strong customer momentum, lower-than-expected churn, and continued positive pricing actions, and our forward-looking pipeline remains deep as we look to execute against our plan for the remainder of the year.   Global MRR per cabinet, our ARPU metric measured in U.S. dollars, continues to show momentum across all three regions. With each of our regions now eclipsing to $2,000 for the first time despite the weaker foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar.  Also, our xScale business continues to perform very well having leased another five assets year to date with a meaningful pipeline of opportunities for the quarters to come.   Now, as many of you know, Equinix's competitive advantage in the marketplace is derived from both our interconnected digital ecosystems and our industry-leading global scale and reach. But also, Equinix's operational reliability and putting the customer at the center of everything we do is a third competitive advantage.  As an example, our global ops teams strive to deliver greater than six-ninths of annual availability to our customers, which means being up and running for all, but approximately 30 seconds a year on average. To achieve this outcome, our ops team performed thorough capacity reviews and regularly monitored both our average and peak customer power draw against the shared facility capacity to ensure we can support our commitments to our customers. As demonstrated throughout our greater than 25-year history, we've reliably delivered against these operational commitments, which is why nearly 90% of our new reported bookings activity has historically come from existing customers, and by reliably delivering on our commitments to our customers, our team has also been able to deliver sustained value accretion to you, our shareholders.  As an additional update, we're also pleased to share that the audit committee of the company's board of directors conducted and has substantially completed a previously announced independent investigation with the assistance of independent third-party professional advisors. Based on the findings of the independent investigation, the audit committee has concluded that Equinix's financial reporting has been accurate and the application of its accounting practices has resulted in an appropriate representation of its operating performance. The audit committee had full discretion over the scope of the investigation and was not restricted in any way. As part of this assessment, the audit committee did not identify any accounting inconsistencies or errors requiring an adjustment to or restatement of previously issued financial statements or non-GAAP measures.  Also, as previously disclosed, shortly after the release of the short seller report, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office from the Northern District of California. Additionally, on April 30th, 2024, we received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are cooperating fully with both subpoenas and do not expect to comment further on such matters until appropriate to do so.  Now, let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Note that all growth rates in this section are on a normalized and constant-currency basis.   As depicted on Slide 4, global revenues were $2.127 billion, up 7% over the same quarter last year in the upper half of our guidance range on a constant-currency basis. As expected, non-recurring revenue stepped down sequentially yet still remained elevated as a percentage of revenue due to the level of xScale leasing activity in the quarter.  For Q2, given our strong Q1 net bookings activity and increased non-recurring revenues related to our APAC xScale business in April, Q2 revenues are expected to step up 2% to 3% over the prior quarter.   Q1 revenues, net of our FX hedges included a $14 million headwinds when compared to our prior FX guidance rates due to the strong U.S. dollar in the quarter. Global Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $992 million or 47% of revenues, up 6% over the same quarter last year and above the top end of our guidance range due to lower utilities expense and timing of spend. Q1 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, included $6 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates and $1 million of integration costs. Global Q1 AFFO was $843 million, up 8% over the same quarter last year and above our expectations due to strong operating performance and lower-than-expected net interest expense. As planned, we had seasonally lower recurring capex spend, consistent with prior years. Q1 AFFO included a $4 million FX headwind when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q1 MRR was better than expected at 2.1%. For the full year, we continue to expect MRR churn to average in the 2% to 2.5% quarterly guidance range.   Turning to our regional highlights, these full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized basis, APAC was our fastest-growing region at 12% followed by the Americas and EMEA regions both growing at 6%.  The Americas region had a great quarter with strong bookings performance led by the public sector activity and healthy pickup in exports to the other regions as our team sold across our global platform. We saw particular strength in our Atlanta, Culpeper, and Miami metros, as well as a strong interest in the additional soon-to-be open capacity in the New York Metro.   Our EMEA business delivered a strong quarter with robust gross bookings activity including an increased mix of medium and larger footprint deals. In the quarter, we saw booking strength in our Barcelona, Frankfurt and Paris markets.  And finally, Asia Pacific region had a great quarter with firm pricing and strength from our digital services products, including increased adoption of inter metro connections on Equinix Fabric as customers continue to focus on their network optimization efforts. In the quarter, we saw Good Inc. recently opened capacity in Malaysia and continued momentum in our largest markets in the region including Hong Kong, Tokyo and Sydney.   And now looking at our capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our net leverage remained low relative to our peers at 3.6 times our annualized adjusted EBITDA. Our balance sheet decreased approximately $31.9 billion, including unrestricted cash balance of over $1.5 billion. Our cash balance decreased quarter-over-quarter as our strong operating cash flow was more than offset by the growth investments and the quarterly cash dividend. As noted previously, and given our strong balance sheet and liquidity position, we plan to remain opportunistic as it relates to the timing, size and currency of our future capital market activities, including when we plan to refinance the $1 billion of debt maturing later this year.  Turning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $707 million including seasonally lowered recurring capex of $21 million. Since our last earnings call, we opened three retail projects in Mexico City, Mumbai and Paris. We also purchased our Dublin 2, Mumbai 2 and Stockholm 3 assets, as well as land for development in Santiago, Chile. Revenues from owned assets increased at 67% of our recurring revenues, and more than 90% of the current retail expansion investment will be on owned land or owned buildings with long-term ground leases.  Now, we're also entering a stage in our asset lifecycle where we're evaluating select opportunities to invest in highly valued IBXs that have been operating for 20 years or longer. Starting this quarter, we added a new category of non-recurring capex spend to our disclosures, referred to as redevelopment capex, to track these investments to enhance the capacity, efficiency and operating standards of facilities in this category, and to attract capital investments that are intended to meaningfully extend the economic life of assets. Our first redevelopment project is DC2, one of our original IBXs that opened in the early 2000s, and home to our networking ecosystem in northern Virginia. Total estimated spend on this DC2 project will approximate $76 million broken into two primary categories of capex investment, redevelopment and recurring. We expect the $56 million redevelopment portion of the investment to yield meaningful additional space and power capacity, and, given the favorable pricing environment and high customer demand for the DC2 asset, we anticipate that this capacity will generate additional revenues and cash flow that should result in an IR well above our current stabilized asset yields. The remaining portion of the investment, which relates to maintaining our existing revenues, such as roof replacement, will be categorized as typical as recurring capex.   Now moving to Slide 10. Our capital investments have continued to deliver strong returns. Consistent with prior years in Q1, we completed the annual refresh of our IBX categorization exercise, and our stabilized asset count increased by a net six IBXs. Our now 180-stabilized asset increased recurring revenues by 5% year over year on a constant-currency basis, a quarter-over-quarter step-down as we lap the power price actions in 2023. Stabilized assets were collectively 84% utilized and generated a 26% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested.  And finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for updated summary of 2024 guidance and bridges. Do note all growth rates are on a normalized and constant-currency basis. For the full year 2024, we're maintaining our underlying revenue outlook with expected top-line growth of 7% to 8%, a reflection of our continued strong momentum. We're raising our underlying 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $5 million due to lower integration spend. We're raising our underlying 2024 AFFO guidance by $25 million to now grow between 10% and 13% compared to the previous year due to lower net interest expense. AFFO per share is now expected to grow between 8% and 11%. 2024 capex is expected to range between $2.8 billion and $3 billion including about $220 million of recurring capex spend.   So, let me stop here, and I'll turn the call back to Charles. And Jon, maybe I just want to add on to what Charles said there. I think it's important to appreciate that there's a fee stream that Equinix continues to enjoy on a larger revenue base to compensate for the higher costs that Charles alluded to. So, when I think about our all-in returns, they're really quite attractive as a business, and as we've talked about over the last few years, they're at a point where also that it's not only the recurring and nonrecurring stream that we get, I think there's opportunity over some period of time as our partners think about mentioning monetizing some of their investments to promote fees associated with it.  So, overall, again, I think the return profile, as Charles alluded to, is attractive, recognizing it's a higher cost model than it was previously, and you'll see that in our results. As it relates to really the debt that's being refinanced, I'm going to maybe approach it from a different perspective, because when you think about the cost, I really want to talk about the spread. Partially, the spread is really about what do we think we can borrow over whatever the base rate is. And as I made reference to it -- and I'm going to pause here for a second, Jon. Can you hear me? OK. Thank you. We had a funny -- something going on with our conference line here.   So, I think about it more spread, and again, I made the reference in the prepared remarks that we're going to look at the timing and the currency in which we borrow money. Suffice it to say between how we raise our capital and where we need it to refinance the existing debt, we're really looking at different markets. And so, the spread, I think, you should expect, based on where we were, I think somewhere between 105 and 115 basis points over base, whatever that is. Now, we might do it in euro, we might do it in dollar, and we could swap it depending on where the cash flows are needed, but suffice it to say, I think we're in a really good spot to enjoy a spread relative to others that is very competitive.   The last comment I would just say is, look, the markets are very volatile right now, but for obvious reasons, you see that. And that's why I think it's important to talk about the spread. Suffice it to say, I think we will have ample access to capital. It just depends on the timing of when we execute against that transaction. So, whether it's this year or it's next year refinancing, I think we're in a really good spot. And then I think as everybody is also aware, we have effectively an unused line of credit of $4 billion. So, if the markets aren't there for whatever reason, we can always draw on that and then refinance at a later date, but I don't foresee that as being an issue for us. I think it's reasonable. Of course, certain markets have different price points as you can appreciate. But one of the things I think, at a broad range, I think low teens is very, very appropriate on an unlevered basis. And I don't think we can -- you can't lose sight, generally speaking, of the supply and sort of the demand sort of dynamics here, that supply is going to continue to be -- it's going to be difficult to deliver into the marketplace, and so, when you look at the demand profile, I think pricing will continue to remain very, very firm. So, on an unlevered basis, we can get a really nice return and you add on the fee structure that we can enjoy as a business. And we recently announced the Silicon Valley 12 transaction. Again, we're very pleased with the overall structure and type of deal we're doing there, and we're working really hard to bring that to a fully stabilized position and you know what, the returns that you're considering. No, I think, well said, Charles. Thanks. Yeah, sure. It's one of those ones -- we've been working on this initiative for roughly a year, because it is a new category of expansion capex. And certainly, what you're trying to do is do two things.   One, we want to extend effectively the life of the asset further than people would typically anticipate. We're really going in and doing is really a heart transplant in a live environment. It's one of our highest-performing assets in the portfolio. And so, to give you a perspective, it's substantial because we refer to the $76 million, so you get a sense it's not something that's small. It's going to do two things. It's going to extend the life. It's going to create more revenue opportunities. And think of the range of 15% to 20% of an augmentation to an already high revenue environment. So that's the kind of value you can extract from it. The $20 million, the recurring capex component, will be doing roof replacement and some other things, and so that will go through the recurring line. But it's the $56 million -- in the prepared remarks, we really talked about the fact that this is going to get a yield, a return for us on an IRR basis better than stabilized assets. So, it gives you a sense it's in the 30s. If you decide to put sort of the end-of-life stuff that was recurring into the mix, you're still in the 20s. So, it gives you a sense of the investment decision that we're making is very, very substantial in a very critical asset.   The last thing I also want to leave you with, when we make this type of decision, part of the reason we were really calling it a redevelopment is this isn't like getting something done over a quarter. Again, high-density live environment is going to take two to three years to get this done. So, it gives you a sense of the level of investment. It's not like replacing a motor. We're basically taking out the guts of the entire IBX and replacing it with basic new and updated equipment. So, overall, I'd just say it's one of those things. There's not a huge portfolio, but I think over the next three to five years or something like that, you should expect something like six to eight assets could fall into that mix. Again, it has to be older than 20 years, and we have to invest more than $20 million for it to be considered a redevelopment capex item. Just add one, as Charles said, and I think it's important to understand that the level of work that was done since March 20th, so five, six weeks of work, was also included what was anticipated to be needed by the DOJ and the SEC. So, a tremendous amount of work has been done, and it's surrounded by what I would call the matters that relate to accounting irregularities. And I would expect, and I know this to be true, that they're already in dialogue with the parties. They're appropriately within dialogue with the parties. And again, this is going to be done independently as you would expect. Of course, they're going to draw on the resources of the company where needed to answer to questions and queries. So, I just think it takes a little bit of time, but getting to where we are that we filed the 10-Q yesterday should give you tremendous comfort on where we concluded. And, again, there is no adjustments, no findings. And so, as a result, I feel really good about where we are. And as Charles has said in his remarks, that related to both GAAP and non-GAAP, and I think that was really important. So, again, it will take probably a little bit of time, but overall, again, I feel very comfortable that by the filing of our 10-Q, it's a pretty good strong indication of where we are in the journey. And Mike, maybe just adding on to that, when you get to the second half of the year, you recognize that that, certainly it matters to the year, but it's not as important because it really matters to the year following. So, that's one of the things that you have to look at. We had a pretty good idea of what we think we could do for the first half of the year, and as Charles just mentioned, we're ahead of where we were. But offsetting some of that, of course, is some other things that have gone on inside the business, an example of metered power. And so, you're absorbing the fact that power costs have been down relative to where we were. We actually had a power price decrease, as you're aware, from the fourth quarter earnings call. And because of that, you're diluting a little bit of the growth. So, it's a combination of power being a little bit lower and sort of diluting it. In the second half of the year, we still anticipate to deliver against the expectations. But I would maybe characterize this as maybe a parting remark that when we look at risks and opportunities, the opportunities both in the revenue line and the cost line are much greater than those in the risk line. And so, where we are today, I just think that we're taking a posture that is appropriate given where we are at this time of year and just all the noise that's in the system. Yeah. Overall, I mean, if you look at some of the Canadian markets, it's not so much a constraint of generation, it's a constraint of distribution, and so Northern Virginia is an example of that, some of the Canadian markets, the Irish market, the Dublin market is another place. And so overall, it's sort of trying to optimize the environment as Charles alluded to, Singapore being that perfect example of deciding how you want to rerate the space and being very disciplined about what we sell, notwithstanding just a general thought about introducing a lot of new capacity into new markets, second tier, third tier markets for us. And they take longer to ramp, while at the same time, you have these major metros around the world where we're in dire need of incremental capacity. And so, that's what we're investing in. And so, it's really trying to optimize as best as we can across the portfolio, recognizing each market has a little bit of uniqueness to it. And so, working alongside what are we churning, where are we churning, and what does the inventory hold or engineering hold on some of the capacity as we augment with efficiency initiatives and the like, it's a combination of all these things that are factoring into our decision. And it goes back to the sort of the net cabinet billing discussion. When you look at the -- when you step back and say, well, that's part of what's causing that utilization level to be where it is, but you really have to step back and understand what is the revenue drivers of the business. You saw in our second quarter guide, we have a meaningful step up in revenues. A good roughly 65% to 70% of that is coming from MRR. And so, you know that we've got more revenue coming into the next quarter. We've got some MRR activity through xScale, but there's momentum in the business, and it doesn't necessarily appear the way that some of us would expect historically because it's not necessarily going to a lot of new incremental cabinets. There's more volume attached to the cabinets that we have. And so, it's a combination of those two things that I think are causing us to, I guess, be a little bit more cautious in what we talked about on a net billing cabinet basis, but we know that the revenue is there to support our growth. Charles alluded in his prepared remarks, we see the cabinet building number is going to increase and as a result, utilization will certainly continue to increase. I just don't know if it will happen at the rate that we would expect given all the other things that are going on in the business. And the caution that Charles alluded to, we are being cautious in our guide. We left the revenue guide constant, absent currency. We have momentum. We did better than we anticipated in the first quarter. Obviously, we made a reference to the fact the pipeline is exceedingly deep. That's a positive. But we're just not at a point to say, well, what does that mean from a billing cabinet basis? Are we going to alter basically the trajectory of our revenues based on what we've already guided? And there's just a number of factors that we're considering.   But overall, I'd just say there's strong momentum in the business. I think utilization will go up. I think net cabinet spilling will go up. I think based on the power utilization that we're selling, it will cause the density of cabinets to -- or a power sold per cabinet to continue to be elevated. And for all those reasons, that's why we have, I would think, momentum on the revenue line. But we're not yet prepared to change the trajectory of the revenue guide at this point."

            "name": "Charles Meyers",
            "content": "Thank you, Chip. Good afternoon and welcome to our Q1 earnings call.   We had a great start to 2024 driven by our highest Q1 bookings performance on record, strong conversion rates, completely favorable pricing dynamics, and lower-than-expected churn, all resulting in our 85th key quarter of top-line revenue growth, the longest such streak of any S&P 500 company. We closed more than 3,800 deals across more than 3,100 customers for the quarter demonstrating both the scale and the consistency of our go-to-market machine. And we again saw accelerating hyperscale demand translate into robust xScale leasing in both EMEA and Asia. While we continue to operate in an environment of broader economic uncertainty, and see some level of corresponding customer caution, our forward-looking pipeline is strong, and we remain optimistic about the opportunity ahead.   Digital transformation, particularly given the rapid adoption of AI, serves as a powerful catalyst for economic expansion, and our customers remain steadfastly committed to their digital initiatives, recognizing the pivotal role they play in fostering long-term revenue growth and driving operational efficiency.   As we continue to make digital infrastructure more powerful, more accessible and more sustainable, we're thrilled that Merrie Williamson has joined our team as chief customer and revenue officer. Merrie is an operational and visionary leader with unique skills and experience to help drive the next chapter of our growth and brings a proven track record of building new routes to market, enhancing the customer experience, and accelerating go-to-market productivity.   On the sustainability front, we continue to advance our bold future first agenda, with Gartner estimating that by 2027, 80% of CIOs will have performance metrics tied to the sustainability of their IT organization. It's clear to us that companies are prioritizing sustainability in their digital infrastructure decisions. We recently published our ninth Annual ISR Report and continued our industry leadership with 96% renewable energy coverage across our growing portfolio, marking our sixth consecutive year with over 90% coverage. Equinix PPAs now support more than one gigawatt of new clean energy in high-impact markets, and we continue to seek additional clean energy projects that will support our growth.   In late April, we were pleased to announce our first renewable PPA in Singapore, an important part of our plan to continue to grow in this strategically critical market. This project will provide 75 megawatts of solar and is in line with Singapore's Green Plan 2030, which seeks to have all business sectors supported by cleaner energy sources.   In parallel, we remain highly focused on improving the energy efficiency of our existing facilities as measured by power usage effectiveness. In 2023, we invested $78 million in high-returning efficiency projects, improving our average annual PP&E by over 8% year over year to 1.42, another lever in continuing to drive performance in our stabilized assets. We also continue to make progress on adjusting the thermostat in our facilities, with more than 50 of our data centers now operationally ready to enable A1A and strong industry support for the implementation of this important new temperature standard.   Turning to our results as depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q1 were $2.1 billion, up 7% over the same quarter last year driven by strong recurring revenues and xScale fees. Adjusted EBITDA was up 6% year-over-year and AFFO per share was meaningfully better than expectations due to strong operating performance. Interconnection revenues stepped up 9% year over year. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant-currency basis. Our unmatched scale and reach continue to drive performance in our data center services portfolio. Given strong underlying demand for digital infrastructure and the long duration in delivering new capacity, we see a growing scarcity mindset, and therefore we continue to invest broadly across our global footprint. We currently have 50 major projects underway in 34 markets across 21 countries, including 14 xScale builds, representing more than 16,000 cabinets of retail and more than 50 megawatts of xScale capacity through the end of 2024. This quarter we added new projects in Frankfurt, Madrid, Osaka, and Silicon Valley. Key multi-market wins this quarter include ServiceNow, expanding with Equinix in multiple locations globally, powering their continued growth including new GenAI workloads, and Wasabi technologies, a cloud object storage service provider expanding across all three regions to support their continued growth.   Our MRR per cabinet continues to rise increasing $119 year over year on a normalized and constant-currency basis to $2,258 driven by continued mark-to-market momentum, solid attach rates for interconnection and digital services, and increasing power densities.  With respect to our net cabinets building capacity constraints in certain key markets and the meaningful delta in power density between churned cabs and booked cabs continues to pressure this metric. But gross additions remain strong and our booked kilowatts in the retail business were at near-record levels. Given strong bookings and upcoming capacity additions, we expect billable cabs to increase in the second half and continue to see cabinet growth as part of the long-term growth story for the business.   Turning to our industry-leading global interconnection franchise, we now have more than 468,000 total interconnections deployed on our platform. In Q1, interconnection adds picked up to 6,200 supported by healthy gross adds and a moderation of consolidations into higher bandwidth connections, and we continue to see a healthy pricing dynamic with a roughly 16% spread in the quarter between churned interconnects and new additions. Internet exchange saw peak traffic up 5% quarter over quarter and 24% year over year to nearly 38 terabits per second led by the Americas.   We remain confident that Equinix's unique and durable advantages will continue to position our platform as the logical point of nexus for buyers and sellers of digital services to come together to fuel digital transformation and unlock the enormous potential of AI. This year, Gartner projects the spending on public cloud services will grow 20% to reach $679 billion as business needs and emerging technologies, including GenAI, drive cloud model innovation. We're seeing this translate into strong demand across multiple vectors with key cloud and IT customers broadly and with the hyperscalers specifically. In the quarter, we added one new native cloud on-ramp in Madrid, bringing us to 220 native cloud on-ramps across our portfolio, spanning 47 metros. This represents a nearly 40% market share of private cloud on-ramps in the markets where we operate.  We remain an integral and growing part of hyperscaler architectures, with these customers collectively representing more than $1.3 billion of annualized revenue in Q1 in our retail business alone, with deployments across an average of more than 60 of our data centers around the world. Importantly, we're also seeing strong go-to-market momentum with these market-shaping players as we partner to meet end-customer needs for hybrid cloud and private AI, making the hyperscalers some of our most productive channel partners.   In our xScale program, demand remains robust as cloud and AI needs are translating into strong pre-leasing activity. Since our last earnings call, we've pre-leased an incremental 48 megawatts capacity across our Frankfurt 10, Osaka 4, and Osaka 5 assets, including approximately 34 megawatts leased in mid-April. This brings total xScale leasing to nearly 350 megawatts globally with nearly 90% of our operational and underconstruction capacity leased, and a meaningful pipeline of opportunities to drive continued xScale momentum in the quarters to come.   Additionally, in mid-April, we announced our first U.S. xScale joint venture with PGIM Real Estate for our SV12x asset. When combined with our existing joint ventures in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America, this new JV will bring the expected global xScale portfolio to more than $8 billion in investment across more than 35 facilities and greater than 725 megawatts of power capacity when fully built out. We're also making good progress on additional planned xScale opportunities in the U.S, and we look forward to updating you on those developments in the coming quarters.   Shifting to our digital services portfolio, Equinix Fabric and Network Edge continue to overindex relative to the broader business. We see solid interest from customers looking to use the combination of Fabric, Network Edge and Metal for their digital infrastructure requirements. In support of this need, our engineering teams recently completed the integration of Metal and Fabric, significantly improving the VC creation experience for Metal users. Wins across the business included global security leader CrowdStrike, exploring a cloud-adjacent storage solution on platform Equinix in EMEA to leverage proximity to Equinix's rich ecosystem of cloud and storage provider customers. And an online AI and data analytics education company building out AI infrastructure to support learning for global practitioners.   Our channel program delivered another solid quarter with channel and partner influence deals accounting for over 30% of gross bookings and over 60% of new logos. We continue to see growth from the hyperscalers and from other key partners like AT&T, Avant, Dell, Kyndryl, and Zenlayer with wins across a wide range of industry segments and a broad mix of Equinix services. As we expand into new markets, our partners are accelerating our efforts to sell the global platform.   In Q1, we had a number of wins with Zenlayer in Malaysia, including delivering co-locations and interconnection solutions to a fintech firm, extending its reach into Kuala Lumpur, as well as supporting logistics consulting firm extending into Johor. We also saw a win with Kyndryl who also selected Platform Equinix to service some of its largest customers in Canada, including from the public sector.   So, let me turn the call over to Keith and cover the results for the quarter. Thanks, Keith.   In closing, we continue to see our customers derive compelling value from platform Equinix, leveraging our superior global reach, our scaled digital ecosystem, our market-leading interconnection platform and our greater-than-25-year track record of delivering on our commitments to fuel their investments in digital transformation. We are delighted to see the continued strength and fundamentals of our business, we remain highly confident in the integrity of our financials and we are as optimistic as ever that we'll continue to be an important partner for digital leaders as they accelerate AI investments and embrace hybrid and multi-cloud as the clear architecture of choice.  Before we turn to Q&A, I want to spend a few minutes on my transition. In reflecting on the last six years, it has been both a pleasure and a privilege to be the CEO of Equinix, showing up every day in service to our customers, to our employees, and to our shareholders. As I transition to the role of Executive Chairman later this quarter, I'll continue to take an active part in the business as Adaire Fox-Martin steps into the CEO role. Adaire is an extremely accomplished executive with a proven ability to deliver sustained value to the full range of stakeholders. I'm confident that she brings the experience, the skills, and the passion that we need to inspire our teams and support the evolving needs of our customers, driving growth and unlocking the extraordinary power of Platform Equinix. I look forward to working with Adaire in this next chapter of the Equinix journey.   I'd also like to thank Peter Van Camp, a shining example of the magic of Equinix over the last 25 years, and look forward to partnering with him as he moves from our Executive Chairman to Special Advisor to the board.   I look forward to further collaboration with both Adaire and the broader leadership team as we continue on our path as the world's digital infrastructure company capturing and creating new opportunities and leveraging our distinctive advantages to ensure digital leaders can harness our trusted platform to create and interconnect the foundational digital infrastructure that enhances our world.  So, let me stop there and open it up for questions. Yeah, Jon. I'll take the first piece and then Keith can both add to that and then take the second piece on the refinancing.   Look, xScale, you're right, continues to perform extremely well. We've seen huge pre-leasing activity over the last several quarters and I think we continue to see a lot of demand out there and a lot of confidence that we'll be able to effectively pre-sell that capacity as well and under returns that I think are in line with -- I mean, I do think we're seeing relatively firm pricing. I also think we're seeing rising costs, and so I think that the combination of those things leaves us with, I think, a level of underwriting that is at or above kind of where we probably were last year and feeling very confident in the range where we are on cash and cash returns overall. Jon, I would back up a little bit to the xScale and just say in addition to the underwriting continuing to be strong, pre-leasing activity strong, I think we're seeing exactly it play out very much as we expected in terms of how the whole thing fits together from a platform strategy standpoint. So very pleased with the xScale business and very pleased with how it fits in overall in terms of driving the broader value of the platform to our customers. Thanks, Jon. Sure. I'll give you a bit of that, and Keith can certainly add to it.   The mechanics that we did, the audit committee obviously was the one conducting that, and we have a very experienced audit committee acting independently. And then they retained independent advisors in WilmerHale, the law firm that led the investigation, as well as AlixPartners, the forensic accountants, independent forensic accountants that led that. And they looked at, particularly surrounding, obviously, the accounting-related matters that were sort of referenced in the allegations in the short report. And as a public company, as frustrating as it might be, that's our obligation to undertake an investigation to look into those. And so, we tried to keep people focused on the business, while that investigation took place and we tried to focus on serving our customers while the audit committee led that investigation alongside the advisors. They collected the right information that they deemed as appropriate to validate and understand the concerns that were there and making a judgment and an assessment about the accuracy of our financial reporting, both on a GAAP basis and the non-GAAP measures that were involved here. And again, as we said in the press release and in the prepared remarks here, they came back with a level of confidence in those results and in the accuracy of those results. And so, while the investigation remains open, in large part, because we have to sort of navigate the subpoenas with the SEC and the DOJ, we feel great about the outcome. I feel like it really speaks to the integrity of our team, which, as I said, I have great confidence in and in the integrity of our financials. So, I'll leave it there, and if there's anything you want to add there Keith? Yeah, I'll just add a little more color, Nick, in that. So, I think that the type of capex investment, as you said, is in the base infrastructure required to operate the data center, power, cooling, etc. But the big difference here is that -- and we're seeing this dynamic play out because of the sort of rising density needs across the business, where we are, at times, needing to derate space and actually have space come off of the sort of -- go on to what we refer to as engineering hold. And in situations where you can unlock additional usable power, either through power efficiency projects or this kind of redevelopment investment, where you're putting entirely new equipment in, if you can unlock that power and match it to the space that is unused or on hold, you get meaningful, incremental capacity. And that's really the big difference here, is you're getting incremental capacity that starts to feel like another phase of a project. And so, in this case, DC2 is coming out of the stabilized assets, which, by the way, hurts stabilized asset pool, goes back into expansion. And the reason is because it's a really meaningful uptick in the overall capacity available from that facility. And that's really the litmus test that we use to say, OK, is it appropriate to qualify as a redevelopment project? And in this case, very, very much so given the customer demand for that asset. The short answer is absolutely. We're going to continue to grow the overall platform on the xScale side and retail side, but I think clearly there is a ton of demand out there, and we think we have a very, very credible story. And I think, as you said, the leasing momentum that we have generated over the last several quarters is quite indicative of that. And so, yeah, what we have left, we feel confident we're going to be able to lease effectively and as I said in the script, we're also excited to give you updates on what we have talked about pretty openly, and we've announced the SV12x asset, the first xScale in the Americas, but we also are deeply engaged in a set of conversations around how we're going to expand our xScale platform in the U.S. and the Americas more broadly. And so, we don't have anything specific to share with you, but we will in the not-too-distant future, and we look forward to that conversation. In terms of -- now we're not yet prepared to sort of size that precisely, but I will say that when you look back at what we said when we first talked about xScale at the Analyst Day, I don't know when that was, '18 or something, and what we said was what we thought it was going to be. It's certainly proven to be a lot more than that. And I think it continues to be a super exciting opportunity. Very proud of the team that continues to run that business for us, and they're doing great things and we're excited about the value that deliver for our customers. Yeah. I mean, the billable cabs, it comes from a few different things. You're right. We've always talked about the volatility in billable cabs based partially on timing of installs. It's not so much a longer sales cycle. Sometimes, it is a bit of a longer install cycle, and so, depending on the timing of installs and in fact the timing of churn, you can see volatility in any quarter. That's why we've always sort of told people over the years to look at a rolling four-quarter metric, but even that has really been under pressure, and has been under pressure primarily because of power density, and I think that kind of makes sense to people, but we're realizing, I think, that we really need to give people a bit more to hang their hat on relative to that particular metric. So, let me give you some of the math, I think, that will help people understand the billable cabs metric and how it plays here and what's causing the bit of pressure on that. We guide the 2% to 2.5% churn rate on our recurring revenue each quarter. So, we're running today at an MRR run rate of about $667 million. So, if you take 2% of that figure, at the low end of the range, so you're at $13 million to $14 million in MRR churn in any given quarter. As we said, our MRR per cab is averaging right now at 2,258. So, if you take that and divide those two together, you'd be churning roundabout 6,000 cabs in any given quarter. And more than that, if we're churning cabs that are at a lower-than-average MRR per cab, which candidly we would hope to be doing, if you're going to churn some cabs, it should be ones that are below the average, right? And so, in Q1, we were churning cabs that were at an average of 4.4 kilowatts. We were adding back cabs at an average of 5.8 kilowatts. And so, when you do that math, all in, in terms of that relatively large gap in density, you're looking at about a 1,500-cab hole that you've got to fill. So actually, staying flat on cabs is really a pretty significant win.   The density increase that's causing that sort of hole in the bucket on cab count though is a really important factor in driving the MRR per cab. So, if you go and if you look at our year-over-year growth on billable cabs, Q1 to Q1, last year to this year, it's softer for sure. It's only up about 1%. But over that same time frame, our MRR per cab is up 6% across the estate, and so, you add those two together and the composite gives you that 7% growth. So, long way of saying that, in other words that stable to slightly growing cab count is certainly a different dynamic than what we have seen. But the growth is coming. It's just coming in a slightly different shape. And so, we're still driving the growth in the business and getting the economic returns that we were anticipating. So, I think that, for us, rather than looking for a new indicator, I think, what we're going to look to do is moderate expectations on the cab growth and say, look, we're having to cover that whole quarter-over-quarter from a density standpoint, but it's really driving the MRR per cab, and it's the composite of those two things that really give you the solid growth model going forward. Yeah, I'm trying to decide which order to take them in. We feel like we've got the metrics that we need and I think there's a lot of complexity to introducing new metrics to the -- and so I think that the MRR per cab, even though it's probably going to have a slightly different growth profile than it has, combined with the MRR per cab are really the billable cab count and the MRR per cab. And the product of those two is really the metric that we continue to come back to. And so, I think that rather than introduce a new metric, we're going to really stick to those two and try to give you better visibility to what you should expect along the product of those two, which it really drives the growth.  As it relates to the investigation, I would say that I think we can't comment in detail on the specifics of the DOJ and the SEC subpoenas, but I would say that the investigation work conducted by the audit committee and by the independent advisors who I just talked about over the several weeks seems like an eternity, but it's been the last several weeks and a lot of amazing work done really represents, I think, the foundation of what we believe is needed to address the matters in the DOJ and SEC subpoenas. And it's not unusual for I think, the sort of discussions with those parties, DOJ and SEC to lag and take a bit longer. But I feel like we've got our arms around that solidly, and we'll provide an update on that in whatever time frame that requires. Unfortunately, I think that's very hard for us to provide any specificity around.  Keith, do you want to add that? Yeah, I think the shorter answer to your question probably would have been not a lot of light between those I think, and I think we feel confident that we're going to be able to navigate those. Again, how timely I'm not sure, because I think those are probably not things that are frequently rapid, just due to the parties you're dealing with. We'll navigate them on as rapid a time frame as we can, or the audit committee and the independent investigators will, and then we'll report that back to you as we know more. Sure. Yeah. Thanks for the well wishes, Mike, and thanks for the questions.   I would say that the second half guide or the second half, I think, outlook for us doesn't look dramatically different. I think we had said that we're clearly looking at some acceleration in the back half of the year from a bookings perspective. And again, we feel good about the pipeline. We had a strong Q1, and so we probably had a slightly better Q1, and that gives us a little running start at that back half of the year. But I also think we are seeing -- although we saw lower churn than we had forecasted or expected in the prior guide, I do think we are continuing to see some level of churn in the system that I think we have to continue to navigate. And so, I think there -- not any big changes in the outlook and that's why again, you saw us maintain that outlook overall. Yeah. And I mean, Mike, we've used this term on the last few calls as sort of crosscurrents, right, which is a sort of strange combination of a lot of interest in demand around digital transformation broadly speaking, around AI, in particular. I think we're still seeing that. I think we're seeing great interest in AI and in hybrid AI, private AI, sort of mixed with public cloud as a sort of preferred architecture for a lot of the AI workloads that we're looking at. I think we're seeing a lot of customers looking at where they want to place their data. And I think they are increasingly reaching the conclusion that sort of proximate to the cloud is the right answer, and I think we're really well-positioned to benefit from that, and we're seeing some demand there. We're seeing a nice pipeline on the managed DGX opportunity that we have out in the market with NVIDIA. And yet at the same time, we are also seeing, as I characterized in the script, some level of customer caution, some level of tightening and desire for optimization in a still somewhat uncertain macro environment. And so, I think it's all those things together that led us to say, hey, this guide is a good one. We feel like we've got opportunity to outperform against it, particularly, on the FFO line, but that's kind of where we landed and sort of overall balance for the guide. Yeah. I would still characterize it as quite early days because I do think there is a ton of interest in AI, but I think that the actual execution of implementing infrastructure, driving workloads, etc. is I think still relatively early in the cycle. Now, I do think there is a lot of attention on really large-scale training workloads, and I do think we're seeing some of the demand in our xScale business being driven by demand from hyperscalers, which again are the largest customers of our xScale offering. And so, I think that is probably ahead of the game, but I think what we're now seeing is a really rich pipeline of enterprise training opportunities, as well as inference opportunities where inference is more distributed. And we've been saying this all along, I think that's where the unique different creation of Equinix is likely to be because of our highly distributed footprint, and because I think we bring that blend of capabilities to the table not only xScale. And we did see an uptick, I will say this quarter, in larger footprint opportunities, and I think some of that is really associated with AI-related workloads, both service provider and enterprise. And so, we're seeing a little bit of a different mix. I think still relatively early, but I think a lot of room for optimism in the AI opportunity overall for us. Yeah, great question. I mean, I think there's a few markets around the world that we have recently added capacity or it is around the corner. A great example would be the New York Metro where we are already pre-selling capacity in that, but don't yet have as much available to actually bill into as we would like. And so, I think that's a classic area of constraint. We've also seen, of course, Singapore is a more, I think, more protracted area of constraint in the business. And it's one of the reasons why we talked about our sustainability efforts there, which were quite central in our ability to gain incremental capacity to sort of awards, if you will, from the Singaporean government. And so, I think that one's going to be a little bit of a longer slog for us. And I think, unfortunately, it means that we're going to have to continue to be opportunistic about churn and trying to rerate that and use that to continue to serve the capacity that is most critical there. But those are a couple of key examples. What might be some of the other ones, Keith, you already had some constraints there? But I do think that -- I mean, look, the stabilized assets are 84% utilized overall. I think we've got room in the class that just went in for additional utilization. And so, I think that we absolutely are going to continue to see improving utilization, but we are continuing to add capacity for sure just given the level of demand that's out there. So, I think it'll just depend on how that ebbs and flows into the utilization number."
